1.   Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared according to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Section 210.8-03(b)
of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( GAAP ) have been omitted.  

In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the year ending December 31, 2016. The Company s financial statement have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements of the Company for year ended December 31, 2015, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

2.   Organization
and Significant Accounting Policies   

Organization   

Minn
Shares Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 22, 2010 to effect the
reincorporation of Minn Shares Inc., a Minnesota corporation (Minn Shares Minnesota) in the State of Delaware.  

The
current business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition of or merger with an existing company.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Income
Taxes   

Deferred
income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred
taxes are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes
in tax laws and rates on the date of the enactment.  

In
evaluating the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that
the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Management establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that
all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be utilized.  The ultimate realization of deferred income
tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income, which must occur prior to the expiration of the net operating
loss carryforwards.  

Loss
Per Common Share   

Basic
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common share
equivalents when dilutive.  There are no common share equivalents outstanding.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
carrying value of current financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short term nature.  

3.   Going
Concern   

The
Company is a shell company, has not earned any revenues from operations since 2001, suffered recurring losses from operations,
and has a shareholders  deficit. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability
to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is also
dependent on its ability to locate a suitable target company and ultimately enter into a possible reverse merger with such company.
Management s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related
party advances, however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  

4 .    Due
to Globe Resources Group   

On
May 16, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement (the  Option Agreement ) with The Globe Resources Group, LLC ( Globe ),
pursuant to which Globe acquired the right to purchase, at any time through the date that is twelve (12) months from the date
of the Option Agreement, controlling shares of the Company s common stock. Specific details of the Option Agreement are
set forth in the Company s Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 22, 2013.  

Upon
execution of the Option Agreement, Globe delivered an advance of $59,593 to the Company to cover its expenses during the Option
Period, as further described in the Option Agreement. On May 13, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to extend the option
expiration date an additional 30 days. In connection with the extension, and again on August 7, 2014, Globe delivered advances
of $15,000 and $28,018, respectively, to the Company to cover specific current payables and legal and administrative expenses
related to the extension. On June 5, 2014, the Company received notification that Globe had elected not to exercise its option
to purchase shares of the Company under the Option Agreement. Accordingly, the Option Agreement expired on June 15, 2014. 

Due
to Globe consisted of advances and interest payable to Globe. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $117,407 and $113,559,
including $14,796 and $10,948, respectively of accrued interest, was owed to Globe. Prior to expiration, the loan bore annual
interest at 5%. Interest expense was $1,282 and $1,282 for the three month and $3,848 and $3,848 for the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

As
required by the Option Agreement, the Company will seek to find a third party purchaser. If sold, any consideration received will
be used first to pay off related selling costs, and then repay related party payables (see Note 5). Remaining proceeds, if any,
shall be used to repay advances made by Globe. In the event the Company does not consummate a sale with a third party purchaser,
no amounts under the loan are payable to Globe.  

5.   Due
to Related Parties   

Due
to related parties consisted of advances and expenses paid on behalf of the Company by Paramount Trading, Ltd. ( Paramount ),
a company owned by the Company s current majority shareholder, and the Company s President and director.  At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $279,950 and $245,961, including $50,567 and $42,446, respectively of accrued interest,
is owed to these related parties. The loans bear annual interest at 5% and are due on demand. Interest expense was $2,806 and
$2,433 for the three month and $8,122 and $7,107 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

   (Unaudited)   

6.   Income
Taxes   

At
September 30, 2016 the Company had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $779,000 for income tax
purposes that expire starting in 2018. The Company s state net operating carry forwards started expiring in 2015 and
the Company estimates that $40,000 of state net operating loss will expire at the end of 2016. As of September 30, 2016,
there is approximately $536,000 of state net operating loss carryforwards.  The Company established a valuation
allowance for the full amount of net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2016 because it cannot demonstrate that it is more
likely than not that it will realize the benefit of that asset. In addition, future utilization of the available net
operating loss carryforward may be limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 as a result of changes in
ownership.  

It
is the Company s practice to recognize penalties and/or interest related to income tax matters in the interest and penalties
expense. There are no interest and penalties recognized in the statements of operations or accrued on the balance sheets.  

The
Company is subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income tax examination by tax authorities for all years for which a loss carryforward
is utilized in subsequent periods.  

7.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company s management has reviewed and considered all recent accounting pronouncements and believe there are none that could
potentially have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results or disclosures.  

Item
2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

Forward
Looking Statement Notice    

Certain
statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are  forward-looking statements  (within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements
of Minn Shares Inc. ( we ,  us ,  our  or the  Company ) to be materially different
from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking
statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company s
plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving the continued expansion of business. Assumptions relating to
the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future
business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of
the Company. Although the Company believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the
assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly
Report will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included
herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the
objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.  

Corporate
History    

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 22, 2010, to effect the reincorporation (the  Reincorporation )
of Minn Shares Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( Minn Shares Minnesota ) in the State of Delaware. On December 1, 2010,
we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) with Minn Shares Minnesota, pursuant to which
Minn Shares Minnesota was merged with and into the Company.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the time of the merger,
Minn Shares Minnesota ceased to exist and the Company continued as the surviving corporation.  As a result, the Company
succeeded to all of the assets, property, rights, privileges, franchises, immunities and powers of Minn Shares Minnesota
and assumed all of the duties, liabilities, obligations and restrictions of every kind.  As a result of the Reincorporation,
the legal domicile of the Company is the State of Delaware. It has no subsidiaries and the Company selected December 31 as its
fiscal year end.  The Company is currently quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace maintained by the OTC Markets Group Inc.
under the symbol  MSHS.   

Minn
Shares Minnesota was incorporated in the State of Minnesota on January 15, 1987, under the name H. H.   P. Yogurt, Inc., and
on September 8, 1994, changed its name to Minn Shares Inc. Minn Shares Minnesota operated two yogurt shops: one in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, and one in St. Paul, Minnesota. Both stores were ultimately closed by October 1990, at which time Minn Shares Minnesota
ceased to engage in the yogurt business, and focused its business on locating a suitable merger or acquisition candidate or investigating
the possibility of becoming a closed-end, non-diversified management company.  

In
August 1993, Minn Shares Minnesota filed a registration application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
to become a closed-end, non-diversified management company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the  Investment Company
Act ), and began activity shortly thereafter. On August 3, 2001, Minn Shares Minnesota filed an Application for Deregistration
of Certain Registered Investment Companies on Form N-8F (the  Form N-8F ), which was subsequently amended on September
14, 2001, at which time Minn Shares Minnesota requested deregistration. On September 27, 2001, Minn Shares Minnesota s registration
under the Investment Company Act ceased to be in effect.  

Subsequent
to the filing of the Form N-8F, as amended, and deregistration under the Investment Company Act, Minn Shares Minnesota appointed
a liquidating agent to handle the winding-up of its business activities, affairs and obligations, distributing any remaining assets
to its shareholders with the intent to ultimately dissolve Minn Shares Minnesota. All of the remaining net assets were distributed
to its shareholders by the liquidating agent during the period between 2001 through 2009.  

In
2009, upon the approval of Minn Shares Minnesota s shareholders, Minn Shares Minnesota approved a plan to cancel its dissolution
and accepted an offer from Paramount Trading, Ltd., a Nevada limited liability company ( Paramount ), to purchase
a controlling interest in Minn Shares Minnesota. Subsequently, Minn Shares Minnesota was merged with and into the Company and
was reincorporated in the State of Delaware.  

On
December 1, 2010, as described above, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 1, 2010, pursuant to
which the Company issued an aggregate of 1,191,348 shares of common stock to the shareholders of Minn Shares Minnesota in exchange
for the cancellation of 11,913,455 shares of Minn Shares Minnesota common stock issued and outstanding before the Reincorporation.  

Since
December 2001, Minn Shares Minnesota has not engaged in any business activities other than for the purpose of collecting and distributing
its assets, paying, satisfying and discharging any existing debts and obligations and doing other acts required to liquidate and
wind up its business and affairs.  

Plan
of Operation    

The
Company was reorganized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The current business purpose of the Company is to seek
the acquisition of or merger with an existing company.  The Company will not restrict any potential candidate targets
to any specific business, industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business. The Company intends to
establish a market for freely trading shares following the conclusion of a successful business combination and commencing business
as an operating company.  

The
Company, pursuant to SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ),
qualifies as a  shell company,  because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.  Our
principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through
a combination with a business rather than immediate-short term earnings. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to
cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination.
The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those
requirements.  

In
addition, the Company is an  emerging growth company , as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
( JOBS Act ), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies  including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements
of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive
compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.  

The
Company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section
102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different
effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election,
our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  

We
will remain an  emerging growth company  until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our
revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period,
(3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market
value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently
completed second fiscal quarter. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a  smaller reporting company ,
as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth
company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller
reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of
the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited
financial statements, instead of three years.  

The
Company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow.  During the next twelve months
we anticipate incurring costs related to:  

(i)         filing
Exchange Act reports, and  

(ii)        investigating,
analyzing and consummating an acquisition.  

We
intend to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional
amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. As of the last date
of the period covered by this report, the Company has $3,377 in cash. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to
secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our
ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent
on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management s
plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances;
however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  

The
Company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional
funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business
which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business
combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which
desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense,
and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  

Any
target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth,
including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent
in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we
may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management
will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly
ascertain or assess all significant risks. Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business
combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which
is likely to occur as a result of our management s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to
achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because
it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.  

The
Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic
conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes
that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits
of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional
equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for
providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions,
joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different
industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of
such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  

As
of the date of this report, we are in late stage discussions with an entity to consummate a business combination. However, at
this time, we are not a party to a binding agreement with such entity and there are no assurances we will be able to complete
such business combination in a timely manner, if at all.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had assets equal to $3,377, comprised exclusively of cash. The Company had assets equal to
$17, comprised exclusively of cash, as of December 31, 2015. The Company s current liabilities as of September 30,
2016, totaled $459,138, comprised of payables, accrued expenses, and amounts due to related parties. This compares to the Company s
total liabilities as of December 31, 2015 of $368,047, comprised of payables, accrued expenses and amounts due to related parties.
The Company can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.  

The
following is a summary of the Company s cash flows provided by (used in) operating and financing activities:  

The
Company has nominal assets. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its
ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. In addition, the
Company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and
capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.  

Results
of Operations    

Since
December 2001, the Company has not engaged in any business activities other than for the purpose of collecting and distributing
its assets, paying, satisfying and discharging any existing debts and obligations and doing other acts required to liquidate and
wind up its business and affairs. No revenue has been generated by the Company since 2001. It is unlikely the Company will
have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company, of which there can be no assurance. It
is management s assertion that these circumstances may hinder the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
Company s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates.   

For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $46,218 and $87,731, respectively, comprised of legal, accounting, audit,
interest expense and other professional service fees comprised of the preparation and the filing of the Company s periodic
reports and potential business combination expenses. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a net loss of $6,750 and $36,796, respectively, comprised
of legal, accounting, audit and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the preparation and the filing of the
Company s periodic reports and interest expense.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.    

Contractual
Obligations    

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this
information.   

Emerging
Growth Company    

As
an  emerging growth company  under the JOBS Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period for
complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the
adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those
standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies
that comply with public company effective dates.  

Item
3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

As
a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information
required by this Item.  

Item
4.  Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of our President (principal executive officer and principal financial
officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 promulgated under
the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in such reports is accumulated
and communicated to management, including our President, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based upon that evaluation, our President concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified by the SEC due to an inherent material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting due
to our status as having a sole officer. However, our President believes that the financial statements included in this report
fairly presents, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the respective periods
presented.  

Changes
in Internal Controls    

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

of more than five percent of any class of voting securities is a party or as to which any of its property is subject, and no such
proceedings are known to the Company to be threatened or contemplated against it.
