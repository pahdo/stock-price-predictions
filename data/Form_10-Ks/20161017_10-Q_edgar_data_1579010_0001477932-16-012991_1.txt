              Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc.  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  August 31, 2016     Note 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      Nature of Operations    Organization   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. ( HISP ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Energy Source Distributors Inc., ( ESD ) (collectively , the  Company ). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.     HISP was incorporated in Delaware in April 2013 and acquired ESD during July 2016. The Company currently markets and sells traditional Hispanic beverages and ethnic food packaged products and will license and/or acquire existing brands and distributors of Hispanic products.      Basis of Presentation   The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods presented have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The accompanying condensed financial statements and the information included under the heading Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Form 10-K as of May 31, 2016. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results of a full year.      Revenue Recognition   In general, the Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The following policies reflect specific criteria for the various revenue streams of the Company: Revenue is recognized at the time the product is delivered. Provision for sales returns is estimated based on the Company's historical return experience. Revenue is presented net of returns.      Use of Estimates   The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the condensed balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     7         
  
  Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc.  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  August 31, 2016     Note 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)      Net Loss Per Common Share   The Company calculates net income (loss) per share based on the authoritative guidance. Basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. During periods in which the Company incurs losses, common stock equivalents, if any, are not considered, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. As of August 31, 2016, the convertible notes payable, which could be converted into approximately 52,000 shares of common stock, were outstanding.      Income Taxes   The Company utilizes the accrual method of accounting for income taxes. Under the accrual method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized.     The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a  more-likely-than-not  threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of August 31, 2016, and does not expect this to change significantly over the next 12 months.   Stock-Based Compensation   The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires all share-based compensation payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value on the issuance date.     Equity instruments granted to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505, Equity. The final measurement date for the fair value of equity instruments with performance criteria is the date that each performance commitment for such equity instrument is satisfied or there is a significant disincentive for non-performance.  8        
  
  Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc.  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  August 31, 2016     Note 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)      Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.      Accounts Receivable   The Company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, maintaining an allowance for potential credit losses. Uncollectible accounts are written off at the time they are deemed uncollectible. Accounts receivable is reported net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on management's estimate of the amount of receivables that will actually be collected. As of February 29, 2016 and May 31, 2015, an allowance for doubtful accounts was not necessary.      Inventory   Inventory consists of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market value.      Recent Pronouncements    Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncement, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.  Note 2. ACQUISITION OF ESD     In July 2016, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the  Credit Facility ) with TCA Global Credit Master Fund L.P. ( TCA ) for a total amount of $7.5 million. However, as of the execution date of the Credit Facility, only $1.6 million was allocated by TCA to the Company for working capital financing and for any other purpose permitted under the terms of the Credit Facility. Energy Source Distributors, Inc. ( ESD ) is Corporate Guarantor to the Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company paid advisory fees to TCA in the amount of $350,000, through the issuance of 374,332 shares of common stock. On July 5, 2016, the Company borrowed $650,000 from the Credit Facility and used the proceeds to acquire ESD for $450,000; payoff a note payable in the amount of $32,534; $74,466 was used to pay vendors for inventory purchases and $93,000 was paid to TCA for closing fees. The credit facility has a maturity date of January 5, 2017 which may be extended for an additional six months at the lender s discretion. The credit facility requires fees and interest only payments at 12% during the first two months. Principal payments begin in the third month. At the maturity date, all unpaid principal and interest is due. During the current quarter, the Company issued an additional 157,480 shares of common stock to satisfy a default notice in the amount of $200,000.  On July 5, 2016, the Company acquired all of the net assets of Energy Source Distributors, Inc. by purchasing all of the outstanding shares of common stock for $450,000.   9

The note requires payment of unpaid principal and accrued interest upon maturity in August 2017. Unamortized OID and loan costs totaled $7,735 at May 31, 2016. There is a prepayment premium of 125% of the loan balance being paid prior to the maturity date. Upon an event of default as described in the Note, the Company would incur penalties and fees and the annual interest rate would increase to 22%. At August 31, 2016, accrued interest of $1,045 is reported as accounts payable and accrued expenses.

The Lender Conversion Price is defined in the Note as being $3.00 per share, however, in the event the Market Capitalization falls below $20,000,000.00 at any time, then in such event (a) the Lender Conversion Price for all Lender Conversions occurring after the first date of such occurrence shall equal the lower of the Lender Conversion Price and the Market Price as of any applicable date of Conversion.     Subject to certain conditions, a Conversion Factor of 70% shall apply to the Lender Conversion Price, subject to the following adjustments: (i) If at any time the average of the three (3) lowest Closing Bid Prices in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding any date of measurement is below $1.00, then in such event the then-current Conversion Factor shall be reduced by 10% for all future conversions; (ii) if at any time after the effective date of the Note, the Conversion Shares are not Eligible, then the then-current Conversion Factor will automatically be reduced by 5% for all future conversions; and, (iii) in addition to the Default Effect, as defined, if any Major Default occurs, as defined, after the effective date of the Note, the Conversion Factor shall automatically be reduced for all future conversions by an additional 5% for each of the first three (3) Major Defaults that occur.       Under the terms of the Note, on June 17, 2016, the note holder elected to convert $12,500 of the outstanding principal and accrued interest balance into 18,315 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.6825 per share.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received $167,450 of cash proceeds from the Buyer in exchange for a loan payable in the amount of $214,200 secured by future sales proceeds. The difference between the cash received and the cash to be paid from future sales proceeds of $46,750 was recognized as capitalized financing costs and is being amortized over the repayment period.

  Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc.  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  August 31, 2016         Note 7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  The Company purchases its inventory from a supplier related through common ownership and management. The Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company is the supplier's President. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company has a minority interest in the supplier. The amount of inventory purchased from the supplier during the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 was approximately $12,817 and $111,059, respectively. As of August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, accounts payable to this supplier of $-0- and $10,000, respectively, were reported as accounts payable and accrued expenses.     Note 8. BASIS OF REPORTING  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.     The Company has incurred losses from inception of approximately $1,840,000, which, among other factors, raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management's plans to raise additional capital from the sale of stock and receive additional loans from related parties. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.      NOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS         On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( Purchase Agreement ) with Anson Investments Master Fund LP ( Anson ) pursuant to which Anson purchased the Company s unsecured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $440,000 ( Note ).

As additional consideration for the purchase of the note, the Company will issue 1,100,000 of its common stock to Anson.         Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued its Common Stock Purchase Warrant to Anson. The Warrant allows Anson to purchase up to 400,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.85 per share until September 30, 2021.

                ITEM   2.   MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS   OF   FINANCIAL CONDITION    AND   RESULTS   OF   OPERATIONS   FORWARD    LOOKING  STATEMENTS      This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements rather than historical facts that involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of forward- looking words such as  may,   will,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   continue  or other similar words. Such forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations of future results of operations or financial condition. However, there may be events in the future that we are unable to accurately predict or control and there may be risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The forward-looking statements included herein are only made as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.       BASIS     OF   PRESENTATION         The unaudited financial statements of Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. ( HISP,  the  Company,   our  or  we ), should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements presented herein reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for fair presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.     We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require that management make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from these estimates.      COMPANY OVERVIEW       Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. (the  Company  or  HISP ,  us ,  we   our ) was incorporated on April 15, 2013 as a Delaware company and is   engaged in the distribution of proprietary, licensed and third party Hispanic and ethnic food and beverages throughout the United States. HISP has already begun to distribute fruit juices, nectars, and milk based products and expects begin to distribute teas, carbonated drinks, dry goods, preserves, frozen foods and bakery products. The brands distributed are under a proprietary basis (through distribution agreements and/or exclusive licensing arrangements). Our brands emulate the flavors, tastes, and traditions which have been known for generations among the Hispanic and other ethnic groups and are now becoming part of the American mainstream diet.      Our objective is to grow as rapidly as possible (both organically and via strategic alliances and acquisitions) using the public capital markets for access to capital. The companies and assets sought by us will be those that already have market penetration in the following segments: (1) Food Distribution and Manufacturing; (2) Beverage Brands and (3) Distribution Food Service.     Our management team has over 30 years of combined experience in the Hispanic food and beverage industry to generate these sales. In July 2016, we acquired the company s first Direct Store Delivery ( DSD ) in an all cash purchase. HISP has new key personnel with previous managerial experience to begin the implementation of increasing our sales to potentially growing the business with a target of $5MM in revenues with plans to continue its growth via mergers and acquisitions.     15         
  
  In October 2013 we signed a distribution agreement with Gran Nevada Beverage, Inc. ( Gran Nevada ), an entity related through common management. The agreement provides us with the right to sell and distribute Gran Nevada's beverages in Texas and California with purchase prices at the then applicable wholesale prices charged to Gran Nevada's distributors. The agreement is for an initial term of five years with automatic renewals of successive five year terms unless terminated.  We initiated sales and distribution operations in March 2014.     On October 30, 2015, the company entered into an agreement to acquire a 20% minority equity interest in Just Buns Inc. in exchange for 20,000 shares to the Company s common stock. The Company also entered into an exclusive Distribution Agreement with Just Buns, Inc. to distribute their proprietary  Ensaimades  sold under the name  Swirly Buns . As of the date of this filing the Company has not finalized these transactions. Upon finalization the Company will issue 20,000 shares of common stock.     Effective July 5, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Energy Sources Distributors, Inc. ( ESD ) from its three founding shareholders. ESD provides wholesale distribution of specialty beverage products from its headquarters in Gilroy, California. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $450,000 in cash. We retained one of the selling founders as General Manager for a term of twelve (12) months pursuant to an employment agreement to manage operations at the ESD facility in Gilroy, California. ESD is now a wholly-owned subsidiary.       In July 2016, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the  Credit Facility ) with TCA Global Credit Master Fund L.P. ( TCA ) for a total amount of $7.5 million. However, as of the execution date of the Credit Facility, only $1.6 million was allocated by TCA to the Company for working capital financing and for any other purpose permitted under the terms of the Credit Facility. Energy Source Distributors, Inc. ( ESD ) is Corporate Guarantor to the Credit Facility. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company paid advisory fees to TCA in the amount of $350,000, through the issuance of 374,332 shares of common stock. On July 5, 2016 the Company borrowed $650,000 from the Credit Facility and used the proceeds to acquire ESD for $450,000; payoff a note payable in the amount of $32,534; $74,466 was used to pay vendors for inventory purchases and $93,000 was paid to TCA for closing fees. The credit facility has a maturity date of January 5, 2017 which may be extended for an additional six months at the lender s discretion. The credit facility requires fees and interest only payments at 12% during the first two months. Principal payments begin in the third month. At the maturity date all unpaid principal and interest is due. During the current quarter the Company issued an additional 157,480 shares of common stock to satisfy a default notice in the amount of $200,000.  Our principal executive offices are located at 575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor, New York NY 10022 and our telephone number is (866) 928-5070.        CURRENT OPERATIONS       Sales      The Company currently markets and sells traditional Hispanic and ethnic food packaged products and will license and/or acquire existing brands and distributors of Hispanic products. Brands sought by HISP and primarily engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling unique, premium, non-alcoholic beverages as well as all natural food products that are targeted towards Hispanic and ethnic-neutral consumers.     16         
  
      Production and Distribution       The Company buys prepackaged goods for distribution through various channels. The Company distributes third party brands as well as a proprietary brand named GRAN NEVADA under an exclusive distribution agreement for the U.S.     As of August 2016, Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. (HISP) distributed over 20 brands mainly through its Energy Source Distribution (ESD) subsidiary as well as sold the GRAN NEVADA beverages to other wholesalers that are primarily ethnic food distributors and mostly located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.     HISP sells to several distributors and regularly seeks to broaden its distribution channels from its current network of a dozen to over 100 by the end of 2017. The Company has engaged third party sales and marketing brokers in many areas of the country. The Company also intends to sell directly to retailers, including large chain stores.     Intellectual Property     The Company is in the process of securing a trademark for its name and logo. HISP does not have its trademark registered for Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. as of August 2016.       Competition      As a distributor of Hispanic and ethnic packaged food products, the Company expects to have a portfolio of products that will not only include beverages. The main competitors of the Company include Goya Foods, Marquez Brothers International, Diaz Foods, La Fe Foods International, Grace Foods, as  well  as  other regional/ethnic food  distributors. HISP  will  focus on selecting brands of  all- natural packaged foods. Although some competitors are selling and distributing similar products, they use different packaging options and market foods that have high contents of artificial flavors, colors, and sweeteners as well high sodium contents. Additionally, our competitors import the majority of their distributed products, which are made with lower quality and price point raw materials. HISP will focus on distributing all-natural products as well as obtaining exclusive rights to brands that can be manufactured closer to its U.S. market base. HISP is committed to building long-term relationships with its consumers by offering superior, high quality products at the most competitive prices.      The packaged beverage market is highly competitive. Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition, ingredient sourcing, qualified personnel, distribution and product shelf space. As a developing company, a majority of our competitors are more established and better capitalized than HISP. The packaged beverage market is generally dominated by the largest beverage providers, including The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo, Inc. Many of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition and consumer confidence and are able to readily secure shelf space and media attention for their products. Many of our competitors also have existing relationships with the same distribution channels and retailers through which we sell our products. We intend to compete in the market by offering consumers affordable products that taste better and possess a longer shelf life than most products in the market.     17         
  
   Government Regulation         Packaged beverage and juice products are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As such, it is necessary for the Company to ensure its products distributed establish, maintain and make available for inspection, records and labels with nutrition information that meet legal food labeling requirements. The Company s products are manufactured by contracted production facilities that are subject to many regulations, including Food Facility Registration, recordkeeping, Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements, reporting, preventive controls and inspections.     Employees        As of August 31, 2016, the Company has 14 employees. Certain positions are being filled with paid independent contractors or insider owners who do not receive cash compensation but may receive stock compensation. The Company mitigates the need for a production staff by purchasing finished inventory. The Company has contracted with food brokers to represent Gran Nevada to retail stores nationally. In certain regions of the United States, we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies, which sell our products through their distribution channels. This can mitigate the need for a large sales and merchandising force. The Company also outsources its logistics to third-parties, which can reduce the need for employees in these roles.       Emerging     Growth  Company        The Company is an  emerging growth company , as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Stamps Act of 2012 ( JOBS Act ), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not  emerging growth companies  including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.     The Company has elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.       We will remain an  emerging growth company: until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion non-convertible debt in a three year period, (3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (4) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.      To the extent that we continue to qualify as a  smaller reporting company , as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirements to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years.      18         
  
   GOING CONCERN QUALIFICATION    Several conditions and events cast substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses of $1,027,259 and $25,812 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, has limited revenues and requires additional financing in order to finance its business activities on an ongoing basis. The Company s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including, but not limited to, continued progress in finding business opportunities.     At August 31, 2016, we had cash on hand of $115,783, and an accumulated deficit of $1,841,808. See  Liquidity and Capital Resources.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  AND ESTIMATES           The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, future events are subject to change, and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our balance sheet and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods, are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, restructurings, inventory and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.       Inflation       The amounts presented in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments.      LIQUIDITY AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES        During the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company received cash proceeds of $0 and $6,000, respectively, as a result of the Company s sale of common stock. The Company utilized these funds for operations.     In September 2015, the Company received $75,000, net of $12,500 in financing costs, under the terms of the Secured Convertible Promissory Note.      CASH FLOW        Our primary   source of liquidity has   been  cash  from  sales  of  shares  and  the issuance of a convertible promissory note .     19         
  
   WORKING  CAPITAL         As of August 31, 2016 the Company had total current assets of $630,209 and total current liabilities of $1,169,688 resulting in negative working capital of $539,479.

For the three months ended August 31, 2016, the cost of goods sold from the sale of the Company s ESD products was $420,169, or approximately 80% of sales      Operating Expenses      For the three months ended August 31, 2016, operating expenses were $723,754 (which included operating expenses incurred ESD from the acquisition date through August 31, 2016 which amounted to $95,319), an increase of $696,922 or approximately 2597% over operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2015 of $26,832.
