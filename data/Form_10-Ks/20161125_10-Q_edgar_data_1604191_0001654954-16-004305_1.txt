Item  1.        F inancial Statements  

In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim
periods presented. We have condensed such financial statements in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Therefore, such financial
statements do not include all disclosures required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Company has
evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or
disclosure through the date the consolidated financial statements
were issued by filing with the SEC. 

The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the entire fiscal year.

N ote 1 - The Company and Basis of
Presentation 

The Company 

AzurRx
BioPharma, Inc. ( AzurRx  or  Parent ) was
incorporated on January 30, 2014 in the State of Delaware. In June
2014, AzurRx acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of AzurRx BioPharma SAS (formerly ProteaBio Europe SAS), a
company incorporated in October 2008 under the laws of France that
had been a wholly-owned subsidiary of Protea Biosciences, Inc., or
Protea Sub, in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of Protea Biosciences
Group, Inc., a publicly-traded company. AzurRx and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, AzurRx Europe SAS, are collectively referred to as the
 Company.  

AzurRx,
through its AzurRx Europe SAS subsidiary, is engaged in the
research and development of non-systemic biologics for the
treatment of patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Non-systemic
biologics are non-absorbable drugs that act locally without
reaching the systemic circulation, i.e. the intestinal lumen, skin
or mucosa. The Company s current product pipeline consists of
two therapeutic proteins under development: 

MS1819
- a recombinant (synthetic) lipase, an enzyme derived from a
specialized yeast, which breaks apart fats. Lipases are required to
treat patients whose pancreases do not work anymore in a condition
known as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) which usually
arises from chronic pancreatitis (CP) or cystic fibrosis
(CF). 

AZ1101-
a recombinant (synthetic) enzyme which is being developed to
prevent hospital-acquired infections which come from resistant
bacterial strains caused by parenteral (intra-venous)
administration of b-lactam antibiotics, as well as prevention of
antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). 

Initial
Public Offering 

On  October
14, 2016, the Company completed an initial public offering
( IPO ) of 960,000 shares of common stock at a price of
$5.50 per share and received gross proceeds of $5,280,000. The
Company incurred total expenses of approximately $1,774,000 in
connection with the IPO, resulting in net offering proceeds of
$3,506,000. Concurrent with the IPO, (i) the Company issued
2,642,160 shares of common stock upon the mandatory conversion of
the convertible debt that results in interest expense of
approximately $254,000 from accelerated accretion, a beneficial
conversion feature charge resulting in interest expense of
approximately $6,423,000 and the elimination of the convertible
debt and warrant liability, (ii) the Company issued 717,540
warrants with a five-year life to certain OID noteholders in
exchange for their agreement not to sell their shares for 6 months
following the IPO with an exercise price equal to the IPO price
with an estimated value of approximately $3,028,000 that will be
charged to interest expense, and (iii) the grant of 48,000 warrants
with a five-year life to the underwriters at 120% of the IPO price
with an estimated value of approximately $197,000 that has no
effect on expenses or stockholders  equity. On November 18,
2016, the Company retired $362,786 of OID convertible debt and
accreted interest not mandatorily converted at the time of the IPO
that decreases cash and current liabilities by
$362,786 .  

Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S.
GAAP ). In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary to
present fairly our financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has
been derived from audited financial statements of that date. The
unaudited interim consolidated results of operations are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may occur for the full
fiscal year. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP have been omitted pursuant to instructions, rules, and
regulations prescribed by the SEC. We believe that the disclosures
provided herein are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading when these unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements are read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and notes previously dislosed in our Registration
Statement on Form S-1 filed in connection with the
IPO. 

The
financial statements include the accounts of AzurRx and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, AzurRx Europe SAS. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated upon
consolidation.

Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in
conformity with U.S. GAAP, and include certain estimates and
assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements (including
goodwill, intangible assets and contingent consideration), and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period, including contingencies. Accordingly, actual results may
differ from those estimates. 

Concentration of Risks 

Financial
instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash and available for sale
marketable securities. The Company primarily maintains its cash
balances with financial institutions in federally-insured accounts.
The Company may from time to time have cash in banks in excess of
FDIC insurance limits. The Company has not experienced any losses
to date resulting from this practice. 

At
December 31, 2015, the Company s investments in marketable
securities were comprised of a single investment in a publicly
traded stock received as payment from an investor for his $150,000
investment in the Company's original issue discounted convertible
notes. The investor agreed to make up any shortfall from sales of
these securities while any gain is for the account of the Company.
As of December 31, 2015, the market value of these marketable
securities was $56,850 and an associated Other Receivable of
$93,150 was recorded. On July 28, 2016, the investor paid $150,000
in cash and the securities were returned to the
investor. 

Prepaid Expenses 

All
direct costs of the proposed IPO offering are being capitalized and
included in Prepaid Expenses at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 in the amount of $982,377 and $345,968, respectively, which
were offset against additional paid-in capital upon the closing of
the IPO on October 14, 2016. 

Property, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements 

Property,
equipment and leasehold improvements are carried on the cost basis
and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets using the straight-line method. For financial statement
purposes, depreciation expense is provided using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as
follows: 

Laboratory
Equipment         5
years 

Computer
Equipment           5
years 

Office
Equipment           
     7-8 years 

Leasehold
Improvements     Term of lease or estimated useful
life of the assets; whichever is shorter 

Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while
renewals and betterments are capitalized.

Consolidated Financial Statements  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents
the excess of the purchase price of the acquired business over the
fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more
frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may be
present. Any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value
is charged to results of operations. The Company has not recognized
any impairment charges through September 30, 2016. 

Intangible
assets subject to amortization consist of in process research and
development and license agreements reported at the fair value at
date of the acquisition less accumulated amortization. Amortization
expense is provided using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 

In
Process Research   Development  12 years 

License
Agreements            
       
         5
years 

Research and Development 

Research and
development ("R D") costs are charged to operations when
incurred and are included in operating expenses. Research and
development costs consist principally of compensation of employees
and consultants that perform the Company s research
activities, the fees paid to maintain the Company s licenses,
and the payments to third parties for clinical trials and
additional product development and testing. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The
Company follows Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), which among other things,
defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset
and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring
or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing
the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement
that should be determined based on assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability. 

As a
basis for considering such assumptions, a three-tier fair value
hierarchy has been established, which prioritizes the inputs used
in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level
2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are
observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data,
which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions,
which reflect those that a market participant would
use. 

At
December 31, 2015, the Company had Level 2 instruments consisting
of marketable securities of common stock in a thinly-traded public
company received as payment from an investor for $150,000 of the
Company s original issue discounted convertible notes, see
Note 3 below. 

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had Level 3
instruments consisting of the Company s common stock warrant
liability related to the Company s convertible debt (see Note
10) and contingent consideration in connection with the Protea
Europe SAS acquisition (see Note 7). 

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial instruments,
including accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair
value due to their short maturities.

Consolidated Financial Statements  

The
following tables summarize the Company s financial
instruments measured at fair value on a recurring
basis: 

The
following table provides a reconciliation of the fair value of
liabilities using Level 3 significant unobservable
inputs: 

The
warrant liability above relates to the Company s original
issue discounted convertible notes, see Note 10 below. 

The
fair values of the outstanding warrants were measured using a
Binomial Option Pricing model. Inputs used to determine estimated
fair value of the warrant liabilities at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 include the estimated fair value of the
underlying stock at the valuation date ($5.13 and $2.16,
respectively), the estimated term in years of the warrants (4.59
and 4.90, respectively), risk-free interest rates (1.09% and 1.72%,
respectively), expected dividends (zero) and the expected
volatility (83% and 98%, respectively) of the underlying stock. The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement
of the warrant liabilities are the fair value of the underlying
stock at the valuation date and the estimated term of the warrants.
Generally, increases (decreases) in the fair value of the
underlying stock and estimated term would result in a directionally
similar impact to the fair value measurement. 

The contingent
consideration was valued by incorporating a series of Black-Scholes
Option Pricing Models ( BSM ) into a discounted cash
flow framework. Significant unobservable inputs used in this
calculation at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included
projected net sales over a 9-year period discounted by the
Company s weighted average cost of capital (30.0% and 33.7%,
respectively), the contractual hurdle amount of $100 million that
replaces the strike price input in the traditional BSM, asset
volatility (68% and 90%, respectively), that replaces the equity
volatility in the traditional BSM, risk-free rates (ranging from
0.9% to 1.6% and 1.5% to 2.7%, respectively), and an
option-adjusted spread (0.9% and 0.5%, respectively) that is
applied to these payments to account for the payer s risk and
arrive at a fair value of the expected payment.

The
fair value of the Company's other receivables, convertible debt,
and loans payable are as follows: 

The
fair value of Other Receivables approximates carrying value as
these consist primarily of French research and development
(R D) tax credits that are normally received within 9 months of
year end and amounts due from collaboration partner Mayoly, see
Note 14. 

The
fair value of Convertible Debt and Loans Payable approximates
carrying value due to the terms of such instruments and applicable
interest rates. 

Stock-based Compensation 

The
Company s board of directors and stockholders have adopted
and approved the Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Equity Incentive
Plan which took effect on May 12, 2014. Although the Company did
not grant any stock options under the Plan during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company will
account for its stock-based compensation awards to employees and
directors in accordance with ASC Topic 718,
Compensation Stock Compensation ("ASC 718"). ASC 718 requires
all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in the statements of operations
based on their grant date fair values. For stock options granted to
employees and to members of the board of directors for their
services on the board of directors, the Company estimates the grant
date fair value of each option award using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the
expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common
stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free
interest rates and expected dividend yields of the common stock.
For awards subject to service-based vesting conditions, the Company
recognizes stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated
forfeitures, equal to the grant date fair value of stock options on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The
Company will account for any stock-based payments to non-employees
in accordance with ASC Topic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to
Non-Employees ("ASC 505-50"). 

Income Taxes 

Income
taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for
Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), which provides for deferred taxes using
an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been included in the financial statements or
tax returns. The Company determines its deferred tax assets and
liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities, which are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are
provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is
more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

Table of Contents  

AzurRx BioPharma, Inc. 

Notes to Unadudited
Consolidated Financial Statements  

The
Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the
provisions of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the
Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent
that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The
determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than
not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax
position as well as consideration of the available facts and
circumstances. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Company does not have any significant uncertain tax positions. All
tax years are still open for audit. 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets 

The
Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for potential
impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and
Equipment ( ASC 360 ). Potential impairment is assessed
when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered.
Recoverability of these assets is assessed based on undiscounted
expected future cash flows from the assets, considering a number of
factors, including past operating results, budgets and economic
projections, market trends and product development cycles. If
impairments are identified, assets are written down to their
estimated fair value. The Company has not recognized any impairment
charges through September 30, 2016. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

For
foreign subsidiaries with operations denominated in a foreign
currency, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars,
which is the functional currency, at year-end exchange rates.
Income and expense items are translated at average rates of
exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses from
translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of
shareholders  deficit. 

Collaboration Agreements 

As more
fully discussed in Note 14, the Company has joint research
collaboration agreements with Laboratoires Mayoly Spindler SAS and
INRA TRANSFERT. Any payments due from the Company's collaboration
partners is recorded as a reduction in research and development
expenses. 

Subsequent Events 

The
Company considered events or transactions occurring after the
balance sheet date but prior to the date the consolidated financial
statements are available to be issued for potential recognition or
disclosure in its consolidated financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued an Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) which simplifies several aspects of the
accounting for share based payments, including the income tax
consequences and classification on the statement of cash flows.
Under the new standard, all excess tax benefits and deficiencies
will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income
statement. Additionally, excess tax benefits will be classified as
an operating activity on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is
effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The amendments requiring
recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the
income statement must be applied prospectively, and entities can
elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess
tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a
prospective or retrospective transition method. The Company is

adoption on our consolidated financial statements. 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which requires lessees to
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating
leases on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 using a
modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the
impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
November 2015, the FASB issued an ASU that requires all deferred
tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent on the
balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption permitted. In addition, this guidance can be applied
either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented.
The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the
impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial

In July
2015, the FASB issued an ASU modifying the accounting for
inventory. Under this ASU, the measurement principle for inventory
will change from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and
net realizable value. The ASU defines net realizable value as the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less
reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and
transportation. The ASU is applicable to inventory that is
accounted for under the first-in, first-out method and is effective
for reporting periods after December 15, 2016, with early adoption
permitted.   The
Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the
impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In May
2014, the FASB issued an ASU which supersedes the most current
revenue recognition requirements. The new revenue recognition
standard requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that
depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to be
entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance
is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual
periods after December 31, 2016. The Company is currently
evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on
our consolidated financial statements.

Note
9 - Convertible Promissory Notes 

Commencing on July
22, 2014 and through April 3, 2015, the Company, through a series
of transactions with various investors, raised $896,000 through the
sale of its convertible promissory notes with various maturity
dates that can be extended by the Company. The maturity dates
ranged from August 31, 2014 through May 31, 2015. All maturity
dates were extended by the Company. Through December 31, 2015, the
Company entered into transactions in which noteholders were
voluntarily repaid $761,000 and shares of common stock were issued
to such noteholders in lieu of interest payments. The notes bore
interest at 8% per annum and were convertible into common stock of
the Company at $6.45 per share at the investors  discretion
as long as the notes are outstanding. Notes outstanding at December
31, 2015, of $135,000 were converted on July 22, 2016 into original
issue discounted convertible notes, see Note 10,
below. 

On
August 7, 2015, 5,242 shares of the Company s common stock
were issued in payment of $33,790 of accrued interest payable on
these notes. Interest payable at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 in connection with these notes was $7,192 and $1,186,
respectively. 

Note
10 - Original Issue Discounted Convertible Notes 

Commencing on
October 10, 2014, the Company, through a series of transactions,
issued original issue discounted convertible notes to several
investors at 85% of the principal amount of the notes. The notes do
not otherwise bear interest. The notes are voluntarily convertible
into shares of the Company s common stock at the principal
amount divided by the conversion price, which is the lesser of
$6.45 per share or the per share price of the common stock
representing the pre-money valuation immediately prior to any
shares sold in the Company s IPO, multiplied by 80% (the
 Convertible Shares ). 

Under
the voluntary and mandatory features, the Company did not recognize
any amounts associated with the beneficial conversion feature at
the dates of issuances of these notes due to the unsatisfied
condition associated with the pre-money valuation. 

Additionally,
separate warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common
stock equal to 50% of the number of Convertible Shares at the
lesser of $7.37 per share or at a 20% discount to the pre-money IPO
valuation of the Company were issued in conjunction with these
notes. The warrants are exercisable for five years beginning six
months after the issue date. If the pre-money IPO valuation of the
Company is less than $43,750,000, then the number of Warrant Shares
(herein defined as the underlying common stock shares) will be
recalculated as follows: New Number of Warrant Shares = Existing
Warrant Shares * [43,750,000/(IPO valuation*80%)]. 

The
notes had nine-month terms with principal and interest due starting
July 10, 2015. The holders of the notes may demand payment in cash
before the maturity date within thirty (30) trading days of the
IPO. If, on the maturity date, the principal amount of any note
remains unpaid, the Company shall pay to the note holder a one-time
default penalty of 5% of the total amount unpaid on the maturity
date. The Company, however, shall still be required to repay the
note holder the principal balance and interest on the principal
balance, which shall accrue at the default interest rate equal to
the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under
applicable law. As of December 31, 2015, $2,105,882 in principal
amount of these notes are in default due to being past their
maturity dates.

On
March 31, 2016, the holders of all but $300,000 in principal signed
exchange agreements nullifying the default provisions and rolling
the principal amount into new original issue discounted convertible
notes at 92% of the principal amount of the notes due on November
4, 2016, modifying the conversion price to $4.65 per share, and
modifying the exercise price of the warrants down to the lesser of
(i) $5.58 or (ii) a 15% premium to the price per share or unit
issued in the IPO or in connection with a public listing. The notes
are voluntarily convertible into that number of shares of common
stock as is equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes
plus any accrued but unpaid interest divided by $4.65. $2,094,000
in gross proceeds were received in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 in additional original issue discounted convertible notes
under the same terms. On July 22, 2016, $135,000 of convertible
promissory notes were converted into original issue discounted
convertible notes under the same terms. 

Under
the mandatory conversion feature, upon the consummation of the
Company s IPO at a pre-money valuation of at least
$50,000,000 immediately prior to the IPO or the date the Company
obtains a public listing (through a reverse merger, self-listing or
other alternative means), the aggregate principal amounts of the
notes plus any accrued but unpaid interest shall be automatically
converted into that number of shares of common stock equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the notes plus any accrued but unpaid
interest multiplied by 1.25 divided by the lesser of $4.65 or the
price per share issued in the IPO, or in the event of a public
listing, the price per share issued by the Company in connection
with such transaction. In the event the Company (i) pays a stock
dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable
in shares of common stock on shares of common stock or any common
stock equivalents, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of common
stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by
way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of common stock
into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues, in the event of a
reclassification of shares of the common stock, any shares of
capital stock of the Company, then the conversion price shall be
adjusted by multiplying the conversion price by a fraction of which
the numerator shall be the number of shares of common stock
(excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding
immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall
be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately
after such event. As long as at least 33% of the aggregate
principal amount of the notes issued remains outstanding, the
Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly: a) amend its charter documents, including,
without limitation, its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in
any manner that materially and adversely affects any rights of the
holders; b) pay cash dividends or distributions on any equity
securities of the Company; c) enter into any transaction with any
affiliate of the Company which would be required to be disclosed in
any public filing with the SEC, unless such transaction is made on
an arm s-length basis and expressly approved by a majority of
the disinterested directors of the Company (even if less than a
quorum otherwise required for board approval); or d) enter into any
agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. As a result of
these exchange agreements, as of December 31, 2015, the Company has
not recorded any of the default provisions for all but $300,000 in
principal of these notes. The aggregate gross proceeds received in
connection with these notes through September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 was $9,297,529 and $6,145,000, respectively. 

The
Company determined that there was a beneficial conversion feature
on the voluntary conversion feature in the amount of $36,670 at the
dates of issuances on certain of these notes issued through
September 30, 2016. Under the mandatory conversion feature, all of
the unamortized discount remaining at the date of conversion shall
be recognized immediately at that date as interest
expense. 

The Company
accounted for the warrant feature of the notes based upon the fair
value of the warrants on the date of issuance. The effect of the
warrant modifications is reflected in the fair value adjustment at
September 30, 2016 noted below. The Company recorded a warrant
liability related to the warrants at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 of $1,719,502 and $1,205,687, respectively, at
the dates of issuance. The warrant liability was adjusted to the
fair value at September 30, 2016 of $3,214,973 by recording a fair
value adjustment of $285,271 and $1,873,311, respectively, in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The warrant
liability was adjusted to the fair value at September 30, 2015 by
recording a fair value adjustment of ($55,586) and ($38,641),
respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015.   

For the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
recorded $724,246 and $516,198, respectively, of interest expense
related to the original issue discount and warrant features of
these notes. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, $413,462 and $245,065, respectively, of these amounts were
accreted interest expense related to the original issue discount
feature of the notes that also increased the outstanding balance of
the convertible debt by the same amount. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, $310,784 and $271,133, respectively,
of these amounts was amortization of the debt discount related to
the warrant features of the convertible debt.

respectively, from Mayoly under this agreement. 

The Agreement
grants the Predecessor the right to cure any breach by Mayoly of
its obligations under the INRA agreement. In connection with the
Acquisition, the Predecessor, with the consent of INRA and CNRS,
assigned all of its rights, title and interest in and to the 2014

CNRS, entered into a Usage and Cross-Licensing Agreement granting
Mayoly exclusive worldwide rights to exploit Yarrowia lipolytica
and other lipase proteins based on their patents for use in humans.
The INRA Agreement provides for the payment by Mayoly of royalties
on net sales, subject to Mayoly s right to terminate such
obligation upon the payment of a lump sum specified in the
agreement. 

Employment Agreement 

On
January 3, 2016, the Company entered into an employment agreement
with its President and Chief Executive Officer, Johan Spoor. The
employment agreement provides for a term expiring January 2, 2019.
Either party may terminate Mr. Spoor s employment at any time
and for any reason, or for no reason. During the term and for a
period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Mr. Spoor shall not engage
in competition with the Company either directly or indirectly, in
any manner or capacity. 

The Company will
pay Mr. Spoor a base salary of $350,000 per year, which shall
automatically increase to $425,000 upon (i) consummation of the IPO
which results in the listing of the Company s common stock on
The NASDAQ Stock Market or NYSE MKT (which occurred on October 11,
2016), or (ii) consummation of a merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into any other corporation or corporations, or a
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or
the effectuation by the Company of a transaction or series of
related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting shares of
the Company is disposed of or conveyed, and in each such case the
Company becomes a public reporting company which results in the
listing of the Company s shares (or shares of the
Company s parent company) on The NASDAQ Stock Market or NYSE
MKT (the  Public Event ) (which occurred on October 11,
2016). At the sole discretion of the board of directors or the
compensation committee of the board, following each calendar year
of employment, Mr. Spoor shall be eligible to receive an additional
cash bonus based on his attainment of certain financial, clinical
development, and/or business milestones to be established annually
by the board of directors or the compensation
committee.

In
addition, Mr. Spoor shall be issued 100,000 shares of restricted
common stock, which vest as follows: (i) 50,000 restricted shares
upon the first commercial sale in the United States of MS1819, and
(ii) 50,000 restricted shares upon the total market capitalization
of the Company exceeding $1 billion dollars for 20 consecutive
trading days, in each case subject to the earlier determination of
a majority of the board of directors. In the event of a Change of
Control (as defined in the agreement), all of the restricted shares
shall vest in full. The estimated fair value at the date of grant
was $216,000. 

Mr.
Spoor shall also be issued 380,000 10-year stock options pursuant
to the 2014 Plan, which options shall vest as follows so long as
Mr. Spoor is serving as Chief Executive Officer or President at
such time: (i) 100,000 of such stock options shall vest upon
consummation of the IPO, (ii) 50,000 of such stock options shall
vest upon the Company initiating a Phase II clinical trial in the
United States for MS1819 (i.e., upon the first individual enrolled
in the trial), (iii) 50,000 of such stock options shall vest upon
the Company completing a Phase II clinical trial in the United
States for MS1819, (iv) 100,000 of such stock options shall vest
upon the Company initiating a Phase III clinical trial in the
United States for MS1819, (v) 50,000 of such stock options shall
vest upon the Company initiating a Phase I clinical trial in the
United States for any product other than MS1819, and (vi) 30,000 of
such stock options shall vest upon the determination of a majority
of the board of directors. 

On June
8, 2016, the board of directors clarified Mr. Spoor s
agreement as follows: the 380,000 options described have neither
been granted nor priced since certain key provisions, particularly
the underlying exercise price, have not been determined. The
options will be granted at a future date to be determined by the
board of directors, and the options will be priced at that future
date when they are granted. As of September 30, 2016, no options
have been granted. 

If the
Company terminates Mr. Spoor s employment other than for
cause, or he terminates for good reason, as both terms are defined
in the agreement, the Company will pay him twelve (12) months of
his base salary as severance. If the Company terminates Mr.
Spoor s employment other than for cause, or he terminates for
good reason, in connection with a Change of Control, the Company
will pay him eighteen (18) months of his base salary in lump sum as
severance.  

Note
15 - Income Taxes 

The
Company is subject to taxation at the federal level in both the
United States and France and at the state level in the United
States. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
had gross deferred tax assets of approximately $3,801,000 and
$2,412,000, respectively. As the Company cannot determine that it
is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit
of the deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance of approximately
$3,801,000 and $2,412,000, respectively, has been established at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The
significant components of the Company s net deferred tax
assets (liabilities) consisted of:

Notes to Unadudited
Consolidated Financial Statements  

Income
taxes computed using the federal statutory income tax rate differs
from the Company s effective tax rate primarily due to the
following: 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company has gross net operating loss
carry-forwards for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes of
approximately $8,391,000 and $8,388,000, respectively, which expire
in the year 2036. The net increase in the valuation allowance for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately
$1,389,000. 

At
December 31, 2015, the Company had gross net operating loss
carry-forwards for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes of
approximately $5,325,000 and $5,322,000, respectively, which expire
in the year 2035. The net increase in the valuation allowance for
the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately
$1,767,000. 

The
Company has a French subsidiary whose operations are not taxed in
the United States and this is not considered in the tax provision.
At December 31, 2015, the Company has approximately $5,052,000 in
net operating losses which it can carryforward indefinitely to
offset against future French income. 

ASC 740
prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740
also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
transition. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Company had taken no uncertain tax positions that would require
disclosure under ASC 740. 

Note
16 - Net Loss per Common Share 

Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect,
in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the impact of
common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants
and conversion of convertible debt that are not deemed to be
anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of the outstanding stock options
and warrants is computed using the treasury stock
method. 

For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, diluted net loss
per share did not include the effect of 1,092,800 shares of common
stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and
2,160,239 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of
convertible debt as their effect would be
anti-dilutive. 

For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, diluted net loss
per share did not include the effect of 661,562 shares of common
stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants; 1,118,973
shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of promissory
notes and convertible debt; and 2,439,365 shares of common stock
issuable upon the conversion of the Series A, as their effect would
be anti-dilutive.

On
August 31, 2014, January 31, 2015, February 28, 2015 and May 31,
2015, the Company issued promissory notes to Matthew Balk and his
affiliates in the aggregate principal amount of $236,000. These
notes have been repaid in full as to $50,000 on November 11, 2014,
$111,000 on April 3, 2015, and $75,000 on August 7, 2015. Mr. Balk
holds voting and dispositive power over the shares held by Pelican
Partners LLC, which owns 30%, 47%, and 64%, respectively, of the
outstanding common stock of the Company as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

From
October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the Company used the
services of Edward Borkowski, a member of the board of directors
and the chairman of the Company s audit committee, as a

related travel expenses. On October 14, 2014 and March 12, 2015,
the Company issued original issue discounted convertible notes to
Mr. Borkowski, in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000. The
notes will automatically convert into shares of the Company s
common stock upon the consummation of the IPO at a conversion price
equal to the principal amount divided by the lesser of $6.45 per
share or the per share price of the Company s common stock in
the IPO, multiplied by 80%. Mr. Borkowski has signed an exchange
agreement related to these notes as detailed in Note 10
above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from
operations since our inception. As of September 30, 2016, we had
sustained cumulative losses attributable to common stockholders of
approximately $17,256,000. At September 30, 2016, we had cash of
approximately $128,502. 

We have funded our operations to date primarily through the
issuance of debt and convertible debt securities. We have funded
our working capital requirements with the proceeds of short-term 8%
convertible promissory notes and original issue discounted
convertible notes (the  OID Notes ). 

Through September 30, 2016, we had received aggregate gross
proceeds of $896,000 from the issuance of convertible promissory
notes, $761,000 of which had been repaid, and $135,000 that was
converted into OID Notes on July 22, 2016. Payment of $33,790 of
accrued interest on the $761,000 principal amount of convertible
promissory notes repaid was made through the issuance of an
aggregate of 5,242 shares of common stock. 

Through September 30, 2016, we have received aggregate gross
proceeds of $9,297,529 from the issuance of $10,128,836 principal
amount of OID Notes. 

On October 14, 2016, we completed the IPO of 960,000 shares of
common stock at an initial public offering price of $5.50 per share
and received gross proceeds of $5,280,000. We incurred total
expenses of approximately $1,774,000 in connection with the IPO,
resulting in net offering proceeds of $3,506,000. 

We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable
future for the development of our product candidates. We will
require additional financing to develop, prepare regulatory filings
and obtain regulatory approvals, fund operating losses, and, if
deemed appropriate, establish manufacturing, sales and marketing
capabilities.

Table of Contents  

We are focused on expanding our product pipeline through
collaborations, and also through acquisitions of products and
companies. We are continually evaluating potential asset
acquisitions and business combinations. To finance such
acquisitions, we might raise additional equity capital, incur
additional debt, or both. 

Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $2,517,950, which primarily reflected our
net loss of $8,960,139 plus non-cash depreciation and amortization
expense of $555,421, non-cash fair value adjustment of the warrants
liability of $1,873,311, non-cash fair value adjustment of the
contingent consideration of $900,000, non-cash warrant expense of
$55,097, non-cash accreted interest on OID Notes and debt discount
- warrants of $1,820,604, a decrease in other receivables of
$908,667 due to the collection of the French R D tax credit and
the settling of amounts owed from an investor in the OID Notes, and
an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $960,863
due to our cash position, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses
of $628,256 consisting primarily of finance and legal costs
associated with the IPO. Net cash used in operating activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,453,098, which
primarily reflected our net loss of $5,264,028 plus non-cash
depreciation and amortization expense of $550,338, non-cash warrant
expense of $216,441, non-cash accreted interest on OID Notes and
debt discount - warrants of $917,589, an increase in accounts
payable and accrued expenses of $60,058 due to our cash position,
an increase in other receivables of $290,472 due to amounts due
from our research partners offset by an increase in prepaid
expenses of $203,511 consisting primarily of finance and legal
costs associated with the IPO. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $13,140 which consisted of the purchase of
property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $19,896, which
consisted of the purchase of property and equipment. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $2,094,000, which consisted of the gross
proceeds in connection with the issuance of the OID Notes. Net cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 was $4,989,000, which consisted of the issuance
of convertible promissory notes of $445,000 and the gross proceeds
in connection with the issuance of the OID Notes of $5,345,000
offset by the repayment of promissory notes of
$801,000. 

Consolidated Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

R D expenses were $744,309 and $363,996, respectively, for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, an increase of
$380,313. R D expenses were $2,270,546 and $1,734,484,
respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, an increase of $536,062. The increase in R D is primarily
due to costs associated with manufacturing additional batches of
MS1819. We expect R D expenses to increase in future periods as
our product candidates continue through clinical trials and we seek
strategic collaborations. 

G A expenses were $543,721 and $1,044,968, respectively, for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a decrease of
$501,247. G A expenses were $2,089,672 and $2,625,513,
respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, a decrease of $535,841. The decrease was due primarily to a
decrease in consulting fees. We expect G A expenses to increase
going forward as we proceed to advance our product candidates
through the development and regulatory process. 

Fair value adjustment of our contingent consideration increased
$900,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due
primarily to lower risk of achieving sales projections as
demonstrated by a decrease in the weighted average cost of capital
relative to the prior valuation. No such fair value adjustment of
our consideration was recorded in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015.   

Interest expense was $724,867 and $520,551, respectively, for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, an increase of
$204,316. Interest expense was $1,826,610 and $942,672,
respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, an increase of $883,938. The increase is due to the higher
level of outstanding OID Notes. Fair value adjustment of our
warrants was ($285,271) and $55,586, respectively, for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, an increase of $340,857.
Fair value adjustment of our warrants was ($1,873,311) and $38,641,
respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, an increase of $1,911,952. The increase was due to the higher
amount of outstanding OID Notes as well as the warrants having a
greater value at September 30, 2016 than at September 30,
2015.

Use of Proceeds 

Our IPO
was effected through a Registration Statement on Form S-1, as
amended (Registration No. 333-212511), that was declared effective
by the SEC on October 11, 2016 and completed on October 14, 2016,
which registered 960,000 shares of our common stock at an offering
price of $5.50 per share. We received gross proceeds of $5,280,000.
The IPO was underwritten and co-managed by WallachBeth Capital, LLC
and Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc., as representatives of the
several underwriters. We paid to the underwriters underwriting
commissions and a non-accountable expense allowance totaling
$580,800. In addition, we incurred expenses of approximately
$1,193,000, which when added to the underwriting commissions and
non-accountable expense allowance paid by us, amount to total
expenses of approximately $1,774,000. Thus, the net offering
proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting commissions,
non-accountable expense allowance and offering expenses payable by
us, were approximately $3,506,000. No offering expenses were paid
directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or
their associates) or persons owning ten percent or more of any
class of our equity securities or to any other affiliates. We have
placed the unused proceeds from the IPO in a non-interest bearing
checking account.

designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such

registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
period in which this report is being prepared; 

b) 

designed such internal control over financial reporting, caused

report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the registrant s internal control over
financial reporting; and 

5. 

The registrant s other certifying officer and I have
disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and
the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors
(or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

a) 

all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; and 

b) 

any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the
registrant s internal control over financial
reporting.
