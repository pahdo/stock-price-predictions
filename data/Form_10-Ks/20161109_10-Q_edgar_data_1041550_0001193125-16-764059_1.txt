     NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    (1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION    HopFed
Bancorp, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed at the direction of Heritage Bank USA Inc., formerly Hopkinsville Federal Savings Bank (the  Bank ), to become the holding company of the Bank upon the conversion of the Bank from a
federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank. The conversion was consummated on February 6, 1998. The Company s primary assets are the outstanding capital stock of the converted Bank, and its sole
business is that of the converted Bank.    On June 5, 2013, the Bank s legal name became Heritage Bank USA Inc. and the Bank was
granted a commercial bank charter by the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions ( KDFI ). On June 5, 2013, the Bank became subject to regulation by the KDFI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). On
the same day, HopFed Bancorp was granted a bank holding company charter by the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis ( FED ) and as such regulated by the FED.  
 The Bank operates a mortgage division, Heritage Mortgage Services, in Clarksville, Tennessee with agents located in several of its markets.
The Bank has a financial services division, Heritage Solutions, with offices in Murray, Kentucky, Kingston Springs, Tennessee, and Pleasant View, Tennessee. Heritage Solutions agents travel throughout western Kentucky and middle Tennessee offering
fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds and brokerage services. In October of 2014, the Bank opened a loan production office in Nashville, Tennessee. In October 2016, the Bank opened a loan production office in Brentwood, Tennessee, that will be
used our commercial loan officers and Heritage Mortgage Services.    The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted ( GAAP ) in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) necessary for fair representation have been included. The
results of operations and other data for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.  
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company s
December 31, 2015, Consolidated Financial Statements.

  (2) INCOME PER SHARE  
 The following schedule reconciles the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted income per share ( IPS ) computations for
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, the Company s financial statements reflect a liability
adequate to release 32,226 and 37,063 shares, respectively, from the HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the  ESOP ). Therefore, the Company has included 32,226 and 37,063 shares held by the ESOP in the IPS calculation
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, the Company has excluded all unearned
shares held by the ESOP.

  (3) STOCK COMPENSATION  
 The Company incurred compensation cost related to the HopFed Bancorp, Inc. 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan of $27,000 and $105,000 for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and $46,000 and $144,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company issued 856 and 12,342 shares of restricted stock during the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016. The Company issued 1,263 and 2,034 shares of restricted stock during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The table below provides a detail of the Company s
future compensation expense related to restricted stock vesting at September 30, 2016:      
   The compensation committee may make additional awards of restricted stock, thereby increasing the future
expense related to this plan. In addition, award vesting may be accelerated due to certain events as outlined in the restricted stock award agreement. Any acceleration of vesting will change the timing of, but not the aggregate amount of,
compensation expense incurred.

  (4) SECURITIES  
 Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market
concerns warrant such evaluations. Consideration is given to (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent
and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Company has 24 securities with unrealized losses. The carrying amount of securities and their estimated fair
values at September 30, 2016, were as follows:

  The allowance for loan losses totaled $6.8 million at September 30, 2016, $5.7 million at
December 31, 2015, and $5.5 million at September 30, 2015, respectively. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.16% at September 30, 2016, 1.01% at December 31, 2015, and 0.97% at September 30, 2015.

Table of Contents  

  The following table presents the balance in the allowance for loan losses and the recorded
investment in loans as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, by portfolio segment and based on the impairment method as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015.

Table of Contents  

  All loans listed as 30-89 days past due and non-accrual are not performing as agreed. Loans
listed as special mentioned, substandard and doubtful are paying as agreed. However, the customer s financial statements may indicate weaknesses in their current cash flow, the customer s industry may be in decline due to current economic
conditions, collateral values used to secure the loan may be declining, or the Company may be concerned about the customer s future business prospects.  
 The Company does not originate loans it considers sub-prime and is not aware of any exposure to the additional credit concerns associated with
sub-prime lending in either the Company s loan or investment portfolios. The Company does have a significant amount of construction and land development loans. Management reports to the Company s Board of Directors on the status of the
Company s specific construction and development loans as well as the market trends in those markets in which the Company actively participates.  
 The Company s annualized net charge off ratios for nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015, and
the year ended December 31, 2015, was 0.02%, 0.37% and 0.29%, respectively. The ratios of allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans at September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, were 58.40%, 76.70%,
and 76.80%, respectively.    The determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on management s analysis, performed on a
quarterly basis. Various factors are considered, including the market value of the underlying collateral, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to outstanding loans, historical loss
experience, delinquency trends and prevailing economic conditions. Although management believes its allowance for loan losses is adequate, there can be no assurance that additional allowances will not be required or that losses on loans will not be
incurred.    The Company conducts annual reviews on all loan relationships above one million to ascertain the borrowers continued ability to
service their debt as agreed. In addition to the credit relationships mentioned above, management may classify any credit relationship once it becomes aware of adverse credit trends for that customer. Typically, the annual review consists of updated
financial statements for borrowers and any guarantors, a review of the borrower s credit history with the Company and other creditors, and current income tax information.  
 As a result of this review, management will classify loans based on their credit risk. Additionally, the Company provides a risk grade for all
loans past due more than ninety days. The Company uses the following risk definitions for commercial loan risk grades:     Excellent -
 Loans in this category are to persons or entities of unquestioned financial strength, a highly liquid financial position, with collateral that is liquid and well margined. These borrowers have performed without question on past obligations, and
the bank expects their performance to continue. Internally generated cash flow covers current maturities of long-term debt by a substantial margin. Loans secured by bank certificates of deposit and savings accounts, with appropriate holds placed on
the accounts, are to be rated in this category.  
      22  

Table of Contents  

   Very Good -  These are loans to persons or entities with strong financial condition and
above- average liquidity who have previously satisfactorily handled their obligations with the bank. Collateral securing the bank s debt is margined in accordance with policy guidelines. Internally generated cash flow covers current maturities
of long-term debt more than adequately. Unsecured loans to individuals supported by strong financial statements and on which repayment is satisfactory may be included in this classification.  
  Satisfactory -  Assets of this grade conform to substantially all the Bank s underwriting criteria and evidence an average level of
credit risk; however, such assets display more susceptibility to economic, technological or political changes since they lack the above average financial strength of credits rated Very Good. Borrower s repayment capacity is considered to be
adequate. Credit is appropriately structured and serviced; payment history is satisfactory.     Acceptable -  Assets of this grade
conform to most of the Bank s underwriting criteria and evidence an acceptable, though higher than average, level of credit risk; however, these loans have certain risk characteristics which could adversely affect the borrower s ability to
repay given material adverse trends. Loans in this category require an above average level of servicing and show more reliance on collateral and guaranties to preclude a loss to the Bank should material adverse trends develop. If the borrower is a
company, its earnings, liquidity and capitalization are slightly below average when compared to its peers.     Watch -  These loans are
characterized by borrowers who have marginal cash flow, marginal profitability, or have experienced an unprofitable year and a declining financial condition. The borrower has in the past satisfactorily handled debts with the bank, but in recent
months has either been late, delinquent in making payments, or made sporadic payments. While the bank continues to be adequately secured, margins have decreased or are decreasing, despite the borrower s continued satisfactory condition. Other
characteristics of borrowers in this class include inadequate credit information, weakness of financial statement and repayment capacity, but with collateral that appears to limit exposure. This classification includes loans to established borrowers
that are reasonably margined by collateral, but where potential for improvement in financial capacity appears limited.     Special Mention
-  Loans in this category have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deteriorating prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position
at some future date. Borrowers may be experiencing adverse operating trends or market conditions. Non- financial reasons for rating a credit exposure Special Mention include, but are not limited to: management problems, pending litigations,
ineffective loan agreement and/or inadequate loan documentation, structural weaknesses and/or lack of control over collateral.  
      23  

Table of Contents  

   Substandard -  A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth or
paying capacity of the debtor or the collateral pledged. There exists one or more well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. There is a distinct possibility the Bank will experience some loss if the deficiencies are not
corrected. Generally, the asset is considered collectible as to both principal and interest primarily because of collateral coverage or enterprise value. Generally, the asset is current and marginally secured.  
  Doubtful -  A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified as substandard, with the added
characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. These are poor quality loans in which neither the collateral, if any,
nor the financial condition of the borrower presently ensure collectability in full in a reasonable period of time; in fact, there is permanent impairment in the collateral securing the bank s loan. These loans are in a work-out status and have
a defined work-out strategy.     Loss  - Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their
continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. The bank takes losses in the period in which they become uncollectible.    The following
credit risk standards are assigned to consumer loans.     Satisfactory -  All consumer open-end and closed-end retail loans shall have
an initial risk grade assigned of 3 - Satisfactory.     Substandard Assets -  All consumer open-end and closed-end retail loans past
due 90 cumulative days from the contractual date will be classified as 7 - Substandard. If a consumer/retail loan customer files bankruptcy, the loan will be classified as 7 - Substandard regardless of payment history.  
  Loss Assets -  All closed-end retail loans that become past due 120 cumulative days and open-end retail loans that become past due 180
cumulative days from the contractual due date will be charged off as loss assets. The charge off will be taken by the end of the month in which the 120-day or 180-day time period elapses. All losses in retail credit will be recognized when the
affiliate becomes aware of the loss, but in no case should the charge off exceed the time frames stated within this policy.    A loan is
considered to be impaired when management determines that it is possible that the Company will be unable to collect all principal and interest payments due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The value of individually
impaired loans is measured based on the present value of expected payments or using the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. Currently, it is management s practice to classify all substandard or
doubtful loans as impaired.

  On a periodic basis, the Bank may modify the terms of certain loans. In evaluating whether a
restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR), Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Accounting Standards Update 310 (ASU 310),  A Creditor s Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring.
 In evaluating whether a restructuring constitutes a TDR, the Bank must separately conclude that both of the following exist:      

The restructuring constitutes a concession        

The debtor is experiencing financial difficulties      ASU 310 provides the following guidance for
the Bank s evaluation of whether it has granted a concession as follows:      

If a debtor does not otherwise have access to funds at a market interest rate for debt with similar risk characteristics as the restructured debt, the restructured debt would be considered a below market rate, which may
indicate that the Bank may have granted a concession. In that circumstance, the Bank should consider all aspects of the restructuring in determining whether it has granted a concession, the creditor must make a separate assessment about whether the
debtor is experiencing financial difficulties to determine whether the restructuring constitutes a TDR.        

A temporary or permanent increase in the interest rate on a loan as a result of a restructuring does not eliminate the possibility of the restructuring from being considered a concession if the new interest rate on the
loan is below the market interest rate for loans of similar risk characteristics.        

A restructuring that results in a delay in payment that is insignificant is not a concession. However, the Bank must consider a variety of factors in assessing whether a restructuring resulting in a delay in payment is
insignificant.      At December 31, 2015, the Company had eight loans, representing two lending relationships, classified
as performing TDR s. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company added four loans to TDR status, representing one additional lending relationship, as a performing TDR. The loans added to TDR classification are paying
interest only for one year while the customer attempts to sell the collateral. A summary of the activity in loans classified as TDRs for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, is as follows:

   (6) NON-PERFORMING ASSETS  
 The Company s real estate and other assets owned represent properties and personal collateral acquired through customer loan defaults. The
property is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell and carrying cost at the date acquired. Any difference between the book value and estimated market value is recognized as a charge off through the allowance for loan
loss account. Additional real estate owned and other asset losses may be determined on individual properties at specific intervals or at the time of disposal. In general, the Company will obtain a new appraisal on all real estate owned with a book
balance in excess of $250,000 on an annual basis. Additional losses are recognized as a non-interest expense.    At September 30,
2016, December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, the Company had balances in other real estate and assets owned and non-accrual loans consisting of the following:

  (8) FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  
   In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820-10 , Fair Value Measurements.  This Statement defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value. The statement establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring
fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.         

Level 1 is for assets and liabilities that management has obtained quoted prices (unadjusted for transaction cost) or identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access as of
the measurement date.        

Level 2 is for assets and liabilities in which significant unobservable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.        

Level 3 is for assets and liabilities in which significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability.      The fair values of securities available for sale are determined by a matrix pricing, which is a mathematical
technique that is widely used in the industry to value debt securities without exclusively using quoted prices for the individual securities in the Company s portfolio but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark
quoted securities. Impaired loans are valued at the net present value of expected payments using the fair value of any assigned collateral. The values for bank owned life insurance are obtained from stated values from the respective insurance
companies. The liability associated with the Company s derivative is obtained from a quoted value supplied by our correspondent banker. The value of real estate owned is obtained from appraisals completed on properties at the time of
acquisition and annually thereafter.

  The table below includes a roll-forward of the consolidated condensed statement of financial
condition items for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, (including the change in fair value) for assets and liabilities classified by HopFed Bancorp, Inc. within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy for
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. When a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable
factors to the overall fair value measurement. However, since level 3 assets and liabilities typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources), the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.

   (9) EFFECT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
 ASU 2015-01,   Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)   Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by
Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.   ASU 2015-01 eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items, which, among other things, required an entity to segregate extraordinary items considered to be unusual and
infrequent from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. ASU 2015-01 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016, though early
adoption was permitted. The implementation of ASU 2015-01 did not have a significant impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 ASU No. 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   This ASU affects reporting entities that are required to
evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments: (1) Modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting
interest entities; (2) Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (3) Affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee
arrangements and related party relationships; and (4) Provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that
are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU No. 2015-02 was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The provisions of ASU
No. 2015-02 did not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

   ASU 2015-05,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic
350-40)   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.   ASU 2015-05 addresses accounting for fees paid by a customer in cloud computing arrangements such as (i) software as a service,
(ii) platform as a service, (iii) infrastructure as a service and (iv) other similar hosting arrangements. ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud
computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a
software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 was effective on January 1, 2016, and did not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  ASU 2015-15,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance
Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting.   ASU 2015-15 adds SEC paragraphs pursuant to an SEC Staff Announcement that given the absence
of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the
deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-15 did not have a significant impact on the Company s
Consolidated Financial Statements.    In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16 , Simplifying the
Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.  The guidance in this update eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a
measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new guidance is intended to reduce complexity in financial reporting. The elimination of the
restatement requirement should simplify financial reporting for many entities. However, recognizing the entire impact of a measurement period adjustment in a single reporting period may introduce earnings volatility and reduce comparability between
periods when the adjustments are material. The accounting changes in this update are effective for public companies for annual periods, and the interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application
was permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The implementation of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  ASU 2016-1,  No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities.  ASU 2016-1, among other things, (i) requires equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) simplifies the impairment
assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, (iii) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant
assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, (iv) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair
value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, (v) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the
instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments,  
      38  

Table of Contents  

  (vi) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement
category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and (viii) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to
available-for-sale. ASU 2016-1 will be effective on January 1, 2018, and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.  
 On June 16, 2016, the FASB released its finalized ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326):
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The amendments to U.S. GAAP require businesses and other organization to measure the expected credit losses on financial assets, such as loans, securities, bond insurance, and many
receivables, the FASB said. The accounting changes apply to instruments recorded on balance sheets at their historical cost, although there are some limited changes to the accounting for debt instruments classified as available-for-sale. The
accounting board added that the write-downs will be based on historical information, current business conditions, and forecasts, and it expects the forecasts to improve the loss estimates on financial assets that are losing value. The board also
said the techniques that are employed today to write down loans and other instruments can still be used, although it expects the variables for calculating the losses to change. ASU 2016-13 will become effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Companies are permitted to adopt ASU 2016-13 in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company has not made a determination as
to how the implementation of ASU 2016-13 will affect the Company s consolidated financial statements.     ASU 2016-02 ,   Leases (Topic
842) .  ASU 2016-02 will, among other things, require lessees to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is
an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made
to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2016-02 will be effective for us on January 1, 2019 and will require transition using a
modified retrospective approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on our financial
statements.     ASU 2016-05    Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting
Relationships .  ASU 2016-05  clarifies  that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under ASC Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that
hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. ASU 2016-05 will be effective for us on January 1, 2017, and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.

   ASU 2016-07,  Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition
to the Equity Method of Accounting .  The amendments affect all entities that have an investment that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence.
ASU 2016-07 simplifies the transition to the equity method of accounting by eliminating retroactive adjustment of the investment when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method, among other things. ASU 2016-07 will be effective for us on
January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.     ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   Under ASU 2016-09 all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit
in the income statement during the period in which they occur. Previously, such amounts were recorded in the pool of excess tax benefits included in additional paid-in capital, if such pool was available. Because excess tax benefits are no longer
recognized in additional paid-in capital, the assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing earnings per share should exclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have previously been recognized in additional
paid-in capital. Additionally, excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity rather than a financing activity, as was previously the case. ASU 2016-09 also provides that an entity can make
an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 changes the threshold to qualify for equity classification (rather
than as a liability) to permit withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates (rather than the minimum as was previously the case) in the applicable jurisdictions. ASU 2016-09 will be effective on January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have
a significant impact on our financial statements.    ASU 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   ( ASU 2016-15 ) is
intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted with retrospective application. We are evaluating the impact adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
 Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

  (10) INCOME TAXES  
 The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns and Tennessee excise tax returns. The Company and its non-bank
subsidiaries filed consolidated Kentucky income tax returns. The Bank is exempt from Kentucky corporate income tax. The Company has no unrecognized tax benefits and has accrued any interest or penalties for uncertain tax positions. The effective tax
rate differs from the statutory federal rate of 34% and Tennessee excise rate of 6.50% due to investments in qualified municipal securities; bank owned life insurance, income apportioned to Kentucky and certain non-deductible expenses.  
 (11) OTHER ASSETS    The Company has invested in
two flow-through limited liability entities that manage and invest in affordable housing projects that qualify for historic, low-income and elderly housing tax credits. At September 30, 2016, the Company s total investment in each entity
was $39,250 and $923,000, respectively. The Company has no future capital commitments to either entity. The amounts recognized in net income for these investments for the three and nine month periods below include:

  (12) ESOP  
 All Company employees participate in the 2015 HopFed Bancorp, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ). The ESOP purchased 600,000
shares of the Company s common stock from the Company on March 2, 2015, at $13.14 per share. The ESOP borrowed $7.9 million from an open-end line of credit from the Company for the purchase of the stock, using the 600,000 shares of common
stock as collateral. The Company makes discretionary contributions to the ESOP. The ESOP utilizes these contributions along with the dividends on the 600,000 held by the ESOP to repay the loan from the Company. When loan payments are made, ESOP
shares are released based on reduction in the principal balance of the loan. The shares are allocated to participants based on relative compensation. Employees who are not employed at the December 31st of each year are not eligible for
participation in the ESOP. The Company anticipates that loan payments will be made at the end of each year. Participants receive shares at the end of employment. The Company has the option to repurchase the shares or provide the shares directly to
the employee.    The Company made its first ESOP loan payment in December 2015. In January 2016, the ESOP and Company revised the loan to
the ESOP converting the loan to a closed end note with total payments of approximately $780,000 per year for a term of eleven years. At September 30, 2016, the Company s accrued liability for the loan payment is $528,000. At
September 30, 2016, shares held by the ESOP were as follows:      
   (13) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
 At September 30, 2016, certificates of deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less from September 30, 2016, totaled $135.8
million. At September 30, 2016, the Company has $32.4 million in time deposits greater than $100,000 but less than $250,000 that are schedule to mature in one year and $41.5 million in time deposits greater than $250,000 that are scheduled to
mature in one year or less. Management believes that a significant percentage of such deposits will remain with the Bank. At September 30, 2016, the Company has deposit balances of $29.5 million that exceed FDIC insurance limits without
additional collateral pledged.

   The Bank s FHLB borrowings are secured by a blanket security agreement pledging the Bank s 1-4
family first mortgage loans and non-residential real estate loans. At September 30, 2016, the Bank has pledged all eligible 1-4 family first mortgages. At September 30, 2016, the Bank has outstanding borrowings of $11.0 million from the
FHLB. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had $49.2 million in additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB which includes an overnight line of credit of $30.0 million. The Bank has an $8 million unsecured overnight borrowing capacity from a
correspondent bank. A schedule of FHLB borrowings at September 30, 2016, is provided below:      
   (14) REGULATORY MATTERS  
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory capital rules applicable to
Heritage Bank USA, Inc. and HopFed Bancorp, Inc. The final rules implement the regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in  Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking
Systems  (Basel III) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.    Under these rules, the leverage and risk-based capital ratios of
bank holding companies may not be lower than the leverage and risk-based capital ratios for insured depository institutions. The final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms became effective for the Company and Bank on
January 1, 2015, and include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Moreover, these rules refine the definition of what constitutes  capital  for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1
capital and Tier 2 capital.    The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the
rules are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); (iv) a Tier 1
leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions.  
      43  

Table of Contents  

  The rules also establish a  capital conservation buffer  of 2.5% (to be phased in over
three years) above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, and result in the following minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.    The capital conservation buffer
requirement is being phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share
repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.  
 Under these new rules, Tier 1 capital generally consist of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of
minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory
deductions. Cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, but such securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, including in the case of bank holding companies
with less than $15.0 billion in total assets, trust preferred securities issued prior to that date, will continue to count as Tier 1 capital subject to certain limitations. The definition of Tier 2 capital is generally unchanged for most banking
organizations, subject to certain new eligibility criteria.    Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consist of common stock (plus related
surplus) and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. The final rules allow banks and their holding companies with
less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. The Company has made the decision to opt-out of this
requirement.    The Federal Reserve has adopted regulations applicable to bank holding companies with assets over $10 billion that require

The Board of Directors and senior management are required to consider the results of the stress test in the normal course of business, including but not limited to capital planning and an assessment of capital adequacy in accordance with
management s policies. The FDIC has adopted all guidelines applicable to state nonmember banks in each case. At September 30, 2016, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. The table below presents certain information

     Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations      Critical Accounting Policies   
 The consolidated condensed financial statements as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, and for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, included herein have been prepared by the Company, without an audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in interim financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereon included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders on Form 10-K.  
 Certain of the Company s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition, since they require
management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and
circumstances. Facts and circumstances, which could affect these material judgments, include, but without limitation, changes in interest rates, in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers. Management believes that
its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses, determining the fair value of securities and other financial instruments, and assessing other than temporary impairments of securities.  
  Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015   
 At September 30, 2016, total assets declined $31.3 million, to $871.9 million as compared to $903.2 million at December 31, 2015,
largely due to lower levels of time deposits, investments available for sale, and cash on hand offset by an increase in loans. At September 30, 2016, total cash and cash equivalents was $29.4 million, representing a decline of $25.3 million
decline as compared to December 31, 2015. Securities available for sale declined from $237.2 million at December 31, 2015, to $213.3 million at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, securities
classified as  available for sale  had an amortized cost of $207.3 million and $233.4 million, respectively.    The Company s
holdings of Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati ( FHLB ) stock, at cost were $4.4 million at December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2016. Total FHLB borrowings were $11.0 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to $15.0
million at December 31, 2015. Total repurchase balances declined from $45.8 million at December 31, 2015, to $44.5 million at September 30, 2016. Net loans totaled $579.1 million and $556.3 million at September 30, 2016, and

September 30, 2016, as compared to $1.7 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, net income and net interest income were influenced by a $830,000 recovery on a

million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to September 30, 2015, was largely due to the collection of past due investment
income in 2015.    For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the average yield on loans was 4.55%, as compared to 4.58% for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, income on taxable securities was $3.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively. For the nine month period

was 0.80% and 0.95%, respectively. The average cost of retail time deposits declined from 1.16% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, to 0.95% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016,
and September 30, 2015, the Company s net interest margin was 3.36% and 3.40%, respectively. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, the receipt of past due investment interest added 0.13% to the Company s net
interest margin.     Average Balances, Yields and Interest Expenses . The table on the next page summarizes the overall effect of
changes in both interest rates and the average balances of interest earning assets and liabilities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015. Yields on assets and cost of liabilities are derived by
dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of interest earning assets and liabilities for the appropriate nine-month periods.

respectively. The decline in the average balance of retail time deposits is a result of management s emphasis on the growth of our non-interest checking products to reduce or reliance on higher costing time deposits.

  Provision for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s
evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and the general economy. Such evaluation considers numerous factors including general economic conditions, loan portfolio composition and prior loss experience, the estimated fair value of the
underlying collateral and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance. The Company determined that an additional $1.2 million in provision for loan loss was required for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016, compared to a $760,000 provision for loan loss expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources . The Company has no business other than that of the Bank.
Management believes that dividends that may be paid by the Bank to the Company will provide sufficient funds for its current needs. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will not have a need for additional funds in the future. The Bank
is subject to certain regulatory limitations with respect to the payment of dividends to the Company.    The Bank uses brokered deposits to
supplement its asset liability need for longer term deposits at reasonable prices. In addition to the coupon rate listed below, brokered deposits carry an additional fee of approximately 0.25% that includes the cost of selling and servicing the
deposits. The Company includes this cost as interest expense on its income statement and on its table on page 50 that provides the yields and cost of assets and liabilities.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Bank s brokered deposits consisted of the following:

   Forward-Looking Statements   
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Additional written or oral forward-looking statements may be made by
the Company from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or otherwise. The words  believe,   expect,   seek,  and  intend  and similar expressions identify forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date the statement is made. Such forward-looking statements are within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, projections of income or loss, expenditures, acquisitions, plans for future operations, financing needs or plans relating to services of the Company, as well as assumptions
relating to the foregoing.    Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be
predicted or quantified. Future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims, any obligation to
publicly release the results of revisions, which may be made to forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.  
    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
 The actual results of the Company s asset liability management analysis are highly dependent on the prepayment speed of mortgage backed
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The United States Treasury s policy of purchasing longer dated Treasury bonds has the result of lowering mortgage loan rates, allowing more consumers to refinance their mortgages and pay-off
their current mortgage, resulting in higher prepayment speeds on mortgage investment products.    The effects of rising interest rates are
discussed throughout Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Actual results for the year ending December 31, 2016, will differ from simulations due to timing,
magnitude, and the frequency or interest rate changes, market conditions, management strategies, and the timing of the Company s cash receipts and disbursements.  
 The Company s analysis at September 30, 2016, indicates that changes in interest rates are less likely to result in significant
changes in the Company s annual net interest income. A summary of the Company s analysis at September 30, 2016, for the twelve month period ending September 30, 2017, is as follows:

     Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   
 In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), an evaluation was carried out with
the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2016.    Based upon
their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the nine months ended September 30,
2016, to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, was made known to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this quarterly report on Form 10-Q was being
prepared.    Any control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives are
achieved. The design of a control system inherently has limitations, including the controls cost relative to their benefits. Additionally, controls can be circumvented. No cost-effective control system can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud will be detected.    The Company is subject to Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Section 404 requires management to assess and report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting includes (as such term s defined in rules 13a-15(f)
