NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

These interim financial statements do not contain all necessary disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for a complete set of financial statements and, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of ASB Bancorp, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 14, 2016.  These financial statements were prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements previously referenced and include all normal and recurring adjustments that management believes are necessary in order to conform to GAAP.  The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or any other future period.

Organization    ASB Bancorp, Inc. (the  Parent ) was incorporated on May 12, 2011 by Asheville Savings Bank, S.S.B. (the  Bank ) to be the Bank s holding company upon completion of the Bank s conversion from the mutual to stock form of organization.

The Bank is headquartered in Asheville, North Carolina and provides mortgage, consumer and commercial banking services primarily in Buncombe, Henderson, McDowell, Transylvania, and Madison counties in North Carolina and in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina through loan originators. The Bank is regulated by the Office of the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks ( NCCoB ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The Parent is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the  FRB ) and the NCCoB.

Principles of Consolidation    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank (collectively, the  Company ). The Bank has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Appalachian Financial Services, Inc., which has on occasion managed the Bank s real estate acquired through debt default but is currently inactive, and Wenoca, Inc., which serves as the Bank s trustee regarding deeds of trust. Both subsidiaries are organized as North Carolina corporations. For purposes of the consolidated financial statements, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Use of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investment Securities    Realized gains and losses on sales of investment securities are recognized at the time of sale ( trade date ) based upon the specific identification method.

Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums and discounts. Realized gains and losses are derived from the amortized cost of the security sold. Declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale debt securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary because of credit risk impairment are reflected in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management considers, among other factors, (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, and (iv) whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment prior to a recovery.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Loans    Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized fees and costs on originated loans. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with the lending processes are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the loans.

Loan Segments and Classes

The Bank s portfolio segments and classes within those segments are subject to risks that could have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Management has identified the risks described below as significant risks that are generally similar among the loan segments and classes.

Commercial Loan Segment

The Bank s commercial loans are centrally underwritten based primarily on the customer s ability to generate the required cash flow to service the debt in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the loan agreement. The Bank s commercial lenders and underwriters work to understand the borrower s businesses and management experiences. The majority of the Bank s commercial loans are secured by collateral, so collateral values are important to the transaction. In commercial loan transactions where the principals or other parties provide personal guarantees, the Bank s commercial lenders and underwriters analyze the relative financial strength and liquidity of each guarantor. Risks that are common to the Bank s commercial loan classes include general economic conditions, demand for the borrowers  products and services, the personal circumstances of the principals, and reductions in collateral values.

In addition to these common risks for the Bank s commercial loans, the various commercial loan classes also have certain risks specific to them.

Commercial Construction and Land Development  loans are highly dependent on the supply and demand for commercial real estate in the Bank s markets as well as the demand for the newly constructed residential homes and lots being developed by the Bank s commercial loan borrowers. Prolonged deterioration in demand could result in significant decreases in the underlying collateral values and make repayment of the outstanding loans more difficult for the Bank s commercial borrowers.

Commercial Mortgage and Commercial and Industrial  loans are primarily dependent on the ability of the Bank s commercial loan customers to achieve business results consistent with those projected at loan origination resulting in cash flow sufficient to service the debt. To the extent that a borrower s actual business results significantly underperform the original projections, the ability of that borrower to service the Bank s loan on a basis consistent with the contractual terms may be at risk. While these loans and leases are generally secured by real property, personal property, or business assets such as inventory or accounts receivable, it is possible that the liquidation of the collateral will not fully satisfy the obligation.

Non-Commercial Loan Segment

The Bank underwrites its non-commercial loans using automated credit scoring and analysis tools. These credit scoring tools take into account factors such as payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, types of credit currently in use, and recent credit inquiries. To the extent that the loan is secured by collateral, the value of the collateral is also evaluated. Common risks to each class of non-commercial loans include general economic conditions within the Bank s markets, such as unemployment and potential declines in collateral values, and the personal circumstances of the borrowers.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

In addition to these common risks for the Bank s non-commercial loans, various non-commercial loan classes may also have certain risks specific to them.

Residential Mortgage and Non-Commercial Construction and Land Development  loans are to individuals and are typically secured by one-to-four family residential property, undeveloped land, and partially developed land in anticipation of pending construction of a personal residence. Significant and rapid declines in real estate values can cause residential mortgage loan borrowers to have debt levels in excess of the current market value of the collateral. Recent declines in value have led to unprecedented levels of foreclosures and losses within the banking industry. Non-commercial construction and land development loans can experience delays in completion and cost overruns that exceed the borrower s financial ability to complete the project. Such cost overruns can result in foreclosure of partially completed and unmarketable collateral.

Revolving Mortgage  loans are often secured by second liens on residential real estate, thereby making such loans particularly susceptible to declining collateral values. A substantial decline in collateral value could render the Bank s second lien position to be effectively unsecured. Additional risks include lien perfection inaccuracies and disputes with first lien holders that may further weaken collateral positions. Further, the open-end structure of these loans creates the risk that customers may draw on the lines in excess of the collateral value if there have been significant declines since origination.

Consumer  loans are often closed-end whereby the loan is fully disbursed when the loan closes and is repaid according to agreed upon specified dates.  Consumer loans include loans secured by personal property such as automobiles, marketable securities, other titled recreational vehicles including boats and motorcycles, as well as unsecured consumer debt. The value of underlying collateral within this class is especially volatile due to potential rapid depreciation in values since date of loan origination in excess of principal repayment.

Credit Quality Indicators

Loans are monitored for credit quality on a recurring basis and the composition of the loans outstanding by credit quality indicator is provided below.

Loan credit quality indicators are developed through review of individual borrowers on an ongoing basis, although certain non-commercial loans, including residential mortgage, revolving mortgage and consumer loans, are evaluated upon origination and are reevaluated upon a change in delinquency status. Most commercial loans are evaluated at least annually with more frequent evaluation of more severely criticized loans or leases. The indicators represent the rating for loans as of the date presented based on the most recent assessment performed. These credit quality indicators are defined as follows:

Pass    A pass rated asset is not adversely classified because it does not display any of the characteristics for adverse classification.

Special Mention    A special mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, such potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Substandard    A substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor and/or the realizable value of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets classified as substandard generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These assets are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

Doubtful    An asset classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values.

Loss    Assets classified loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuing to be carried as an asset is not warranted. This classification is not necessarily equivalent to no potential for recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not appropriate to defer a full write-off even though partial recovery may be effected in the future.

Allowance for Loan Losses    The allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the Bank s loan portfolios at the balance sheet date. The allowance increases when the Bank provides for loan losses through charges to operating earnings and when the Bank recovers amounts from loans previously written down or charged off. The allowance decreases when the Bank writes down or charges off loan amounts that are deemed uncollectible.

Management determines the allowance for loan losses based on periodic evaluations that are inherently subjective and require substantial judgment because the evaluations require the use of material estimates that are susceptible to significant change. The Bank generally uses two allowance methodologies that are primarily based on management s determination as to whether or not a loan is considered to be impaired.

Commercial loans, as well as non-commercial loans that are classified as substandard and secured by real estate, are evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis and are considered impaired when it is probable, based on current information, that the borrower will be unable to pay contractual interest or principal as required by the loan agreement. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls are not necessarily considered impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment history, and the amount of the shortfall relative to the principal and interest owed. Loans that are deemed to be troubled debt restructurings, which are discussed below, are also included as impaired loans. Impaired loans are measured at their estimated fair value based on either the value of the loan s expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or on the collateral value, net of the estimated costs of disposal, if the loan is collateral dependent. For loans considered impaired, an individual allowance for loan losses is recorded when the loan principal balance exceeds the estimated fair value.

For loans not considered impaired, management determines the allowance for loan losses based on estimated loss percentages that are determined by and applied to the various classes of loans that comprise the segments of the Bank s loan portfolio. The estimated loss percentages by loan class are based on a number of factors that include by class (i) average historical losses over the past three years, (ii) levels and trends in delinquencies, impairments, and net charge-offs, (iii) trends in the volume and direction of loan balances within that class, terms, and concentrations, (iv) trends in interest rates, (v) effects of changes in the Bank s risk tolerance, underwriting standards, lending policies, procedures, and practices, and (vi) national and local business and economic conditions.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Methodology change    The Bank made no changes to its allowance methodology in the first nine months of 2016 or 2015.

Future material adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to improving or deteriorating economic conditions, delinquencies, charge-off levels or declining collateral values. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for loan losses and may require the Bank to make adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based upon judgments that differ significantly from those of management.

Nonperforming Assets    Nonperforming assets can include loans that are past due 90 days or more and continue to accrue interest, loans on which interest is not being accrued, and foreclosed real estate.

Loans Past Due 90 Days or More, Nonaccruing, Impaired, or Restructured    The Bank s policies related to loans that are placed on nonaccruing status conform to guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Generally, the Bank suspends the accrual of interest on loans (i) that are maintained on a cash basis because of the deterioration of the financial condition of the borrower, (ii) for which payment in full of principal or interest is not expected, or (iii) on which principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. While a loan is on nonaccruing status, the Bank recognizes interest income only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of collection of the principal outstanding on the loan. Loans are returned to accruing status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and concern no longer exists as to the future collectability of principal and interest, which is generally confirmed when the loan demonstrates performance for six consecutive months or payment cycles.

A troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) occurs when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Bank grants a concession it would not otherwise consider to provide the borrower relief from one or more of the contractual loan conditions. Concessions that the Bank might consider include the allowance of interest-only payments on more than a temporary basis, the reduction of interest rates, the extension of the loan term, the forgiveness of principal, or a combination of these. The Bank might require additional collateral or additional guarantors as conditions to modifying loans as TDRs.

The Bank might consider modifying both accruing or nonaccruing loans as TDRs. When a modification includes a reduction of principal that resulted from a partial charge-off of the loan, the Bank typically accounts for the TDR as a nonaccruing loan.

The Bank classifies TDRs as impaired loans and evaluates the need for an allowance for loan loss on a loan-by-loan basis consistent with its evaluation of impaired loans that have not been modified as TDRs. An allowance is based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less any selling costs, if the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent.

The Bank s policy for recognition of interest income on loans considered to be impaired, including restructured loans, is the same as its interest income recognition policy for loans not considered to be impaired.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Loan Charge-Offs    The Bank charges off loan balances, in whole or in part, when available, verifiable, and documentable information confirms that specific loans, or portions of specific loans, are uncollectible or unrecoverable. For unsecured loans, losses are confirmed when it can be determined that the borrower, or any guarantor, is unwilling or unable to pay the amounts as agreed. When the borrower, or any guarantors, are unwilling or unable to pay the amounts as agreed on a loan secured by collateral and any recovery is dependent upon the sale of the collateral, the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent. Repayments or recoveries for collateral dependent loans are directly affected by the value of the collateral at liquidation.  As such, loan repayment can be affected by factors that influence the amount recoverable, the timing of the recovery, or a combination of the two. Such factors include economic conditions that affect the markets in which the loan or its collateral is sold, bankruptcy, repossession and foreclosure laws, and consumer banking regulations. Losses are also confirmed when the loan, or a portion of the loan, is classified as loss resulting from loan reviews conducted by the Bank.

Charge-offs of loans in the commercial loan segment are recognized when the uncollectibility of the loan balance and the inability to recover sufficient value from the sale of any collateral securing the loan is confirmed. The uncollectibility of the loan balance is evidenced by the inability of the commercial borrower to generate cash flows sufficient to repay the loan as agreed causing the loan to become delinquent. For collateral dependent commercial loans, the Bank determines the fair value of the collateral based on appraisals, current market conditions, and estimated costs to sell the collateral. For collateral dependent commercial loans where the loan balance, including any accrued interest, net deferred fees or costs, and unamortized premiums or discounts, exceeds the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, the deficiency is identified as unrecoverable, is deemed to be a confirmed loss, and is charged off.

Charge-offs of loans in the non-commercial loan segment are generally confirmed and recognized in a manner similar to loans in the commercial loan segment. Secured non-commercial loans that are identified as uncollectible and are deemed to be collateral dependent are confirmed as loss to the extent the fair value of the collateral is insufficient to recover the loan balance. Closed-end consumer loans that become 120 cumulative days past due and open-end consumer loans that become 180 cumulative days past due are charged off to the extent that the fair value of any collateral, less estimated costs to sell the collateral, is insufficient to recover the loan balance. Closed-end and open-end loans secured by residential real estate that become 180 days past due are charged off to the extent that the fair value of the residential real estate securing the loan, less estimated costs to sell the collateral, is insufficient to recover the loan balance. Loans determined to be fraudulent are charged off within 90 days of discovery. Loans to borrowers in bankruptcy are subject to modification by the bankruptcy court and are charged off to the extent that the fair value of any collateral securing the loan, less estimated costs to sell the collateral, is insufficient to recover the loan balance, unless the Bank expects repayment is likely to occur. Such loans are charged off within 60 days of the receipt of notification from a bankruptcy court or when the loans become 120 days past due, whichever is shorter.

Foreclosed Real Estate    Foreclosed real estate consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of customers  loan defaults. Foreclosed real estate is stated at the lower of the related loan balance or the fair value of the property net of the estimated costs of disposal with a charge to the allowance for loan losses upon foreclosure. Any write-downs subsequent to foreclosure are charged against operating earnings. To the extent recoverable, costs relating to the development and improvement of property are capitalized, whereas those costs relating to holding the property are charged to expense.

Bank Owned Life Insurance    The Bank has purchased bank owned life insurance ( BOLI ) as a financing tool for employee benefits. The earnings on the BOLI are recorded as other noninterest income. Since the Bank intends to hold the BOLI until the death of the insured, the Bank benefits from the tax-free nature of income generated from the life insurance policies. The value of the life insurance to the

Bank is the tax preferred treatment of increases in life insurance cash values and death benefits and the cash flow generated at the death of the insured. The largest risk to the BOLI program is credit risk of the insurance carriers. To mitigate this risk, annual financial condition reviews are completed on all carriers.

Comprehensive Income    Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of an enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources and, accordingly, includes both net income and amounts referred to as other comprehensive income ( OCI ). The items of OCI are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The accumulated balance of OCI is included in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company s components of accumulated OCI include unrealized gains and/or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale and certain changes in the Company s benefit obligations under its retirement plans. The Company adjusts the level of accumulated OCI related to its retirement plans on an annual basis, consistent with the receipt of its annual actuarial studies.

The changes in the components of the Company s accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes, are presented as follows:

Income Taxes    The establishment of provisions for federal and state income taxes is a complex area of accounting that involves the use of significant judgments and estimates in applying relevant tax statutes. The Company is subject to audit by federal and state tax authorities, the results of which may produce tax liabilities that differ from the Company s tax estimates and provisions. The Company continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and it records its estimate of possible exposure based on current facts and circumstances. The Parent and the Bank have entered into a formal agreement that will allow them, if so elected, to file consolidated federal and state income tax returns, where permitted, and each to pay its respective share of income taxes due.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. When uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset, the carrying value of the asset may be reduced by a valuation allowance. The amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered. Increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes.

The Bank includes interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities in noninterest expense. The Bank s tax filings for the years 2012 and thereafter are currently open to audit under statutes of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and the North Carolina Department of Revenue.

Pension Plan    The Bank has two noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans. The Bank recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as an asset or liability in its consolidated statement of financial position and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the change occurs through comprehensive income. The funded status of a benefit plan is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. GAAP also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position and to include additional disclosure in the notes to financial statements about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP )    In connection with the mutual-to-stock conversion on October 11, 2011, the Bank established an ESOP for the benefit of all of its eligible employees. Full-time employees of the Bank who have been credited with at least 1,000 hours of service during a twelve-month period and who have attained age 21 are eligible to participate in the ESOP.  Shares allocated under the ESOP vest at the rate of 20% per year of service beginning with the completion of two years of service and fully vest upon the completion of six years of service. The Bank anticipates it will make contributions to the ESOP in amounts necessary to amortize the ESOP loan payable to the Parent over a period of 15 years in accordance with the terms of the loan.

Unallocated ESOP shares are not considered outstanding (including for the calculation of net income per common share as discussed below) and are shown as a reduction of shareholders  equity. Dividends on unallocated ESOP shares, if paid, are considered to be compensation expense. The Company recognizes compensation cost equal to the fair value of the ESOP shares during the periods in which they are committed to be released. The fair value of the annual share allocations is recorded on a monthly basis with fair value determined by calculating the average closing stock price for each day during the month. To the extent that the fair value of the Company s ESOP shares differs from the cost of such shares, the difference is recognized in shareholders  equity. The Company recognizes a tax deduction equal to the cost of the shares released. Because the ESOP is internally leveraged through a loan from the Parent to the ESOP, the loan receivable by the Parent from the ESOP is not reported as an asset nor is the debt of the ESOP shown as a liability in the consolidated financial statements.

Equity Incentive Plan    The Company issued restricted stock and stock options under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2012 Equity Incentive Plan ) to key officers and outside directors during the first quarter of 2013 and to additional key officers and a newly appointed outside director during 2014.  There were no grants under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan during 2015 or during the first nine months of 2016.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The Company uses a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock compensation plans, whereby compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date and recognized over the vesting period.

Net Income Per Common Share    Where presented, basic net income per common share is the Company s net income available to common shareholders, which represents net income less dividends paid or payable to preferred stock shareholders, if any, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. In calculating the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, shares held by the ESOP are not considered to be outstanding until they are committed to be released for allocation.  Also, the weighted average of unvested restricted shares are not considered outstanding until the shares vest.

For diluted income per common share, net income available to common shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding for each period plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance. The effects of restricted stock and stock options are excluded from the computation of diluted income per common share in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive. Potential common shares that might be issued by the Company relate solely to outstanding stock options and restricted stock and are determined using the treasury stock method.

Net income per common share has been computed based on the following:

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, no restricted shares and no stock options were excluded from the computation of net income per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, no restricted shares were excluded from the computation of net income per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, options to purchase 1,178 and 3,916 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the computation of net income per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

The following tables show investment gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The total number of securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were 31 and 34, respectively. The unrealized losses relate to debt and equity securities that have incurred fair value reductions due to higher market interest rates since the securities were purchased. The unrealized losses are not likely to reverse unless and until market interest rates decline to the levels that existed when the securities were purchased. Management has the intent to hold securities with unrealized losses until a recovery of the market value occurs. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell any of the securities with unrealized losses prior to a recovery of market value sufficient to negate the unrealized loss. Management has analyzed the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers and determined that the Company will collect all contractual cash flows and, therefore, all impairment is considered to be temporary.

There were no loans modified as TDRs within the preceding 12 months that stopped performing during the three months or nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.

In the determination of the allowance for loan losses, management considers TDRs on loans and the subsequent nonperformance in accordance with their modified terms, by measuring impairment loan-by-loan based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.

The Bank s loans that were considered to be TDRs follow:

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank had $344,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, of residential real estate loans in the process of foreclosure and $658,000 and $705,000, respectively, of foreclosed residential real estate property included in foreclosed real estate.

5. BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Benefit Plans    The Bank has a Qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee s compensation during employment. The Bank s funding policy is based on actuarially determined amounts. Prior service costs are amortized using the straight line method. Contributions are intended to provide for not only benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. In addition, the Bank also has a Non-Qualified plan covering certain officers whose benefit under the Qualified plan would be reduced as a result of Internal Revenue Code limitations. The Non-Qualified plan is an unfunded plan and any benefits payable shall be paid from the general assets of the Bank.

In January 2013, the Board of Directors amended the Bank s Qualified and Non-Qualified pension plans (the  Plans ), effective March 31, 2013, to curtail or eliminate benefits under the Plans for services to be performed in future periods.  During 2013, pension expense was decreased by a $499,000 one-time credit that resulted from the curtailment of benefits for future service.

In June 2014, the Board of Directors further amended the Bank s Plans, effective September 16, 2014, to offer immediate lump sum payments to inactive participants having an actuarial equivalent of vested accrued benefits below $60,000, determined as of November 1, 2014, as available.  The total of immediate aggregate lump sum payments to all inactive participants making the lump sum selection was approximately $544,000 for 2014.

In June 2015, the Board of Directors further amended the Bank s Plans, effective September 1, 2015, to offer immediate lump sum payments to inactive vested participants, determined as of October 31, 2015, as available.  The total of immediate aggregate lump sum payments to all inactive participants making the lump sum selection was approximately $846,000 for 2015.

In April 2016, the Bank decided to settle its qualified pension plan liability for all remaining participants effective July 1, 2016.  The settlement is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 when participants receive annuities or lump sum payments of their accrued benefit balances.  Based on the most recently available information, the estimate of the one-time settlement charge is in the range of $7.6 million to $7.7 million before income taxes, or $4.8 million to $4.9 million after income taxes, of which $8.0 million before income taxes, or $5.1 million after income taxes, was recognized as a reduction of tangible common shareholders  equity in the form of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2015.  The most recently available estimate of the range of earnings per share dilution is $1.34 to $1.36 per share, while little or no common equity book value dilution is expected.  For periods following the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Bank estimates annual periodic expense savings of approximately $810,000 before income taxes, or $513,000 after income taxes, or $0.14 per share.  The Bank contributed $4.8 million to the qualified pension plan during the third quarter of 2016.  Actual settlement expenses may differ from the estimates provided.

Net periodic cost related to defined benefit plans include the following components for the periods indicated:

5. BENEFIT PLANS (Continued)

Employee Stock Ownership Plan    In conjunction with the Parent s initial public offering in 2011, the Bank established an ESOP to provide eligible employees the opportunity to own Parent stock. The Parent provided a loan to the ESOP in the amount of $4,468,000, which was used to purchase 446,764 shares of the Parent s common stock at a price of $10.00 per share in the Parent s initial public offering. The loan bears a fixed interest rate of 3.25% and provides for annual payments of interest and principal over the 15 year term of the loan.

The Bank committed to make contributions to the ESOP sufficient to support the debt service of the loan. The loan is secured by the shares purchased, which are held in a trust until released for allocation to the participants as principal and interest payments are made by the ESOP to the Parent.

Shares released are allocated to each eligible participant based on the ratio of each participant s   compensation, as defined in the ESOP, to the total compensation of all eligible plan participants. Forfeited   shares shall be reallocated among other active participants in the Plan. At the discretion of the Bank, cash   dividends, when paid on allocated shares, will be distributed to participants  accounts or used to repay the   principal and interest on the ESOP loan used to acquire Parent stock on which dividends were paid. Cash   dividends on unallocated shares will be used to repay the outstanding debt of the ESOP. 

Shares held by the ESOP include the following:

As ESOP shares are earned by the participants, the Company recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of the earned ESOP shares during the periods in which they become committed to be released.

Total expense recognized in connection with the ESOP follows:

2012 Equity Incentive Plan -  The Company s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2012 Equity Incentive Plan ) provides for awards of restricted stock and stock options to key officers and outside directors. Cost recognized under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan is based on the fair value of restricted stock and stock option awards on their grant date.  The maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the plan is 781,837 shares, including 223,382 for restricted stock shares and 558,455 shares for stock options.

Shares of common stock granted under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan may be issued from authorized but unissued shares or, in the case of restricted stock awards, may be awarded with shares purchased on the open market.  During 2012, the Company purchased 223,382 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $3.6 million, or an average of $16.12 per share, through an independent trustee to fulfill anticipated restricted stock awards.  The share-based awards granted under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan have some similar characteristics, except some awards have been granted in restricted stock and other awards have been granted in stock options.  Therefore, the following disclosures have been disaggregated for the restricted stock awards and the stock option grants under the plan due to their dissimilar characteristics.

Share-based compensation expenses related to restricted stock and stock options recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $273,000 and $802,000, respectively, and were $273,000 and $801,000, respectively, for the same periods of 2015.

6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Loan Commitments  - The Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.

The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it does for instruments that are included in the balance sheet.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income-producing commercial real estate.

6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank s policy for obtaining collateral, and the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit.

The Bank s commitments to extend or originate credit and under standby letters of credit follow:

Concentrations of Credit Risk  - The Bank s primary market area consists of Buncombe, Henderson, McDowell, Transylvania and Madison counties of North Carolina.  The majority of the Bank s loans are residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans. The Bank s policy generally will allow residential mortgage loans up to 80% of the value of the real estate that is pledged as collateral or up to 95% with private mortgage insurance and commercial real estate loans up to 85% of the value of the real estate that serves as collateral to secure the loan.

Interest Rate Risk  - The Bank s profitability depends to a large extent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Like most financial institutions, the Bank s interest income and interest expense are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates and other economic factors beyond its control. The Bank s interest-earning assets consist primarily of long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans, adjustable rate mortgage loans, commercial loans, and investments that typically adjust more slowly to changes in interest rates than its interest-bearing liabilities, which are primarily term deposits. Accordingly, the Bank s earnings are usually adversely affected during periods of rising interest rates and positively impacted during periods of declining interest rates. However, based on the results of the Bank s interest rate risk simulation model, which management believes accurately reflects the extraordinary stress currently existing in the financial markets with respect to potential margin compression resulting from the Bank s difficulty in reducing its cost of funds further in this competitive pricing environment, the Bank s earnings may well be adversely affected if interest rates decline further. Such a decline in rates could result from, among other factors, the Federal Reserve Board s purchase of government securities and/or mortgage-backed securities in an effort to further stimulate the economy. Accordingly, the Bank is carefully monitoring, through its Asset/Liability management process, the competitive landscape related to interest rates as well as various economic indicators in order to optimally position the Bank in terms of changes in interest rates.

Litigation  - The Bank is periodically involved in legal actions in the normal course of business. The Bank is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that, after consultation with its legal counsel, the Bank s management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Investment Commitments  - During 2012, the Bank entered into an agreement to invest $2.0 million as a limited partner in a Small Business Investment Company. The Bank invested $350,000 of its investment commitment in 2013, $250,000 in 2014, $200,000 in 2015 and $300,000 in 2016.  This investment is recognized using the cost method and is included in  other assets  on the balance sheet.

7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

FASB  ASC Topic 820:   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( FASB ASC Topic 820 ) requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed below.  The estimated fair value amounts shown below have been determined by the Bank using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Bank could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or valuation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no highly liquid market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.

The fair value estimates presented below are based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued since the dates presented herein and, therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented.

The fair value measurement and disclosure guidance contained in FASB ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

Level 1

The fair values of Level 1 assets are determined by quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury debt securities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

Level 2

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, SBA asset-backed securities, securities issued by state and local governments, and corporate debt securities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, loans receivable held for investment, accrued interest receivable and payable, time deposits, repurchase agreements, and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances.

The methodologies for estimating fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as discussed below. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for cash and cash equivalents, accrued interest, Federal Home Loan Bank Stock and demand deposits.

Investment Securities    Investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is primarily based upon quoted prices of like or similar securities, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. The fair values of investments in mutual funds are determined by quoted prices and are included as recurring Level 1 assets. The fair values of investments in securities issued by U.S. GSEs, asset-backed securities issued by the SBA, residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. GSEs, and securities issued by state and local governments are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions and are included as recurring Level 2 assets.

Loans Held for Sale    Loans held for sale are residential mortgages carried at the lower of cost or market value. The market values of loans held for sale are based on what mortgage buyers are currently offering on a  best efforts  basis to buy the loans. As such, mortgages held for sale are classified as nonrecurring Level 2 assets.

Loans Receivable    For variable rate loans, carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. For fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated based on discounted future cash flows using the current interest rates at which loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality. Valuation adjustments are made for credit risk, which are represented by the allowance for loan losses, but do not include adjustments for illiquidity or other market risks.

7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

The Bank does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with the accounting guidance contained in FASB  ASC Topic 310:   Receivables  ( FASB ASC Topic 310 ). The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value, or discounted cash flows. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. Substantially all of the total impaired loans are evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral. In accordance with the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance contained in FASB ASC Topic 820, impaired loans where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral require classification in the fair value hierarchy.

When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the impaired loan is recorded as nonrecurring Level 2 assets. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Bank records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 3 assets.

Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable    The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Deferred Compensation Assets    Assets include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Fair values are obtained from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.

Demand and Savings Deposits    By definition, the carrying values are equal to the fair values.

Time Deposits and Repurchase Agreements    Fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the FHLB Rate Curve for similar remaining maturities. Fair value of repurchase agreements is estimated using the borrowing rate for overnight borrowings.

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances    The fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank advances is estimated using the rates currently offered for advances of similar remaining maturities.

Deferred Compensation Liabilities    Fair values are measured based on the fair values of the related deferred compensation assets.

Defined Benefit Plan Assets    The Nonqualified Defined Benefit Plan had no plan assets because it was not funded. The assets of the Qualified Defined Benefit Plan, which are invested in interest-bearing depository accounts and money market, debt and equity security mutual funds, are included at fair value in the Qualified Plan s separate financial statements. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices of like or similar securities. The fair values of the Plan s investments in interest-bearing depository accounts and money market, debt and equity security mutual funds are determined by quoted prices and are included as recurring Level 1 assets.

Foreclosed Properties    Foreclosed properties are measured and recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The fair value of foreclosed properties is measured using the current appraised value of the property less the estimated expenses necessary to sell the property. Foreclosed properties are classified as nonrecurring Level 3 assets.

A Caution About Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as  believes,   expects,   anticipates,   estimates  or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:

statements of our goals, growth and performance targets, intentions and expectations;

statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;

statements regarding the quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and

estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits.

These forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to, among others, the following factors:

general economic conditions, either nationally or in our primary market area, that are worse than expected;

a decline in real estate values;

changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our interest margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;

increased competitive pressures among financial services companies;

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;

legislative, regulatory or supervisory changes that adversely affect our business;

adverse changes in the securities markets;

increased cyber security risk, including potential business disruptions or financial losses;

changes in technology;

our ability to attract and retain key personnel;

changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and

the risks outlined in the  Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Any of the forward-looking statements that we make in this quarterly report and in other public statements we make may later prove incorrect because of inaccurate assumptions, the factors illustrated above or other factors that we cannot foresee. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed.

Except as required by applicable law or regulation, ASB Bancorp, Inc. does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

Critical Accounting Policies

During the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, there were no significant changes in critical accounting policies or the application of critical accounting policies as disclosed in the our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. The following represent our critical accounting policies:

44 

Table of Contents 

Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to earnings. Management s estimates of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are:  loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance monthly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the FDIC and the NCCoB, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect our earnings. See notes 1 and 4 included in the consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value of Investments.  Securities are characterized as available for sale or held to maturity based on management s ability and intent regarding such investment at acquisition. On an ongoing basis, management estimates the fair value of its investment securities based on information and assumptions it deems reliable and reasonable, which may be quoted market prices or if quoted market prices are not available, fair values extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments. Based on this information, an assessment must be made as to whether any decline in the fair value of an investment security should be considered as an other than temporary impairment and recorded in noninterest income as a loss on investments. The determination of such impairment is subject to a variety of factors, including management s judgment and experience. See notes 2 and 7 included in the consolidated financial statements.

Pension Plan.  The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan. This plan is accounted for under the provisions of FASB  ASC Topic 715: Compensation-Retirement Benefits  ( FASB ASC Topic 715 ), which requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The funded status of a benefit plan is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. FASB ASC Topic 715 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position. Management must make certain estimates and assumptions when determining the projected benefit obligation. These estimates and assumptions include the expected return on plan assets and the appropriate discount rate to be used in determining the present value of the obligation.  In April 2016, the Bank decided to settle its qualified pension plan liability effective July 1, 2016.  See note 5 included in the consolidated financial statements regarding the plan termination.

Foreclosed Real Estate.   The Company's valuations of its foreclosed real estate involve significant judgments and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the reported values of foreclosed real estate assets and noninterest expense recorded in the financial statements. The judgments and assumptions used by management are described in  Foreclosed Real Estate  under note 1 included in the consolidated financial statements.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015

The following table provides the changes in our significant asset and liability categories at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.

47 

Table of Contents 

Assets.  Total assets increased $14.3 million, or 1.8%, to $797.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $782.9 million at December 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents increased $11.4 million, or 34.0%, to $44.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $33.4 million at December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to the sale of investment securities. Investment securities decreased $31.3 million, or 22.2%, to $110.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $141.3 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the sale of investment securities to fund loan growth. Loans receivable, net of deferred fees, increased $21.8 million, or 3.8%, to $597.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $576.1 million at December 31, 2015 as new loan originations, primarily residential mortgage and commercial real estate loan originations, exceeded loan repayments, prepayments and foreclosures. The increase in other assets was primarily attributable to a $10.0 million investment in general account bank owned life insurance during the second quarter of 2016 and $4.1 million in securities sold but not settled at September 30, 2016.

Nonperforming Assets.  Nonperforming assets totaled $6.0 million, or 0.75% of total assets, at September 30, 2016 compared to $8.2 million, or 1.05% of total assets, at December 31, 2015. Nonperforming assets included $1.2 million in nonperforming loans and $4.8 million in foreclosed real estate at September 30, 2016 compared to $2.5 million and $5.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015.

Nonperforming loans decreased $1.3 million and were $1.2 million, or 0.21% of total loans, at September 30, 2016 compared to $2.5 million, or 0.44% of total loans, at December 31, 2015.  Commercial mortgage nonperforming loans decreased $818,000, and residential and revolving nonperforming mortgage loans decreased $543,000 for the first nine months of 2016.  Performing troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) decreased $119,000, or 2.6%, when comparing the same periods. Total performing TDRs and nonperforming assets decreased $2.3 million, or 18.1%, to $10.4 million, or 1.31% of total assets, at September 30, 2016 from $12.7 million, or 1.63% of total assets, at December 31, 2015.

At September 30, 2016, nonperforming loans included four residential mortgage loans that totaled $731,000, three revolving home equity loans that totaled $229,000, four commercial and industrial loans that totaled $200,000, one consumer loan in the amount of $42,000, and two construction and land development loans that totaled $35,000.  As of September 30, 2016, the nonperforming loans had specific reserves totaling $92,000. TDRs were $4.6 million at September 30, 2016 and $5.5 million at December 31, 2015.  There were no additions to TDRs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  At September 30, 2016, $4.4 million of the $4.6 million TDRs were performing.

Foreclosed real estate at September 30, 2016 included seven properties with a total recorded amount of $4.8 million compared to six properties with a total recorded amount of $5.6 million at December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, two new properties totaling $663,000 were added to foreclosed real estate, while one property in the amount of $685,000 was sold with an additional loss of $2,000.  In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Bank sold four of its residential lots in a mixed-use lot subdivision for net proceeds of $139,000 and one unit in a mixed-use condominium for net proceeds of $701,000.  The Bank recorded $18,000 in additional loss provisions on foreclosed real estate during the first nine months of 2016, and there were no capital additions during the period.

Liabilities.  Total deposits increased $11.7 million, or 1.9%, to $642.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $630.9 million at December 31, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we continued our focus on core deposit growth, from which we exclude certificates of deposit.  Core deposits increased $15.2 million, or 3.1%, to $510.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $495.6 million at December 31, 2015.

Commercial checking and money market accounts increased $16.3 million, or 11.1%, to $163.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $147.0 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting expanded sources of lower cost funding.  Our efforts to obtain new commercial deposit relationships in conjunction with making new commercial loans significantly contributed to this increase and reflects our commitment to establishing diversified relationships with business clients.

Certificates of deposit decreased to $131.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $135.3 million at December 31, 2015 as we continued our focus on core deposit growth in addition to increasing longer term brokered deposits by $6.4 million since December 31, 2015.  Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased $3.3 million, or 27.9%, to $8.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $11.9 million at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities at September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a $4.8 million contribution to the Bank s employee pension plan during the third quarter.  At September 30, 2016, $4.5 million in investment securities were purchased but not settled.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Overview.   Net income was $1.7 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $1.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Net interest income increased $529,000, which was the result of a $523,000 increase in total interest and dividend income and a $6,000 decrease in interest expense.  The recovery of loan losses was $92,000 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to a provision for loan losses of $191,000 for the same period of 2015, primarily due to continued improvement in asset quality and a decline in loan volume during the quarter. Noninterest income increased $206,000 and noninterest expenses increased $24,000 during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Noninterest income increased for the third quarter of 2016 primarily due to the increase in income from loan prepayment fees and from investment in bank owned life insurance.  Noninterest expenses increased slightly, primarily in data processing fees and advertising expenses. The income tax provision increased $411,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same quarter of 2015.

Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased by $529,000, or 9.5%, to $6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Total interest and dividend income increased $523,000, or 8.1%, to $7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase of $35.6 million in average loan balances and a 15 basis point increase in the average yield on loans.  Interest on investment securities decreased $76,000, attributable to a $27.4 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities primarily to fund loan growth, which was partially offset by a 24 basis point increase in the average yield earned on the investment portfolio. Interest expense decreased $6,000, or 0.7%, to $871,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $877,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a $15.5 million decrease in the average balances of certificates of deposit and a decrease in rates paid on NOW and money market accounts, which were partially offset by increases in the average balances of other deposits and an increase of 8 basis points in the average rate paid on certificates of deposits.  When comparing these same three-month periods, average noninterest-bearing deposits grew $11.7 million, or 10.0%, which contributed to minimizing deposit interest expense while deposit funding grew.

Interest income on loans increased $579,000, or 10.0%, to $6.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in average outstanding loans of $35.6 million, or 6.3%. Loan originations decreased $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to lower originations of commercial loans, and residential mortgage loan sales decreased by $2.9 million. Loan principal repayments increased $22.5 million to $63.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $40.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The average balance of the investment portfolio decreased $27.3 million, or 19.7%, to $111.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as securities were sold to fund loan originations, repurchases of the Company s common stock and contributions to the Bank s employee pension plan that occurred during the third quarter of 2016.

Provision for Loan Losses.   The recovery of loan losses was $92,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a provision for loan losses of $191,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in the provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to continued improvement in asset quality and a decline in loan volume since the second quarter of 2016. The allowance for loan losses totaled $6.5 million, or 1.08% of total loans, at     September 30, 2016 compared to $6.3 million, or 1.09% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. We charged off $43,000 in loans during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $46,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Noninterest Income.  Noninterest income increased $206,000, or 9.9%, to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Factors that contributed to the increase in noninterest income during the 2016 quarterly period included increases of $174,000 in collected loan fees, $87,000 in income from investment in bank owned life insurance, and $38,000 in deposit and other service charge income, which were partially offset by decreases of $55,000 in gains realized from the sale of investment securities and $36,000 in income from debit card services. Increased income on deposit and other fees primarily related to ATM and overdraft fees.

Noninterest Expenses.   Noninterest expenses increased $24,000, or 0.4%, to $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to increases of $89,000 in data processing fees, $46,000 in advertising and $33,000 in recruiting expenses, which were partially offset by decreases of $69,000 in compensation and employee benefits, $32,000 in loan expenses and $31,000 in deposit insurance premiums. The decrease in compensation and employee benefits was primarily attributable to lower employee compensation expenses.

Income Tax Provision.  Income tax provision increased $411,000 to $907,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $496,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 34.46% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 30.28% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, with the increase primarily resulting from a decrease in favorable permanent tax differences relative to the size of the pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015.

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Overview.  Net income was $4.5 million, or $1.23 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.65 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Income before income taxes increased $3.1 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase of $1.6 million in net interest income, an increase of $1.2 million in noninterest income, a decrease of $360,000 in noninterest expenses and a decrease of $39,000 in provision for loan losses.

Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased by $1.5 million, or 9.6%, to $17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $16.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Interest income on loans increased $1.5 million, primarily resulting from a $48.0 million increase in average loan balances and a 1 basis point increase in the average yield on loans.  Interest on investment securities decreased $53,000, attributable to an $18.3 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities primarily to fund loan growth, which was partially offset by a 29 basis point increase in the average yield earned on the investment portfolio. Interest expense decreased $49,000, or 1.9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The lower interest expense was primarily attributable to $19.6 million in lower average balances of certificates of deposit, as well as an average rate reduction of 1 basis point on total interest-bearing deposits. The decrease in average balances of certificates of deposit was partially offset by higher average balances of NOW, money market and savings accounts. For the same comparable nine-month periods, average   noninterest-bearing deposits grew $13.8 million, or 13.0%, which contributed to the reduction of deposit interest expense while deposit funding grew. 

Provision for Loan Losses.  The Company recorded a provision for loan losses in the amount of $411,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $450,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company charged off $311,000 in loans for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $435,000 for the first nine months of 2015.  The decrease in the nine-month provision for loan losses was primarily due to continued improvement in asset quality and slower growth in loans.

Noninterest Income.   Noninterest income increased $1.1 million, or 20.4%, to $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Factors that contributed to the increase in noninterest income during the 2016 period included increases of $918,000 in gains realized from the sale of investment securities, $234,000 in deposit and other service charge income, $101,000 in collected loan fees and $96,000 in income from an investment in bank owned life insurance, which were partially offset by a decrease of $141,000 in mortgage banking income. Increased income on deposit and other fees primarily related to retail checking accounts. The decrease in mortgage banking income was attributable to lower volumes of residential mortgage loans originated and sold during the 2016 period.

Noninterest Expenses.  Noninterest expenses decreased $360,000, or 2.0%, to $17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $17.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The lower 2016 noninterest expenses primarily reflected decreases of $173,000 in salaries and employee benefits, $168,000 in loan expenses, $84,000 in mortgage software expenses, $77,000 in deposit insurance premiums, $43,000 in indirect auto loan dealer expenses and $39,000 in foreclosed property expenses, which were partially offset by increases of $204,000 in data processing fees and $69,000 in professional and outside services primarily due to revenue enhancement consulting fees.

Income Tax Provision . Income tax expense increased by $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 35.02% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 32.19% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, with the increase primarily resulting from a decrease in favorable permanent tax differences relative to the size of the pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015.

Average Balances and Yields

The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs are derived by dividing annualized income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities for the periods presented.  Average balances have been calculated using daily balances. Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances only.  Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and are not material.  The yields on tax exempt loans and municipal investment securities have been included on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal marginal tax rate of 34%.

Rate/Volume Analysis . The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior period volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate). The net column represents the sum of the volume and rate columns. Changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume have been allocated proportionally based on the absolute dollar amounts of change in each.

With the prolonged low interest rate environment, the interest rate component continues to reflect the  pressures of net interest margin compression. The growth in loans has led to favorable changes in the volume component and overall net interest income levels in 2016 compared to 2015.

Risk Management

Overview . Managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available-for-sale securities that are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Other risks that we face are operational risks, liquidity risk and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue.

Credit Risk Management . Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. We do not offer Alt-A, sub-prime or no-documentation mortgage loans.

When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. When the loan becomes 15 days past due, a late notice is sent to the borrower. When the loan becomes 30 days past due, a more formal letter is sent. Between 15 and 30 days past due, telephone calls are also made to the borrower. After 30 days, we regard the borrower in default. At 60 days delinquent, the borrower may be sent a letter from our attorney and we may commence collection proceedings. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. Generally, when a consumer loan becomes 60 days past due, we institute collection proceedings and attempt to repossess any personal property that secures the loan. Management informs the Board of Directors monthly of the amount of loans delinquent more than 30 days, all loans in foreclosure and repossessed property that we own.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets and Classified Assets . We consider repossessed assets and loans that are 90 days or more past due and certain loans that are less than 90 days past due, but that we will not be able to collect the full amount of, to be nonperforming assets. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days delinquent, or sooner if the facts and circumstances indicate that we will not be able to collect the full amount of the loan, at which time the accrual of interest ceases and accrued interest is reversed and deducted from income. Typically, payments received on a nonaccrual loan are first applied to the outstanding principal balance to the extent that principal is due and then recognized as interest income.

Real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold. Property acquired through foreclosure is recorded at the lower of its cost or fair market value at the date of foreclosure. Any holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income.

We periodically modify loans by allowing interest-only payments on more than a temporary basis, reducing interest rates, forgiving principal, or a combination of these to help borrowers remain current and avoid foreclosure. These modified loans, also referred to as TDRs, totaled $4.6 million at September 30, 2016 and $5.5 million at December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, no loans were restructured during the period. At September 30, 2016, $146,000 of the total $4.6 million of TDRs were not performing according to their restructured terms and were included in the previous nonperforming assets table as nonaccruing loans.

Interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to $36,000 and $125,000 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $48,000 and $135,000, respectively, for the comparable periods of 2015.  Interest income of $212,000 and $304,000 related to impaired loans was recognized for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $53,000 and $162,000, respectively, for the same periods of 2015.

At September 30, 2016, our nonaccruing loans of $1.2 million, including nonperforming TDRs, were primarily comprised of the following:

Commercial Construction and Land Development Loans

Two loans to unrelated borrowers for the purchase of land with an aggregate balance of $35,000. As of September 30, 2016, the loans were considered impaired with no specific reserves.

Residential Mortgage Loans

Seven loans to multiple unrelated borrowers on one-to-four family residential properties with an aggregate balance of $960,000 as of September 30, 2016.

At September 30, 2016, our performing TDRs of $4.4 million included the following:

Commercial Mortgage Loans

One loan for the purchase of an existing mobile home park to be used for future development secured by nonowner-occupied commercial real estate located in coastal South Carolina. The loan was modified in the fourth quarter of 2014, which extended the terms of the loan and required scheduled principal payments. The future performance of the loan is dependent upon the guarantor group s willingness and ability to service the debt. Such willingness and ability was demonstrated by the fact that, as of September 30, 2016, the loan was a performing TDR with a balance of $2.9 million that matures in May of 2017. As of September 30, 2016, the loan was considered impaired and had a specific reserve of $13,000.

Residential Mortgage Loans

Eleven loans to multiple unrelated borrowers on one-to-four family residential properties with an aggregate balance of $1.5 million as of September 30, 2016.

Foreclosed properties consisted of the following at the dates indicated.

An analysis of foreclosed real estate follows:

The Bank s largest foreclosed property resulted from a loan relationship that had an original purpose of constructing a mixed-use retail, commercial office, and residential condominium project located in Western North Carolina. As a result of this foreclosure, the Bank acquired 44 of the 48 condominium units in the building. Following an additional write-down of approximately $630,000 on the loans secured by this collateral in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Bank recorded this foreclosed property in the amount of $9.8 million.  During 2013, the Bank recorded additional write-downs totaling $1.6 million, which resulted in an adjusted recorded amount of $8.2 million at December 31, 2013.  During 2014, the Bank recorded an additional write-down of $133,000 on the property and sold 28 residential condominium units and one office unit.  During 2015, the Bank sold one retail unit and two office units.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Bank sold one retail unit.  As of September 30, 2016, the adjusted recorded amount was $3.3 million for the remaining six retail units and five office units.

Federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis. In addition, the FDIC and the NCCoB have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful, and loss.  Substandard assets  must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Doubtful assets  have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, and there is a high possibility of loss. Assets classified  loss  are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continued recognition as an asset of the institution is not warranted. The regulations also provide for a  special mention  category, described as assets which do not currently expose an institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving close attention. When we classify an asset as substandard or doubtful, we may establish a specific allowance for loan losses. If we classify an asset as loss, we charge off an amount equal to 100% of the portion of the asset classified loss.

The following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified and special mention assets at the dates indicated.

Other than as disclosed in the above tables and related discussions, there were no other loans where management had serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms.

At September 30, 2016, substandard loans totaling $2.5 million included $1.0 million in nonaccruing loans that were previously discussed as nonperforming loans. The remaining $1.5 million in performing substandard loans included the following:

Commercial Mortgage Loans

Two loans to one borrower on two commercial properties located in western North Carolina. As of September 30, 2016, the loans were performing with a total balance of $603,000.

Residential Mortgage Loans

Nine loans to multiple unrelated borrowers for one-to-four family residential properties with an aggregate balance of $856,000 as of September 30, 2016.

Adversely classified assets include loans that are classified due to factors other than payment delinquencies, such as the absence of current financial statements and other required documentation, insufficient cash flows or other deficiencies, and therefore, are not included as nonperforming assets.

At September 30, 2016, special mention loans included the Bank s largest performing TDR commercial mortgage as previously discussed.

Liquidity Management.  Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.

We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) expected deposit flows, (iii) yields available on securities and interest-earning deposits we place with other banks, and (iv) the objectives of our asset-liability management policy.

Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits.  The level of these assets depends on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $44.8 million, including $35.2 million in interest-bearing deposits in other banks, of which $30.7 million was on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank.  Investment securities totaling $106.3 million at September 30, 2016 classified as available-for-sale provided an additional source of liquidity. In addition, at September 30, 2016, we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately $94.1 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and approximately $8.4 million from the Federal Reserve Bank s discount window. At September 30, 2016, we had $50.0 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding and $6.0 million in letters of credit to secure public funds deposits.

A significant use of our liquidity is the funding of loan originations. At September 30, 2016, we had $202.4 million in commitments to extend credit outstanding, although we expect that significantly less will ultimately be funded. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2016 totaled $63.5 million, or 48.2%, of total certificates of deposit.  We believe the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customer hesitancy to invest funds for longer periods due to the continued low interest rate environment and local competitive pressure. If these maturing deposits do not remain with us, we may seek other sources of funds, including new certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the maturing certificates of deposit. However, based on past experience, we believe that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We believe we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates we offer.

In addition, we believe that our branch network, which is presently comprised of 13 full-service branch offices located throughout our primary market area, and the general cash flows from our existing lending and investment activities will afford us sufficient long-term liquidity.

The following tables present our contractual obligations as of the dates indicated.

Capital Management.  We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC and the NCCoB, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At September 30, 2016, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements and were considered  well capitalized  under regulatory guidelines.

We strive to manage our capital for maximum shareholder benefit. The capital from our October 2011 stock offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources. Over time, the initial level of liquidity was reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering were used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of lending activities.  Our financial condition and results of operations were enhanced by the capital from the offering, resulting over time in increased net interest-earning assets and net income.  However, the large increase in equity resulting from the capital raised in the conversion offering had an adverse impact on our return on equity. To help us better manage our capital, we repurchased shares of our common stock and may consider other capital deployment measures as regulations permit.

Regulatory capital rules released by the federal bank regulatory agencies in July 2013 to implement capital standards, referred to as Basel III and developed by an international body known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, impose higher minimum capital requirements for certain bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements are imposed on  advanced approaches  banking organizations   which are organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, with $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted in to the Basel II capital regime.  The new regulatory capital rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions), and all of the requirements in the rules will be fully phased in by January 1, 2019. However, in May 2015, amendments to the Federal Reserve's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (the  SBHC Policy ) became effective which increased the asset size limitation for qualifying bank holding companies under the SBHC Policy from $500 million to $1 billion of total consolidated assets. Bank holding companies which are subject to the SBHC Policy are not subject to compliance with the regulatory capital requirements until they exceed $1 billion in total consolidated assets. As a result, as of September 30, 2016, the Company was not required to comply with the requirements set forth below until such time that its consolidated assets exceed $1 billion or the Federal Reserve determines that the Company is no longer deemed to be a small bank holding company. However, if the Company had been subject to the requirements, it is management's belief that it would have been in compliance with such requirements.

The final rule includes certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements apply to the Bank:

a new Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;

a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);

a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from former requirements); and

a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).

Under the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rules have disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment.  Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital.  Accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital.  The rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We elected to opt out from the inclusion of AOCI in Common Equity Tier 1 capital.

In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a  capital conservation buffer  on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and will consist of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.  As of January 1, 2016, we are required to hold a capital conservation buffer of 0.625%, increasing by that amount each successive year until 2019.

In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.

It is management s belief that, as of September 30, 2016, the Bank would have met all capital adequacy requirements under the new capital rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were effective at that time.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements . In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers  requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, unused lines of credit and letters of credit.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest Rate Risk Management . We manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. To reduce the potential volatility of our earnings, we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread. Our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes: adjusting the maturities of borrowings; adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration; and, generally selling in the secondary market substantially all newly originated fixed rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans. We currently do not participate in hedging programs, interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments.

We have an Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ) which includes our Chairman of the Board and an additional Director, both of whom are Independent Directors, and members of Senior Management, to communicate, coordinate and control all aspects involving asset-liability management. The Committee meets quarterly to establish and monitor the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals.

Our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest and net income.

Interest Rate Risk Analysis . Our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Like most financial institutions, our interest income and interest expense are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates and other economic factors beyond our control. Our interest-earning assets consist of fixed and floating rate loans and investment securities that generally adjust more slowly to changes in interest rates than our interest-bearing liabilities, which are primarily non-maturity deposits. Accordingly, our earnings are usually adversely affected during periods of rising interest rates and positively impacted during periods of declining interest rates. The recent periods of sustained historically low interest rates have also reduced our net interest margins as we could not lower our cost of interest-bearing liabilities commensurate with the reductions in the yields on our interest-earning assets.

We implement an interest rate risk simulation model to determine our possible adverse exposure to net interest income and economic value of equity due to changes in interest rates, repricing risk, yield curve risk and basis risk. Our internal simulation model evaluates our projected future net interest income and economic value of equity under various interest rate scenarios and applies certain contractual and behavioral assumptions to calculate results in an increasing rate scenario, in a decreasing rate scenario and in a constant rate scenario. The major assumptions applied to our internal simulation model include, but are not limited to, the present value discounting method, calculated and reported rate shock and rate ramp scenarios, key rates, curves and spreads, internal rate restrictions (such as rate floors and caps and teaser rates), prepay and decay tables and interest rate exposure limits.

Based on the results of our internal simulation model, which management believes accurately reflects the extraordinary stress currently existing in the financial markets with respect to potential margin compression resulting from our difficulty in reducing our costs of funds further in the current competitive pricing environment, our earnings may be adversely affected if interest rates were to further decline. Such a decline could result from, among other things, the Federal Reserve Board s purchase of government securities and/or mortgage-backed securities in an effort to further stimulate the national economy. Although the current rate environment remains stable, we continue to carefully monitor, through our Asset/Liability Committee management process, the competitive landscape related to interest rates as well as various economic indicators in order to best position ourselves with respect to changing interest rates.

The following table reflects the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on the present value of our equity and on our projected net interest income over the next twelve months.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures 

The Company s management has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of its  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company has evaluated, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  In connection with the above evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, no changes in its internal control over financial reporting were identified as having occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
