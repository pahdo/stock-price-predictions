CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS   

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans,
objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are  forward-looking
statements.  These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words  believes,   project, 
 expects,   anticipates,   estimates,   intends,   strategy,   plan, 
 may,   will,   would,   will be,   will continue,   will likely
result,  and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are
subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our
ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have
a material adverse affect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes
in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted
accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue
reliance should not be placed on such statements.  

PART
I     

Item 1.   
       Business    

We
were incorporated on March 4, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Since September 15, 2015, we have operated through a
wholly-owned subsidiary RM Fresh Brands Inc. ( RM Fresh ), who services food and beverage retailers and distributors
who are looking for innovative, trend-setting products across North America and in international markets. With a focus on sustainable,
category changing consumables, RM Fresh acquired the rights to distribute an extensive portfolio of highly desirable brands, including
Boxed Water, Cleansify, Uncle Si s Iced Tea, Chef 5-Minute Meals, Gurkha Cigars, Shimla Foods, Aloe Gloe and Arriba Horchata.
Through a network of sub-distribution partners across Canada, RM Fresh provides national product distribution and brokerage services.
RM Fresh has an emerging focus on the United States and Middle East through the establishment of sub-distribution partners.  

On
August 31, 2016, in order to fund the ongoing operation and further development of RM, we consented to new third party investments
into RM in the approximate total amount of $175,000, made in the form of cash and retirement of indebtedness owed by RM. As result
of these new investments into RM, our ownership percentage of the company has been reduced to twenty percent (20%). In addition,
we entered into a new Shareholder Agreement with RM, under which our shares in RM are subject to certain restrictions on transfer
until such time as we declare a shareholder dividend of our RM shares following a going public transaction by RM, or in the alternative,
for one (1) year after RM completes a going public transaction. Further, we disposed of an inter-company liability owed to us
by RM in the amount of CDN$166,961.70. The liability was documented under a Demand Promissory Note issued to us by RM. We then
assigned the note to an investor in RM in exchange for $3,000. Finally, we entered into a mutual Release agreement with RM. Under
the Release, we released and discharged all liabilities owed to us by RM (with the exception of the Demand Promissory Note). RM
in turn released us of all liabilities owing to RM and released us all ongoing contractual and financial responsibilities to RM,
including our contractual obligation to further fund management fees or other expenses to be incurred by RM.  

Going
forward, we are continuing as a holding company owning a 20% ownership stake in RM. Our management is also reviewing additional
opportunities for new business.

Penny
Stock    

The
SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are
generally equity securities with a market price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities
exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such
securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny
stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature
and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of
the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation
of such duties or other requirements of the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market,
including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a
toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or
in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type
size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.  

The
broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations
for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares
to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for
such stock; and (d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.  

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving
penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.  

These
disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, stockholders may
have difficulty selling our securities.  

Holders
of Our Common Stock    

As
of October 5, 2016, we had 29,527,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, held by thirty-four (34) shareholders
of record.  

Dividends

There
are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes,
however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend:  

1.
we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or;  

  2.
our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights
of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.  

We
have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.  

Item 6.   
       Selected Financial Data     

A
smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.  

Item 7.   
       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations    

Results of Operations for the
Years Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015   

During the year ended June 30, 2016, we
generated gross revenues of $200,265. Total cost of sales was $126,819, resulting in gross profit of $73,446. Total operating
expenses were $1,608,708, consisting of professional fees of $1,412,606, management fees of $152,283, and general expenses of
$117,265. The expenses recorded for professional fees consisted primarily of the fair value of shares of common stock issued to
directors and consultants as compensation for services.  

In addition, during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2016, we recorded an expense of $2,101,785 for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, $8,694 in interest and bank
charges, and amortization expense of $70,350. We also recorded gains of $17,974 for forgiveness of a loan and a $22,965 positive
translation adjustment. Our net loss for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $3,771,563. 

By comparison, during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2015, we generated no revenues and incurred professional fees of $103,781, general expenses of $361, and a negative translation
adjustment of $51. Our net loss for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $104,142. 

Our
results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 reflect our food and beverage business as conducted through RM Fresh.
Our results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, however, reflect our former real estate consulting business
conducted prior to our acquisition of RM Fresh on September 30, 2015. Going forward, and as a result of the dilution of our ownership
in RM Fresh and the related transactions discussed above, we expect that our revenues and expenses will decrease materially.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As
of June 30, 2016, we had current assets in the amount of $370,835, consisting of cash in the amount of $2,993, accounts and other
receivable of $264,880, inventory in the amount of $78,891 and harmonized sales tax recoverable of $24,071. As of June 30, 2016,
we had current liabilities in the amount of $457,870. These consisted of accounts payable in the amount of
$326,476, amounts due to related parties of $60,145, amounts due to stockholders of $19,455, and notes payable of $51,794. Our
working capital deficit as of June 30, 2016 was therefore $87,035. As of June 30, 2016, we had no long term liabilities.   

During the year ended June 30, 2016, operating
activities used a net $291,105 in cash, investing activities provided $3,671 in cash, and financing activities provided $397,147
in cash. In addition, we had a negative cash adjustment in the amount of $110,100 for foreign currency translation. 

We
have experienced net losses from inception and will be dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to
fund our ongoing operations and continued existence. There can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will
be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to us, in which case we may be unable to meet our ongoing obligations.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

As
of June 30, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.  

Going
Concern    

We
have experienced net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $3,879,336 as of June 30, 2016 and have not been
able to generate revenues sufficient to become cash flow positive. Our ability to continue operations during the next 12 months
and beyond will be contingent upon obtaining additional financing. For these reasons, our auditor has raised substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern.    

Critical
Accounting Policies    

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most  critical accounting polices  in the Management
Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a  critical accounting policy  is one which is both important to the
portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
We believe that the following accounting policies currently fit this definition.  

Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation   

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and are expressed in United States dollars ( USD ). The Company s fiscal year-end
is June 30. The parent Company s functional currency is US dollar and for subsidiary Canadian ( CDN ) dollar.
The Company s reporting currency is U.S. dollar. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiary RM Fresh, Inc. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in preparing the
consolidated financial statements.  

Cash   

Cash
includes cash on hand and balances with banks.  

Inventories   

Inventories
which comprise of finished goods, is valued at the lower of cost and market value, with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out
basis. The cost of finished goods consists of purchase price, freight, custom duties and other delivery expenses. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any applicable selling costs. The Company evaluate
the carrying value of inventory on a regular basis, taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales
compared with quantities on hand and the price the Company expects to obtain for products in market compared with historical cost.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenues when they are earned, specifically when all of the following conditions are met:  

ownership of the goods have been transferred to the
customers. Ownership of the goods is transferred to the customers when the good are transferred to a designated carrier in accordance
with shipping terms agreed with the customer.   

there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;   

there are no significant obligations remaining;   

amounts are fixed or can be determined; and   

the ability to collect is reasonably assured.   

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable are stated at outstanding balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts
is established through provisions charged against income. Accounts deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance
and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance is based on past experience, aging of the receivables, adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability
to pay, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates
that may be susceptible to significant change. Unpaid balances remaining after the stated payment terms are considered past due.
The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, therefore, believes that its accounts receivable credit
risk exposure is limited.  

Segment
Reporting   

The
Company operates in one operating and geographical segment based on the activities for the Company in accordance with ASC Topic
280-10. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that
is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources
and in assessing performance. All the sales of the Company are in Canada.  

Goodwill
and Identifiable Intangible Assets   

Goodwill
and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives that are not being amortized, such as trade names, are tested at
least annually for impairment and are written down if impaired. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized
over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying
values may not be fully recoverable. The intangible assets with definite lives are being amortized over its estimated useful lives
of 5 years using the straight-line method.  

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share   

The
Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Topic 260-10 which provides for calculation
of  basic  and  diluted  earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed
by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity.
Diluted earnings per share exclude all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially
dilutive shares outstanding as at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.  

Foreign
Currency Translation   

The
parent Company s functional currency is US dollar and subsidiary's functional currency is Canadian ( CDN ) dollar.
The Company s reporting currency is U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the historical rate on the date of the transaction. All exchange gains
or losses arising from translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in net income (loss) for the year. In translating
the financial statements of the Company's subsidiary from their functional currency into the Company's reporting currency of US
dollars, balance sheet accounts are translated using the closing exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for monetary
items and using the historical rate on the date of the transaction for non-monetary items, and income and expense accounts are
translated using an average exchange rate prevailing during the reporting period. The translation gains and losses resulting from
the changes in exchange rates are reported in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss).  

Shipping
and Handling Costs   

The
Company accounts for shipping and handling fees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 705  Cost of Sales and Services .
Costs related to raw materials purchased, are included in inventory or cost of goods sold, as appropriate. While amounts charged
to customers for shipping product are included in revenues, the related outbound freight costs are included in expenses as incurred.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

ASC
Topic 820   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or
most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure
fair value:  

Level
 1 - Valuation based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

  Level
 2 - Valuation based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets.  

  Level
3 - Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring
management s best estimate of what market participants would use as fair value.  

In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular
input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  

Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management.
The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term
nature of these instruments or interest rates that are comparable to market rates. These financial instruments include due from
a shareholder, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, due to shareholders and note payable. The Company's cash,
which is carried at fair value, is classified as a Level 1 financial instruments. Bank accounts are maintained with financial
institutions of reputable credit, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for under ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Company provides for federal and provincial income taxes
payable, as well as for those deferred because of the timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement
purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recoverable or settled. The effect of a change in
tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period of the change. A valuation allowance is established, when necessary,
to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

In accordance with ASC 360-10, the Company,
on a regular basis, reviews the carrying amount of long-lived assets for the existence of facts or circumstances, both internally
and externally, that suggest impairment. The Company determines if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is impaired based
on anticipated undiscounted cash flows, before interest, from the use of the asset. In the event of impairment, a loss is recognized
based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined based on appraised
value of the assets or the anticipated cash flows from the use of the asset or asset group, discounted at a rate commensurate
with the risk involved. The Company has assessed its long-lived assets and has determined that there is an impairment of goodwill
and other intangibles amounting to $2,101,785 as explained in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements. 

Stock
Based Compensation   

The
Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with the provision of ASC 718, which requires that all share-based payments
issued to acquire goods or services, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of operations
based on their fair values, net of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and
revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation expense related to
share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The Company accounts
for stock based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either the fair value
of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable, using
the guidelines in ASC 505-50. The Company issues compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management,
accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of  

  Legacy
Ventures International, Inc.   

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Legacy Ventures International, Inc. and its subsidiary (the  Company )
as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders 
deficiency, and cash flows for  each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2016.
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.   

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatements. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended June 30, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s losses from operations raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

  NATURE OF OPERATIONS   

Legacy
Ventures International, Inc. (the  Company ) is a Management Company incorporated on March 4, 2014 in the State of
Nevada. Upon its recent acquisition of RM Fresh Brands Inc. (formerly Influx Global Media Inc.) [ RM Fresh ], it is
engaged in the food and beverage distribution business whose principal place of business is located at 2215-B Renaissance Drive,
Las Vegas, Nevada, 89119 USA.   

As
explained in Note 5, on September 30, 2015 (the  Closing ), the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the
 Agreement ) with and among RM Fresh and its shareholders. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of
the issued and outstanding shares of RM Fresh in exchange for the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock.
As a result of this transaction, RM Fresh became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the former shareholders of RM Fresh
owned approximately 7% of the Company s shares of common stock.  

RM
Fresh was incorporated on July 29, 2008 under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. RM Fresh is engaged in the business
of trading and distribution of food, beverages and body care products.  

2.
  GOING CONCERN   

The Company s consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. During the current year, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations and as at
June 30, 2016 has a working capital deficiency of $87,035 and accumulated deficit of $3,879,336 which has primarily arisen from
a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the current period. Further, as explained in Note 12, on August 31, 2016, the Company s
ownership percentage of RM Fresh has been reduced to 20%. The Company s continued existence is dependent upon its ability
to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance that the
necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, in which case the
Company may be unable to meet its obligations. Should the Company be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities
in the normal course of business, the net realizable value of its assets may be materially less than the amounts recorded in the
financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded asset
amounts that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.

  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (continued)  

Cash   

Cash
includes cash on hand and balances with banks.  

Inventories   

Inventories
which comprise of finished goods, is valued at the lower of cost and market value, with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out
basis. The cost of finished goods consists of purchase price, freight, custom duties and other delivery expenses. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any applicable selling costs. The Company evaluate
the carrying value of inventory on a regular basis, taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales
compared with quantities on hand and the price the Company expects to obtain for products in market compared with historical cost.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenues when they are earned, specifically when all of the following conditions are met:  

ownership
                                         of the goods have been transferred to the customers. Ownership of the goods is transferred
                                         to the customers when the good are transferred to a designated carrier in accordance
                                         with shipping terms agreed with the customer.   
 
         there
                                         is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;   
 
         there
                                         are no significant obligations remaining;   
 
         amounts
                                         are fixed or can be determined; and   
 
         the
                                         ability to collect is reasonably assured.    

Accounts
Receivable    

Accounts
receivable are stated at outstanding balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts
is established through provisions charged against income. Accounts deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance
and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance is based on past experience, ageing of the receivables, adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability
to pay, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates
that may be susceptible to significant change. Unpaid balances remaining after the stated payment terms are considered past due.
The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, therefore, believes that its accounts receivable credit
risk exposure is limited.

Segment
Reporting   

The
Company operates in one operating and geographical segment based on the activities for the Company in accordance with ASC Topic
280-10.  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available
that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources
and in assessing performance. All the sales of the Company are in Canada.  

Goodwill
and Identifiable Intangible Assets   

Goodwill
and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives that are not being amortized, such as trade names, are tested at
least annually for impairment and are written down if impaired. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized
over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying
values may not be fully recoverable. The intangible assets with definite lives are being amortized over its estimated useful lives
of 5 years using the straight-line method.  

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share   

The
Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Topic 260-10 which provides for calculation
of  basic  and  diluted  earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed
by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity.
Diluted earnings per share exclude all potentially dilutive shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially
dilutive shares outstanding as at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.

that there is an impairment of intangible assets amounting to $2,101,785 as explained in Note 5.  

Stock
Based Compensation   

The
Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with the provision of ASC 718, which requires that all share-based payments

of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable, using
the guidelines in ASC 505-50. The Company issues compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management,
accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
March 2016, the Company adopted the accounting pronouncement issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
to update guidance on how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. This pronouncement is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. This
guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled
and changes the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows.

  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (continued)  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements  (continued)  

The
Company adopted these provisions on a prospective basis. In addition, this pronouncement changes guidance on: (a) accounting for
forfeitures of share-based awards and (b) employers  accounting for an employee s use of shares to satisfy the employer s
statutory income tax withholding obligation. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the financial
position and/or results of operations.  

In
February 2016, an accounting pronouncement was issued by the FASB to replace existing lease accounting guidance. This pronouncement
is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding
lease liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases. Expenses associated with leases will continue to be recognized in a manner
similar to current accounting guidance. This pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The adoption is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis for each prior
reporting period presented. The Company has not yet determined the effect that the adoption of this pronouncement may have on
the financial position and/or results of operations.  

On
January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the accounting pronouncement issued by the FASB which eliminates the requirement that an
acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize
a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment. The adoption of this pronouncement
did not have a material impact on the financial position and/or results of operations.  

On
January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the accounting pronouncement issued by the FASB to update the guidance related to the presentation
of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires debt issuance costs, related to a recognized debt liability, be presented in the
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than being presented as an asset.
The Company adopted this pronouncement on a retrospective basis, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the financial
position and/or results of operations.  

In
November 2015, an accounting pronouncement was issued by the FASB to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes within
the balance sheet. This pronouncement eliminates the requirement that deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as current
or noncurrent based on the nature of the underlying assets and liabilities. Instead, the pronouncement requires all deferred tax
assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances, be classified as noncurrent. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company intends to adopt this pronouncement on January
1, 2017, and the adoption will not have a material impact on the financial position and/or results of operations.

  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (continued)  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements  (continued)  

In
May 2014, an accounting pronouncement was issued by the FASB to clarify existing guidance on revenue recognition. This guidance
includes the required steps to achieve the core principle that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods
or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods or services. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2017, with early adoption permitted. The guidance permits the use of one of two retrospective transition methods. The Company
has not yet selected a transition method nor has the Company determined the effect that the adoption of the pronouncement may
have on the financial position and/or results of operations.

  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   

Business
Acquisition   

ASC
Topic 805,  Business Combinations  requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the acquisition
method and that certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill.
ASC Topic 350,  Intangibles-Goodwill and Other  ( ASC 350 ) requires goodwill and other identifiable intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, such as trade names, but instead tested at least annually for impairment
(which the Company tests each year end, absent any impairment indicators) and be written down if impaired. ASC 350 requires that
goodwill be allocated to its respective reporting unit and that identifiable intangible assets with finite lives be amortized
over their useful lives.  

On
September 30, 2015 (the  Closing ), the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Agreement )
with and among RM Fresh and its shareholders. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of RM Fresh in exchange for the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock. As a result of this transaction,
RM Fresh became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the former shareholders of RM Fresh owned approximately 7% of the
Company s shares of common stock.  

This
acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of assets, liabilities and intangible
assets and the purchase price allocation as of September 30, 2015 was as follows:  

The
purchase consideration of 2,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock valued as detailed below:

  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  (continued)  

Goodwill

The
Company tests for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. In assessing whether goodwill is impaired, the Company utilize
the two-step process as prescribed by ASC 350. The first step of this test compares the fair value of the reporting unit, determined
based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying
amount, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the goodwill impairment test would
need to be performed to measure the amount of an impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the impairment is computed by comparing
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount
of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss in the amount
of the excess is recognized and charged to statement of operations.  

As
at June 30, 2016, the remaining carrying value of goodwill amounting to $1,703,135 was impaired since the carrying value was less
than the fair value.  

Intangible
assets   

Identifiable
intangible assets having gross values of $469,000 ($445,550 net of amortization charge of $23,450) comprise of gross fair values
of trade-name of $236,000 and customer base/distribution rights of $233,000. Relief from royalty approach was used to arrive at
the fair value of trade-name using major assumptions a) 2% royalty rate; b) 10 year life; c) cost to maintain trade name at $2,000
increasing 2.75% annually; and d) discount rate of 22%. Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method was used to arrive at the fair value
of customer base/distribution rights using major assumptions a) net sales base from years 2015 to 2025; b) retention rate of 85%
and c) discount rate of 22%.  

Amortization
expense of $70,350 on these intangible assets were recorded for the year ended June 30, 2016.  

As
at June 30, 2016, the remaining carrying value of intangibles amounting to $398,650 were impaired since the carrying value was
less than the fair value.  

6.
  ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES   

These represent trade accounts receivable of $130,343, net of allowance of $48,943, and other receivable of
$134,537. Other receivable relates to a distributor listing fee recoverable from a supplier under an arrangement with the Company. 

7.
  NOTES PAYABLE   

Outstanding
note payable of $51,794 represents unsecured promissory notes amounting to $26,000 and $25,794 issued on April 1, 2015 and March
4, 2016, respectively bearing interest at 20% and 12% per annum, respectively, repayable within a year from issuance date. Interest
accrued on these notes during year ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $6,218 ($nil for year ended June 30, 2015).

Further,
on August 21, 2015 the Company issued $180,000 convertible notes payable bearing interest at 10% p.a. repayable on February 21,
2017. The principal amount and accrued interest were convertible into common stock of the Company at the option of the holder
at any time from the date of issuance $1. The Company concluded that there is no beneficial conversion feature determined in accordance
with the guidance provided in ASC 470. Accordingly, these notes were recognized as liability at the time of issuance. On September
30, 2015 all the Holders exercised their right to convert the outstanding principal amount of these notes, into shares of the
Company s common stock at a price of $1.00 per share (Note 9).

  FORGIVENESS OF LOAN    

Loan
amounting to $17,974 provided by a related party to RM Fresh before acquisition to meet the working capital requirements and was
unsecured, interest free and was repayable on demand. During year ended June 30, 2016, the related party agreed to forgive the
loan in favour of the Company.

  INCOME TAXES   

Income
taxes    

The provision for income
taxes differs from that computed at the Canadian and US combined corporate tax rate of approximately 34% for the year ended June
30, 2016 (US corporate tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2015 - 39%) as follows: 

Deferred
tax assets    

Deferred
taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences
are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
on the date of enactment.  

Net
deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of June 30:  

At June 30, 2016 the Company had net operating
loss carry forwards of approximately $601,824 (June 30, 2015: $107,773) that may be offset against future taxable income from
the year 2017 to 2037. No tax benefit has been reported in the June 30, 2016 consolidated financial statements since the potential
tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.

  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

The
Company s management has evaluated subsequent events up to October 13, 2016, the date the consolidated financial statements
were issued, pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855 and has determined the following significant subsequent event to report:   

On
August 31, 2016, the Company entered into a group of transactions related to the subsidiary company, RM Fresh. In order to fund
the ongoing operation and further development of RM, the Company consented to new third party investments into RM Fresh in the
approximate total amount of $175,000, made in the form of cash and retirement of indebtedness owed by RM Fresh. As result of these
new investments into RM Fresh, the Company s ownership percentage of RM Fresh has been reduced to twenty percent (20%).
In addition, the Company entered into a new Shareholder Agreement with RM Fresh, under which the Company s shares in RM
Fresh are subject to certain restrictions on transfer until such time as the Company declares a shareholder dividend of its RM
Fresh shares following a going public transaction by RM Fresh, or in the alternative, for one (1) year after RM Fresh completes
a going public transaction.     

Item
    9.   
       Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on
Accounting and Financial Disclosure     

No
events occurred requiring disclosure under Item 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  

Item 9A.   
       Controls and Procedures     

As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Based
upon that evaluation, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of June 30,
2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses
in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate
segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and
financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.  

We
plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered
by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate
such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017: (i) appoint additional
qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written
policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent
upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing
such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.  

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
to an exemption for non-accelerated filers set forth in Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act.

      President, CEO, CFO, and Director   

Set
forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of each of our current executive officers and directors.  

Rehan
Saeed  is our current Chief Financial Officer and had previously served as our Chief Executive Officer and President until
September 30, 2015. From 2007 to September of 2014, Mr. Saeed has been the Vice President of Product Development of AYA Financial,
Inc, where he co-authored a number of white papers for various real estate-related financial products. Mr. Saeed started his career
at CIBC-Edulinx, dealing with government sponsored student loans. He worked as an Interest Relief Analyst. Subsequently, he joined
UM Financial, Inc. ( UM Financial ), a firm providing residential real estate mortgages and was their first employee.
He performed the sales and marketing functions at UM Financial and was instrumental in the rapid growth of the firm from a start-up
company to one that manages a real estate mortgage portfolio of nearly $110 million in just two (2) years. Since 2006, Mr. Saeed
has been regularly conducting seminars and certificate courses on alternative finance in Canada especially in the area of residential
real estate. Mr. Saeed specialized in product structuring and compliance and had vast experience working with individuals of diverse
backgrounds.  

Mr.
Saeed s formal education in finance and subsequent work experience in financial institutions has given him unique exposure,
both in Canada and abroad. Mr. Saeed has written many white papers, most notably an original research white paper on an Interest
Free Mortgage Investment Corporation which was presented at the 4-day Banking   Finance Conference held in Toronto in 2007.   

Mr.
Saeed obtained a Master in Business Administration in Banking and Finance from the International University of Malaysia and a
Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from York University in Toronto, Canada.  

Term
of Office    

Our
Directors are appointed for a one year term to hold office until the next annual general meeting of our shareholders or until
removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until
removed by the board.  

Family
Relationships    

There
are no family relationships between or among the directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by the Company to
become directors or executive officers.  

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings    

To
the best of our knowledge, during the past ten years, none of the following occurred with respect to a present or former director,
executive officer, or employee: (1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general
partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in
a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);
(3) being subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his or her involvement in any type of business,
securities or banking activities; and (4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has
not been reversed, suspended or vacated.  

Committees
of the Board    

We
do not currently have a compensation committee, executive committee, or stock plan committee.  

Audit
Committee    

We
do not have a separately-designated standing audit committee. The entire Board of Directors performs the functions of an audit
committee, but no written charter governs the actions of the Board when performing the functions of what would generally be performed
by an audit committee. The Board approves the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with the independent
accountants to discuss issues related to financial reporting. In addition, the Board reviews the scope and results of the audit
with the independent accountants, reviews with management and the independent accountants our annual operating results, considers
the adequacy of our internal accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters including fees to be paid
to the independent auditor and the performance of the independent auditor. Our Board of Directors, which performs the functions
of an audit committee, does not have a member who would qualify as an  audit committee financial expert  within the
definition of Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K.  

Nomination
Committee    

Our
Board of Directors does not maintain a nominating committee. As a result, no written charter governs the director nomination process.
Our size and the size of our Board, at this time, do not require a separate nominating committee.  

When
evaluating director nominees, our directors consider the following factors:  

-The
appropriate size of our Board of Directors;  

  -Our
needs with respect to the particular talents and experience of our directors;  

  -The
knowledge, skills and experience of nominees, including experience in finance, administration or  

  public
service, in light of prevailing business conditions and the knowledge, skills and experience already possessed by other members
of the Board;  

  -Experience
in political affairs;  

  -Experience
with accounting rules and practices; and  

  -The
desire to balance the benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective provided by new Board
members.  

Our
goal is to assemble a Board that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and professional
experience. In doing so, the Board will also consider candidates with appropriate non-business backgrounds.  

Other
than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although the Board may also consider such other
factors as it may deem are in our best interests as well as our stockholders. In addition, the Board identifies nominees by first
evaluating the current members of the Board willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience
that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of
the Board does not wish to continue in service or if the Board decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the Board
then identifies the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above. Current members of the Board
are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the criteria described above. The Board may also engage in research to identify
qualified individuals. To date, we have not engaged third parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees,
although we reserve the right in the future to retain a third party search firm, if necessary. The Board does not typically consider
