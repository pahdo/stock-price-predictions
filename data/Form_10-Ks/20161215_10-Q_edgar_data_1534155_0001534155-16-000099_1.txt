F-3             AMERI METRO, INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     OCTOBER 31, 2016     (Unaudited)         NOTE 1     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Nature of Business     Ameri Metro, Inc. (   Ameri Metro    and the    Company   ) was formed to engage primarily in high-speed rail for passenger and freight transportation and related transportation projects.  The Company initially intends to develop a Midwest high-speed rail system for passengers and freight.  Currently the Company is engaged in raising capital and entering into relationships in furtherance of its planned activities.   The Company   s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company   s business plan.     Basis of Presentation     The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (   SEC   ), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company   s financial statements filed with the SEC on Form 10K.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the consolidated financial statements to be not misleading have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year 2016 as reported in Form 10K, have been omitted.    NOTE 2    GOING CONCERN    These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated any revenues since inception and is unlikely to generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. As at October 31, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficiency of $18,017,313 and has accumulated losses of $23,548,278 since inception. The ability of Ameri Metro to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company generating cash from the sale of its common stock and/or obtaining debt financing and attaining future profitable operations.   Management   s plans include selling its equity securities and obtaining debt financing to fund its capital requirement and on-going operations; however, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company   s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.    NOTE 3     DUE TO RELATED PARTIES    At October 31, 2016, the Company is indebted to three directors of the Company for $1,050 (July 31, 2016 - $1,050) for expenditures incurred on behalf of the Company.  The amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.    NOTE 4     LOANS PAYABLE     RELATED PARTIES    As of October 31, 2016, $970,243 (July 31, 2016 - $960,967) is due to the majority shareholder, of which $508,531 is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand, $11,829 is past due with an interest rate of 3%, $57,767 is due December 31, 2016, with an interest at 3%, $95,600 is past due with an interest rate of 2%, $107,240 is due on March 1, 2017, with an interest rate of 7%, $180,000 is due on demand, with an interest rate of 4% and $9,276 is due on October 1, 2017, with an interest rate of 3%.  At October 31, 2016, accrued interest on these loans is $18,810 (July 31, 2016 - $14,068).    NOTE 5     LOAN PAYABLE    On January 30, 2014, the Company entered into a short-term loan with a non-related party.  The Company was loaned $6,000 from an investment company, the repayment terms are 3% interest with a maturity date of April 30, 2015.  The Company has repaid $2,597 as of October 31, 2016. At October 31, 2016, accrued interest on these loans is $303 (July 31, 2016 - $277). At October 31, 2016, this loan is past due.      NOTE 6     CAPITAL STOCK    On November 3, 2014, the Company effected a 4:1 forward stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a condition of the split, all shareholders who wanted to participate were required to send $100 to the Transfer Agent to pay for the expense related to reissuance of shares due to split. The cutoff date for the return of the notification and payment to the transfer agent was December 31, 2014. If the shareholder did not return the confirmation and payment, they would not be eligible to receive the additional shares.         F-4       As of the date of this filing 99.71% of the shareholders participated and therefore the statements are retroactively adjusted to reflect a 3.99:1 forward split. Due to 3.99:1 forward split the shares increased to 938,192,724, the shares issuable to effect a 4:1 split is 2,736,000.  As a result, all share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented for a 3.99:1 forward split.    On August 4, 2016 the Company issued 104,104 common shares to correct the amount of shares issued to a shareholder as a result of the forward stock split.

Since its incorporation, the Company has developed its business plan, appointed officers and directors, engaged initial project consultants and entered into negotiations and contracts for related and ancillary business. The Company is in the process of developing proposals for high-speed rail service.       The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware and merged with Ameri Metro 2010 on June 12, 2012.  References to the financial condition and performance of the Company below in this section    Management   s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation    are to financial statements of the Company.         BUSINESS         The Business        The Company (   ARMT   ) is focused on development of transportation facilities, including but not limited to high-speed rail for passenger and freight transportation and related and ancillary transportation businesses, inland ports, sea ports, airports, and toll roads. The Company intends to secure manufacturing and technologies together with ancillary land development projects, sale of goods and services to government, civilian and commercial end users.        The Company anticipates that it will, directly or through subsidiaries or affiliates, develop plans, and then coordinate and supervise the financing, construction and development of such transportation projects by bringing together the resources, plans, financing, approvals and technology needed to implement such transportation systems.           The Company has not yet commenced its revenue producing operations; however, it has been meeting with and making presentations to parties associated with projects it intends to develop, including parties in the United States related to a sea port and a rail project. The Company believes that the need, demand and usage of alternative transportation such as high speed rail, ports and toll roads are increasingly important as the United States adopts policies to attempt to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels and to improve its infrastructure and transportation systems. The Company intends to develop and prepare the designs and concepts for feasible and profitable regional transportation and infrastructure related projects utilizing existing and new infrastructure. The Company will prepare the complete project package including appraisals and estimates and will obtain contracts for the development of the facilities and infrastructure and purchase of the equipment. The Company will present the complete project, working as project supervisor and coordinator, to municipalities and regional government agencies.         Funding for individual projects of the Company will occur from bond offerings, as noted in herein incorporated by reference from the Form 8-K, dated 05/12/2016, as described in Exhibit 10.12 thru 10.44, organized through various nonprofit entities, High Speed Rail Facilities Inc., High Speed Rail Facilities Provider Inc., Alabama Toll Facilities Inc., Global Infrastructure Finance   Development Authority Inc. and organizations sponsored or affiliated with municipal and government agencies as well as from         11       issuances of stock and debt-financing.  Certain of these nonprofit entities or organizations may themselves be affiliated with, or related to, the Company and assist, or work in conjunction with, the Company in securing contracts and funds to develop projects.

Business Plan        The Company will facilitate the development of transportation facilities, including but not limited to high-speed rail for passenger and freight transportation and related and ancillary transportation businesses, inland ports, sea ports, airports, and toll roads. The Company intends to secure manufacturing and technologies together with ancillary land development projects, sale of goods and services to government, civilian and commercial end users.  The high-speed rail plan to be presented by the Company will likely utilize existing rail rights-of-way to connect several metropolitan areas and states serving expanding populations.        Funding for individual projects of the Company will occur from bond offerings, as noted in herein incorporated by reference from the Form 8-K, dated 05/12/2016, as described in Exhibit 10.12 thru 10.44, organized through various nonprofit entities, High Speed Rail Facilities Inc., High Speed Rail Facilities Provider Inc., Alabama Toll Facilities Inc., Global Infrastructure Finance   Development Authority Inc. and organizations sponsored or affiliated with municipal and government agencies as well as from issuances of stock and debt-financing.  Certain of these nonprofit entities or organizations may themselves be affiliated with, or related to, the Company and assist, or work in conjunction with, the Company in securing contracts and funds to develop projects.  The major elements of the plan would include:        High Speed Rail        Introduction of modern rail equipment operating at speeds up to 250 mph       Use of existing rail rights-of-way to connect rural, small urban and major metropolitan areas       Track improvement, including replacement and upgrades, additional sidings, signal and communications systems, and grade-crossing improvements       Construction or improvement of railroad grade crossings and passenger stations       Acquiring new train equipment including train sets and spares        Supporting Ancillary Development        Development or expansion of a feeder bus system linking outlying areas to railroad stations       Operation of a "hub-and-spoke" passenger rail system providing service to and through one or more major hubs to locations throughout the United States       Provision of multi-modal connections to improve system access, hotels, retail, parking garages, sorting facilities / distribution facilities     14        Supporting Transportation Systems        Ancillary development opportunities, airports, inland ports, sea ports, toll roads and technology parks       The following discussion outlines the steps as the Company anticipates that will occur in regard to the adoption and implementation of a high-speed rail system by a regional or local municipality.  To date, the Company has not developed any rail systems.        The Company plans that it will prepare the feasibility study and locate contractors and manufacturers to complete and work and provide cost estimates. Because highspeed rail travel is already inplace in much of Europe and Asia, the Company anticipates working with European companies to furnish the highspeed equipment, such as locomotives and passenger cars.       The Company will put proposed contracts together with the supporting feasibility study, appraisals, cost/benefit analysis, TEMS study, transportation history and other data to create a complete regional project proposal.  The Company will then present such project proposals to the municipalities (state or local) as a complete and finished project. The local or regional municipality will then independently analyze and discuss the Company's proposal.  If accepted, the Company anticipates that, upon approval, the local municipality will effectuate a bond offering for the funding of the high-speed rail project.  The Company anticipates that the projects will be financed by bonds or indentures offered by sponsored or affiliated non-profit organizations of the applicable local or municipal government or agency.  Such non-profit entities may also be affiliates or companies related to the Company.       Once a proposed high-speed rail project is accepted and a financing bond issue is effected by the municipality, the Company will act as the project manager and oversee the entire project including not only the development of the project but its continued operations as well. The Company will also serve as the main central point for coordination of and between the municipalities, contractors, and operators of the project and, once established, the rail system.        Hi Speed Rail Facilities, Inc.    In 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with HSRF (one of the Company's related nonprofit companies) for the purpose of construction of projects consisting of the financing, construction and operation of high speed rail and related projects across the United States. HSRF is designed to focus on the building of train tracks and stations.  Pursuant to the agreement between the Company and HSRF, the Company will act as the agent and representative of HSRF to perform all required tasks and actions to develop and construct such projects. The Company anticipates that having this agreement in place and by having HSRF already organized will expedite the process of commencing a project once the Company designs and develops and secures or raises funds to commence a project.        Hi Speed Rail Facilities Provider, Inc.    In 2010, the Company entered into a written agreement with HSRFP (one of the Company's related nonprofit companies) for the purpose of construction of projects consisting of the financing, construction and operation of various high speed rail and related projects across the United States. Pursuant to such agreement between the Company and HSRFP, the Company was appointed as the agent and representative of HSRFP to perform all required tasks and actions to develop and construct such projects. HSRFP was organized to provide a vehicle to issue bonds and help secure infrastructure projects for the Company focusing on facilities ancillary to the high speed rail such as rail yards rail, rail assembly plants maintenance facilities. The Company anticipates that having this agreement in place and by having HSRF already organized will expedite the process of commencing a project once the Company secures or raises funds to commence a project.        Master Trust Indenture Agreement    On December 1, 2010, HSRF entered into a Master Trust Indenture agreement providing that HSRF serve as trustee for a bond offering of $15,000,000,000 of HSRF Revenue Bonds Series 2010. In April 2012 this Indenture was amended to reflect a Master Indenture of $20,000,000,000. The Company will act as developer for the project financed by the Hi Speed Indenture. The Master Trust Indenture provides the basic terms and conditions of any bond issuance such as use of an escrow agent, rights of bond holders, sale of bonds, etc.           ING Investment Management     Each of the nonprofits has entered into an investment management agreement with ING Investment Management to manage any funds raised in bond offerings and to provide its investment advisory services.  This non-binding agreement would only take effect upon the raising of revenues bonds.  ING Investment Management would serve to invest, reinvest and supervise the management of any such funds while such funds were held in an investment account and until use for the intended purposes.     15        Alabama Toll Road     Mobile (ATFI Alabama Toll Road Facility Inc.) Intermodal Corridor research Review Team      Team Member   Affiliation         Dr. Mark Burton, PhD         University of Tennessee         Dr. David Clarke, PhD   University of Tennessee         Mr. Rick Tucker   Port of Huntsville, AL         Mr. Jimmy Lyons   Port of Mobile, AL         Dr. Craig Phillip, PhD   Vanderbilt University         Dr. Ted Grossardt, PhD   University of Kentucky         Mr. Kent Sowards   Marshall University         Dr. Mike Hicks, PhD   Ball State University       Mr. Scott Hercik   Appalachian Regional Commission   The Company is working to develop a project to build a toll road in the State of Alabama, per Resolution SJR-56 by Legislature of State of Alabama and is in the process of raising funding. In 2010, the Company was developing this project at the time of the merger with Yellowwood. The planned toll road is designated as a 352 mile 4-lane road designed to be built from Orange Beach, Alabama to the Tennessee state line with the intent of connecting various rural sections of Alabama to Tennessee and more urban areas. The toll road that would connect various rural sections of Alabama to Tennessee and with its more urban areas.       As its first step, Alabama Toll Facilities, Inc. (ATFI) was created and obtained status as a nonprofit corporation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  As a nonprofit corporation, ATFI is allowed to make bond offerings in order to finance the cost of acquisition and construction and equipping of the toll road project.  Mr. Shah Mathias (the founder of the Company) was one of the directors of ATFI and has subsequently resigned his position.       In 2007, the toll road project was presented to the Alabama legislature which on June 7, 2007, adopted Act no. 2007-506 entitled "Expressing Support for the Alabama Toll Road Project".  This Act stated that it recognized the need to utilize other financial resources to meet the needs of that highways and other infrastructure items such as that offered by ATFI. The Act urged approval of the bonds offered by ATFI as special revenue bonds with the project eventually vesting to the state upon retirement of the bonds.  The Act further supports designating ATFI as the exclusive entity for creation and development of the toll road project.       As a second step, on September 23, 2009, Penndel Land Company (   Penndel   ), a company wholly owned by Shah Mathias entered into an agreement with ATFI by which Penndel was appointed as the agent and representative of ATFI to perform all required tasks and actions to develop and construct the toll road.         Thirdly, on December 1, 2010, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Global Transportation   Infrastructure, Inc. ("GTI") in the state of Delaware to provide development and construction services for the Alabama highway project and to include securing financing for the design, planning, engineering and related costs of construction.       In December 2010, Penndel assigned its agreements with ATFI to GTI. As such the Company, through its subsidiary, GTI, has the development rights for such toll road. Under the terms of the agreement, GTI will provide development and construction services. GTI will also act as an agent and representative to take actions necessary to secure the first and future phases of the financing applicable to the design, planning, engineering and related soft and hard costs of the construction of a toll road in the state of Alabama and related activities.        Alabama Indenture Agreement    On December 1, 2010, ATFI entered into a Master Trust Indenture agreement with as HSRF Trustee, which has agreed to serve as the trustee for the bond offering of up to $7,000,000,000 of ATFI Revenue Bonds once it determines to effect such an offering if ever. The Alabama Indenture indicates that the developer for the project will be GTI.  In April 2012 the Alabama Indenture was amended to reflect a Master Indenture of $20,000,000,000.  The Master Agreement provides the basic terms and conditions of any bond issuance such as use of an escrow agent, rights of bond holders, sale of bonds, etc. At the time that any bonds are to be issued, the Company will engage an asset manager and trustee for the indenture.     16            ARMT (ATFI Alabama Toll Road Facility Inc.)    1   Introduction   The purpose of this    Investment Grade    study is to evaluate the potential for developing the Mobile Trade and Transport Corridor, as an adjunct to Port Mobile to serve as a major container port for a hinterland corridor between the Appalachians in the east, and the Mississippi in the west, and stretching as far north as the markets of mid-America including Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The area is largely served today by West Coast Ports that rely on relatively expensive rail and truck shipments to these inland markets, but are low cost due to the large ships that can access West Coast Ports. With the opening of the Panama Canal, and the access of large ships to the Gulf of Mexico, the Mobile corridor has the potential to provide a less expensive and more effective way of serving these markets.  See Exhibits 1 and 2.        The reason for this is that the Port of Mobile is one of the very few ports on the gulf and the east coast of the US that can serve the very large ships (50 foot depth) that will be able to access the gulf and east coasts with the opening of the Panama Canal. Once the Port is dredged, this will reduce the Maritime costs to the Port of Mobile significantly (i.e., 50 percent) and shift the competitive balance from West Coast Ports to the Port of Mobile.         Exhibit 1: Potential Port of Mobile Hinterland with Post-Panamax Max Ships             17        Exhibit 2: Mobile Trade  (ATFI Alabama Toll Road Facility Inc.)    Transport Corridor: Population and Required Linkage     ARMT is proposing that new infrastructure be developed at the Port of Mobile, and for inland access to the markets that may be served by the Port of Mobile in the future. The new infrastructure will include a new toll highway, a freight rail line from the Port of Mobile to Inland Ports at key locations in the Trade and Transport Corridor, and a cargo airport to expand the capabilities of the corridor to include air freight similar to the airport in Alliance, Texas.       To assess the potential for the Mobile Trade and Transport Corridor, ARMT has asked Transportation Economics   Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS) to prepare a scope of work that will provide the business case for the project. The project will answer the following questions           What is the business case for investing in rail along Mobile Trade and Transport Corridor?       How will the Port of Mobile and the communities along the Trade and Transport Corridor benefit?       Can the private sector play a role in developing the corridor, and what financial returns will be generated?       How can Port of Mobile support the development of Inland Ports in serving the hinterland and trade market?       What are the kinds and sources of private funding (revenue, loans, grants, bonds, letters of credit, etc.) that can be obtained to support and develop the project?     2   Study Approach   The purpose of the Business Plan study is to assess at an Investment Grade level of detail, the market opportunities, physical facility needs, financial and economic returns, business arrangements and implementation timeline for developing the Mobile Trade and Transport Corridor as a trade corridor for Port of Mobile between Port Mobile and inland markets.       In carrying out its initial review, TEMS has already shown there is a prima facia case for the investment.  However, the review was based on an analysis using existing data and models including the Panama Canal Route Choice model and the National Ports model.  Both models need updating to 2016 to reflect the post 2008 recession economy and the latest changes in the development of the Panama Canal, US Ports, and marine economics.             18       In addition, the preliminary study made a number of assumptions about the institutional structures that would be adopted by the Port and Railroads.  In the Business Plan phase these assumptions need to be evaluated and as appropriate adjustments made to accommodate the findings of direct discussions with the key stakeholders.       Finally, the upgraded market analysis and institutional assumptions will be used to develop a more detailed implementation plan, financial and funding plan, and economic cost benefit and impact plan. The financial and funding plan will develop the cash flows for the project, and the timing and sources of funds needed to complete the project.  The economic analysis will show the benefits to the communities in the Trade and Transport Corridor. The analysis will produce both the Cost Benefit Analysis required by USDOT, as well as the economic impact for the region associated with job creation, increased income, property development, and tax base enhancement.  This can be used to develop community outreach in communities along the corridor and at local and state level, to explain the costs and benefits of developing the corridor.        In undertaking this analysis TEMS will use its six step Business Planning process.  The process is shown in Exhibit 3.  For this Feasibility Study TEMS will refine the more aggregate level of analysis that was used for the preliminary study.  This will include updating the trade and traffic data that derives the forecasts, working to resolve institutional issues and ensuring the practicality of the proposed implementation process.                    Step 1     Market Assessment        For the Business Plan analysis, TEMS will update the market data developed by TEMS for the Panama Canal, Gulf Coast Port Study, West Coast Port Study, and National Ports Model.  The data will be brought to a 2016 basis in order to identify the market potential for the Mobile Trade and Transport Corridor. This will be done using the TEMS GOODS    multimodal freight model.  The new database of socioeconomic data, marine markets, vessel economics, inland markets and competitive inland transport networks will be updated using the latest Port statistics, updated inland transportation data, and changes in mode competition due to oil prices, congestion and fuel efficiency.        The feasibility study will use the TEMS GOODS    model framework (Exhibit 4), which is designed to analyze freight traffic flows at an International, Regional and Local level.     19            Exhibit 4: GOODS    Model Structure            As can be seen in Exhibit 4, the database includes not just O/D data, transport mode networks and socioeconomic data, but in addition stated preference data on shipper choices.  This data is critical in deciding how shippers select routes, modes, and carriers.  The current data was developed in 2006 for the Panama Canal and USDOT inland shipping studies.  This will be reviewed and updated to provide insight into six types of container traffic     Raw Materials, Furniture, Food, Industrial Products, Finished Products, and Electronics/Computers.  Each type of container traffic will be modeled separately as each type of traffic has a different shipper response. See Exhibit 5.            The GOODS    model allocates traffic to modes using a metric that reflects shipper and carrier behavior in the face of different mode and service options. A critical factor in the metric is Values of Time that are different by different commodities value added content         20       (i.e., highest for electronics lowest for raw lowest materials). It provides a mechanism for estimating market share traffic volumes and revenue potential for each element of the traffic movement. Values of Time will be updated to 2016 values.       Forecasts will be prepared using both the economic growth forecasts and changes in transport infrastructure in the Port of Mobile and the other Gulf Ports, and the market shares of the Gulf versus both West and East coast ports.       The market analysis will be used to identify rail traffic from the Port of Mobile along the Trade and Transport Corridor for horizon years 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050.  The traffic analysis will be summarized in terms of short, medium and long term opportunities.        Step 2     Service Scenario Definition    In the second step, the Business Plan will seek to define in more detail than in the concept study the most appropriate form of port, rail, highway and air infrastructure and development strategies that might be developed for the Port of Mobile and the Trade and Transport Corridor.  Using specific market data on the potential market pairs, service needs, and the potential types of water, truck and rail operations in terms of performance and cost, an Interactive Analysis will be completed that assesses the relationship between market volumes, water, rail and truck service development options for the Port Freeport and Inland distribution networks. A key factor in this analysis will be the level of institutional cooperation that can be achieved between the communities along the route and transportation stakeholders. Specific discussions will be held with the freight railroads to identify mutually satisfactory solutions in the development of the corridor. From the evaluation of these options the analysis will identify the most effective traffic potential, intermodal interface needs, port to port services, and potential schedules and tariffs.       Exhibit 6 shows the Interactive Analysis process. It can be seen that data on the marine and inland transport distribution systems and on the market is required to identify the character of the transport operations that can be provided in the Mobile Trade and Transport Corridor.  The analysis uses three TEMS    programs: LOCOMOTION   , SWITCH-IT    and GOODS    to evaluate the Trade-offs between alternatives.        Exhibit 6: Interactive Analysis Process     Port and Infrastructure needs to service the Mobile Trade and Transport Corridor will be identified and their operating and capital costs estimated in 2015 dollars.  The cost estimates generated in the concept study will be subject to detailed review in terms of both their engineering requirements, as well as potential environmental issues. An environmental scan will be completed to endure that environmental issues can be mitigated and that no    fatal flaws    exist in the development of the corridor.   The Engineering feasibility for the study will build on the earlier port and market studies and analysis and will create a representative alignment (highway, rail, airport), between Port of Mobile and its hinterland, solely for the purpose of assessing the feasibility of the project. Civil, structural and operational engineering requirements for construction of the highway and rail project, and likely related infrastructure costs, will be developed for the representative alignments. Roadway network improvements necessary due to the project will also be analyzed.  The overall analysis will include consideration of whether the project can be executed and operated safely, rail geometry issues, and the environmental feasibility of the project with a view towards the ability to secure the required licenses, approvals and permits in a timely and cost effective way.     Furthermore, the timing of infrastructure needs will be assessed to ensure that it is timed to relate to changing traffic conditions, which could well occur in the next five to ten years due to the Panama Canal. The impact of the proposed improvements in Port Mobile         21       services and the Trade and Transport Corridor for truck and rail will then be compared to other major Gulf ports and used in estimating the potential market that the Port can capture.   Development of a new rail line in the Trade and Transport Corridor as part of the national rail network will fall under the jurisdiction of the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB).  Under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the STB must take into account the environmental impacts of its actions, including direct, indirect and cumulative impacts.  The STB's environmental rules are specified in 49 CFR 1105. These rules implement various environmental statutes that include NEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act.  STB requirements for environmental documentation and historic reports as detailed in the following link: http://www.stb.dot.gov/stb/environment/rules_guide.html.       The development of the toll road will come under direction of FHWA and Alabama State DOT and will need to meet their applicable regulatory standards.       As a feasibility-level assessment, the current study must complete an Environmental Scan that will anticipate and identify potential environmental issues. The environmental scan will include a preliminary consideration of at least the following areas:   o   Natural/Biological Resources   o   Water Resources/Wetlands   o   Land Use   o   Geology and Soils   o   Recreation   o   Noise and Vibration   o   Cultural/Paleontological Resources   o   Environmental Justice   An environmental constraints map will be created for the project area that identifies the major environmental areas of concern.  This constraints map will be created using publicly available data and the study team   s knowledge of the project area.  The representative alignment will be laid out such that is does not have any fatal flaws due to environmental impacts.  Lesser impacts due to the representative alignment will be used as the basis for the mitigation costs associated with the project.       The Feasibility Study will not include public outreach other than with key Project stakeholders, but the feasibility study should reasonably anticipate likely community concerns.        Finally, the analysis will define the most effective way to develop both water services and inland distribution services, by assessing their performance in both financial and economic terms. Specifically, an analysis will be made of different water services to and between Mobile and other ports, and specifically the role of COB services. From the evaluation of options the most effective development plan for the Port of Mobile and the Trade and Transport Corridor will be derived. In developing the service plan, the analysis will also recognize and consider existing and potential institutional, fiscal, and policy issues that are fundamental to the success of the project.        A key element of the Business Plan assessment will be that the study teams work closely with important stakeholders such as the shippers to ensure they are comfortable with the basic concepts, market forecasts, and Port of Mobile service proposals. It is important to achieve    buy-in    from the freight shippers, railroads and carriers, and to identify their needs in meeting the Port of Mobile proposals. This includes competitive highway and rail service to and from the port, the character of water services from and to the Port of Mobile, and the line and yard capacity issues for rail, highway facilities and services, The rail capacity issues will be identified using the MISS-IT    and SWITCH-IT    models. As required, highway and rail infrastructure capacity needs and potential funding will be addressed. The service plan as finally developed will include contingencies to manage issues affecting its implementation.        Step 3     Traffic and Revenue Assessment    A traffic and revenue yield assessment will be completed to optimize the tariff systems for the final service plan for highway and rail. For each level of service, the market data and the service plan will be used to derive revenue estimates that reflect the supply and demand conditions that will exist. By providing an analysis of tariffs to the Trade and Transport Corridor in relation to the supply and demand conditions (i.e., the affordability of the tariff to truck companies and the freight railroads), a final set of traffic volumes and revenues can be derived. These tariffs, when applied to the market, will optimize revenues and provide the key input to the financial model used to assess the potential of the Corridor. The proposed tariffs will be discussed with the trucking companies and freight railroads to identify the value they place on the improvements offered by the Trade and Transport Corridor.        Step 4     Implementation Plan Analysis    In the fourth step, the market analysis, service plan and tariff structures developed in Steps 1 through 3 will be used to define the specific infrastructure, land uses, and development proposals for the Trade and Transport Corridor. The analysis will identify these critical inputs/costs             22              Port infrastructure,        Rail infrastructure,       Airport facilities,       Highway infrastructure,       Inland port potential,       Terminal facilities,        Bulk and car load rail traffic,       Maintenance facilities,        Interface access systems for truck and rail traffic,    A financial and economic evaluation process will assess financial return and economic benefits. The financial analysis will assess highway, truck and auto tolls, and freight railroad container and car load traffic and provide an assessment of needed facilities. These assessments will include net present value, internal rate of return, payback period, debt coverage and financial risk.  A quantitative risk analysis risk analysis will identify key elements that could impact the financial return on the project. As the process develops, specific requirements will be developed for the Port of Mobile and the Trade and Transport Corridor and the revenue process will be examined to maximize the financial and economic success of the project.   In the economic analysis an evaluation will be made in the Cost Benefit returns of the project to the public, ports, highway operations, and freight railroads. This will be supplemented by a RENTS    analysis of the jobs, income, property values, and tax base enhancement that would result from the project.    At the end of Step 4, the preliminary Implementation Plan will be developed, defining the milestones and components for implementing the Trade and Transport Corridor infrastructure.    Step 5     Financing and Funding Plan    In Step 5, the aim will be to develop a full financing framework and funding plan for the project will be defined to include potential public-private partnerships, franchise potentials and others. The role of funding sources in terms of both the public and private sector will be assessed and a variety of creative financing and funding programs will be considered. Specific consideration will be given to the appropriate institutional structures for the operation and the needs of stakeholders. As required, specific cost sharing arrangements will be developed between federal, state, ports, shippers and the freight railroads. As appropriate, cost-sharing arrangements will be thoroughly defined and various cost allocation, procedures proposed.        During this step, Institutional arrangements agreements will be discussed, developed, and delivered to the partners for their acceptance. A Risk Analysis will identify key factors and issues associated with the different strategic options.        Step 6     Business Plan    In Step 6, a Feasibility Business Plan will be finalized that will bring together the various sub-plans and agreements that have been developed as part of Steps 1 through 5. The Feasibility Business Plan will include              Market Analysis       Operating and Service Plans       Capital and Operating Costs       Environmental Requirements       Land use Requirements       Financial Plan       Funding Plan       Implementation plan       The Business Plan will guide and support the key stakeholders throughout the implementation and financing activities of the incremental rail project. Capital needs, operating costs and potential revenues will be identified. This plan will set out a development proposals and investment program to support as necessary the provisions of updated Port of Mobile infrastructure, Trade and Transport Corridor, rail, highway, air infrastructure, a full multimodal    Inland Port    facility to facilitate traffic movement by truck, rail, air, and water out of and into the Port of Mobile hinterland. This development will require full financial and economic justification and an understanding of the contribution the facility can make to the Texas economy in terms of jobs, income and transfer payments like tax base expansion and additional rents and fees.            23           3   Resources    Time Line:  The work will take nine months to complete, and will involve eight meetings and presentations as shown in Exhibit 1, as the study proceeds. It is proposed that the Appalachian Regional Council (ARC) will set up a study advisory team that will meet with the study team at four workshops, where TEMS will present the work of the project and discuss key assumptions, issues, and input scenarios and strategies with the study team.         Study Cost:  The study will cost $500,000 to complete including out of pocket travel costs.  Out of pocket travel costs will be billed as a direct expense.         4   Work Plan      Mobile Trade (ATFI Alabama Toll Road Facility Inc.) and Transport Corridor Work Plan        Mobile (ATFI Alabama Toll Road Facility Inc.)

The Company entered into a contract for the acquisition of the patents, rights, titles, and business of Damar Corporation LLC, the inventor, developer and manufacturer of Damar TruckDeck. (See www.damartruckdeck.com). The Damar Corporation was incorporated in 2007 to develop, manufacture and market the truck deck component invented and developed by its owner. The Damar Corporation has filed a patent application covering its truck deck system. The Damar TruckDeck is a flexible truck deck storage and organization system that with an integrated frame allowing the cargo deck to be used as a hauling surface. The system has many configurations to fit a wide variety of uses (hunting, construction, moving, hauling, etc.) in various truck deck sizes. The Damar TruckDeck primarily consists of lockable repositionable storage units.       The Company cannot effect this agreement until its raises the funds necessary to the acquisition of such assets as listed in the agreement.            24       In October 2014, HSR Technology, Inc. as the equitable owner of four tax parcels located within West Manchester Township, York, PA filed a request for landowner curative amendment with the local township, with the intent of constructing facilities on the properties for the fabrication, assembly and welding of steel, aluminum and stainless steel assemblies with no foundry or casting operations. The use will include the fabrication and assembly of composite rebar, composite rail, bed liners and rail car assemblies received pre-prepared. The rail access is critical to the procurement of the land, as the products manufactured on site will be directly related to the company purpose of creating global economic development and promoting trade by bringing people together through innovative ideas and advanced technology.  HSR Technology, Inc. proposes the initial construction of a transfer and storage building with a rail siding into the building. Manufacturing and assembly buildings would be added in stages, eventually employing up to 2,800 workers.        Port Trajan Project    The Port Trajan 5 project is a transportation project located in the Antrim Township, Greencastle, Pennsylvania on the Interstate 81 corridor and the railroad "Crescent Corridor", a 2,500 mile network of rail and terminals.  Norfolk Southern is operating a rail-truck facility in this corridor and the State of Pennsylvania has provided funding toward the development of additional facilities along this corridor.  The Company envisions the development of the land next to such corridor, which it has termed the Port Trajan Project.  The Company anticipates that it will construct a distribution center consisting of a terminal and a rail line between the main rail track to the highway for the transition of shipping containers from the rail line to waiting trucks.  The distribution center will provide the facility for repackaging the shipments into containers or other shipments destined for final destination by truck.         The Company anticipates that such project will be completed in phases the first of which is the purchase of an initial 345 acres at $350,000 per acre.  The purchase price will include all on-site horizontal improvements.  Off-site improvements will be acquired at an additional $20,000,000. The land is currently owned by a related company and the Company has entered into a letter of intent for its purchase.       On January 9, 2013, the Company signed a letter of intent with a related party to purchase land for a potential future project.  The Company was unable to meet the deposit requirements of this contract, and so in November 2013 the deposit requirements were amended to require a cash deposit of $1,000 to hold the purchase option open for the Company until institutional funding is acquired.  Future plans are to issue in excess of 10,000,000 shares of common stock to aid in funding the land purchase.  As of January 31, 2016, the $1,000 has been deposited on this contract.        On January 13, 2013, the Company entered into a Letter of Intent with a related party to contract services for the build out of the Port Trajan 5 Terminals.             On February 19, 2014, the Company entered into a Master Agreement for Production Services with Platinum Media whereby Platinum Media will provide the Company with all of its media development needs for a 5 year term. The agreement states that the fees charged to the Company will be no less than $12,000,000 per year. As of December 5, 2016, the Company has not been charged by Platinum Media. The parties agreed to amend the agreement with no accruing payments.             INTRODUCTION: THE DEMAND FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE     The United States Census Bureau predicts that the American population will reach 420 million by 2050, a trend that will overwhelm our nation   s transportation infrastructure.       Current estimates suggest that overall freight demand will double over the next 40 years from 15 billion tons today to 30 billion tons. The number of trucks on the road is also expected to double. Already under unsustainable strain, the nation   s freight transportation infrastructure and highways will face even greater challenges as the total volume of freight increases.       Extensive infrastructure expansion, such as new ports, trade corridors and high-speed rail (HSR), is critical if rail and road transportation is to help mitigate problems associated with rising fuel costs, crowded highways, and greenhouse gas emissions. Population growth and development in the U.S. have made our nation increasingly reliant on rail and highway infrastructure to transport people and freight.       Clearly, a strong, efficient freight transportation system is vital to the nation   s economy. Our already-strained and out-dated railways must be upgraded to handle the projected increases in freight shipping to relieve congestion on our highways. New Trade corridors are needed to support the changes in marine shipping that will need new ports and infrastructure. Equally, new high speed rail routes are needed to increase connectivity between US cities and support the emerging new economy, and reduce auto emissions.   We are focusing on the following means to create efficient freight transportation:       25             Increase port capacity to increase our nation   s ability to distribute goods, making us more competitive in the global economy.          Develop larger, rail-served, inland distribution centers that will encourage more efficient movement of goods and create more capacity at ports.         Permit increased volume and speed of inland heavy freight, allowing inland distribution points to expand into larger, national service hubs and promote economic growth.         Develop profitable high speed rail for the fast movement of people and goods.   ARMT   s assets will consist of five critical areas of ownership agreements and expertise, as well as specific facilities and product patterns. The key areas are           I.   Projects: Ten project corridors to be developed   II.   Industrial products to be used in the development process   III.   Franchise Opportunities   IV.   Partnerships and agreements   V.   Management team    1. Projects          1.1   PORT TRAJAN DEVELOPMENT     1,122 ACRES NEXT TO CSX/NS YARDS BETWEEN HARRISBURG AND HAGERSTOWN         Estimated Cost of project: $1 Billion   This land is at the center of the Harrisburg   Hagerstown Logistics Center. Once developed Port Trajan will be a transportation multimodal hub and logistics center located in Antrim Township, Greencastle, Pennsylvania on the Interstate 81 Corridor and the intersection of the CSX and NS freight railroad    Crescent Corridor   , and 2,500 mile network of rail and terminals from Pennsylvania to Alabama. Both CSX and NS are developing rail-truck facilities in this corridor. ARMT envisages developing its land holdings to provide a distribution center consisting of terminals with rail connections to NS and CSX facilities. The terminals will be used for    stuffing    and repackaging rail containers (40 foot) to truck (52 foot) containers, storage and warehousing, and truck distribution.         1.2   PORT MOBILE AND ALABAMA CORRIDOR TOLL ROAD AND RAIL ROAD          Estimated Cost of project: $10 Billion   ARMT, Inc. has contracted for the rights to build a 350-mile toll road and railroad connecting Orange Beach, Port of Mobile and Huntsville Trade corridor. The corridor can be developed to Memphis, Indianapolis/Chicago, Cincinnati, and Columbus. Development of corridor to include urban areas, airport, and terminal facilities. The Port of Mobile will be improved to take the large ships capable of using the Panama Canal. It will be connected to Inland Ports and airports at locations along the corridor including Huntsville, AL, Memphis, TN, Birmingham, AL, Louisville, KY, Knoxville, TN to Columbus, OH. The project has the support of Appalachian Regional Council and specific government development agreements with the state of Alabama.       The Alabama Toll Road Facility Inc. (ATFI) as a non-profit corporation has been granted tax exempt status under the Title 26 U.S.C. 501(C)(3) for the purpose of the project. The project will be financed by tax exempt bonds issued in accordance with the joint resolutions of the Alabama House and Senate.

The existing   transportation and distribution infrastructure in the South has been identified as   insufficient to meet the anticipated demand over the next several decades. The   ARMT team has developed a plan to meet the demands of the future   and to combat the existing distribution shortfalls by creating the most elaborate   multi-modal distribution system the world has ever seen.       The aerotropolis will be located in west-central Alabama approximately half way between the Gulf of Mexico and the Tennessee border. High speed rail, freight rail and a toll road will connect the aerotropolis with the port to the south and connections to high density population centers to the north.             27       The airport component of the aerotropolis has been envisioned to accommodate the next generation of mega-sized aircraft that have not yet even been designed. Many airports around the world are finding it difficult to handle the largest aircraft that are currently in service such as the Airbus A380. Most of the existing airports around the world are constrained by physical barriers that inhibit their ability to expand to accommodate the massive size of the aircraft that operate today. This will not be an issue at KSJM. The airport will have four parallel runways 18,000 feet long and 250 feet wide as well as a crosswind runway measuring 12,000 feet long and 250 feet wide. Design criteria for the taxiway system, aircraft parking areas and the runways have been planned to accommodate the new large aircraft of today as well as the next generation aircraft of tomorrow.

The aim would be to provide high speed frequent rail service that would provide improved mobility for people and goods and at the same time provide an operating profit. The project would be developed as either a freestanding enterprise or a public-private partnership (PPP) with an array of public and private support for the project. Feasibility study for the corridor has been completed by TEMS.   Atlanta to Birmingham High Speed Train Corridor           1.5   HIGH SPEED RAIL CORRIDOR     PITTSBURGH TO PHILADELPHIA          Estimated Cost of project: $2 Billion   ARMT is in negotiations with the state of Pennsylvania to create a Public-Private Partnership to take over High Speed Rail operations between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The project will seek to significantly upgrade the route and train speeds to create a profitable operation for the movement of people and parcels that can be franchised to ARMT High Speed Rail Operations Company.             29           1.6   TEXAS TRADE CORRIDOR     PORT FREEPORT/SH 36A         Estimated Cost of project: $2.5     $3.0 Billion   This project would be similar to the Mobile Trade and Transport Corridor. The project would provide Texas with a Gulf port (Port Freeport) with 50 feet of water capable of taking the large ships that will use the recently expanded Panama Canal. Port Freeport would serve the Dallas-Fort Worth market, which is the third largest Logistics Center in the US after Los Angeles and New York/New Jersey. The project would combine port improvements of Freeport with a new 65-mile greenfield route from the port to give more direct access to both BNSF and UP routes to the Dallas   Fort Worth market. TEMS has completed feasibility and Business Planning studies for the corridor. It is anticipated that Athe Company would be supported by local investors and equity partners.    Texas Trade and Transportation Corridor After Panama Canal Expansion                 22         1.7   PORTUS DE JEWEL PORT        Portus De-Jewel Mexico:  The Portus De- Jewel Mexico, the new premier gateway for international commerce, is located approximately 600 miles south of Yuma Arizona Intermodal Port along the Mexican coast line. The Portus De- Jewel Mexico encompasses 176,000 acres of land and water along 26 miles of waterfront. It features 40 passenger and 384 cargo terminals, including automobile, breakbulk, container, dry and liquid bulk, multi-use, and warehouse facilities that handle billions of dollars    worth of cargo each year.       The Portus De-Jewel Mexico consist 64 shipping/receiving berths at lengths of 15,000 ft. each.  The total number of ships berthed at one time is 320 ships.  The water depth is constant at 55 ft.    Portus De-Jewel Mexico expects it will be able to accept the following economic base from Port of Los Angeles:          1.1 million jobs          $89.2 billion in California trade value          $223 billion in U.S. trade value         $5.1 billion in state tax revenue         $21.5 billion in federal tax revenue          Port customers contribute about $760 million to the local economy.     Economic Impact        We will intercept shipments going to the Los Angeles Port at approximately $500 billion dollars per year.        Port customers will contribute approximately $27.8 billion dollars per year to the local economy within the Portus De-Jewel Mexico complex.  The Port contributes substantially to the economy, in part, through the following activities:    Port Industries         30       Port industries are businesses involved in the moving and handling of maritime cargo.        Dollars:  For every dollar spent by port industries - another 97 cents is generated in indirect and induced sales in the region.         Jobs:  Accounts for approximately 32,000 direct port industry jobs (85% of which are trucking and warehousing jobs).     Port Users    The biggest contributors to the economy, port users, are businesses that use the Port to receive imports or ship exports. Export manufacturers are major port users. Other port users include local manufacturers who process imported unfinished goods.        Dollars:  Port users generate approximately $12.1 billion and stimulate an additional $5.5 billion in local industry indirect sales. Local "re-spending" by workers employed by port users and the industries they impact amount to approximately $4.1 billion. Each dollar of spending for port user goods and services produces about 79 cents of additional industry sales in the region.     Port Customers    Port customers are the retail and other non-cargo businesses in the Port. They are most important to communities near the Port as a source of jobs, recreation and specialty consumer goods.          Jobs:  Direct jobs associated with port customers numbered about 6,400 or roughly half of the jobs actually    located in the Port. For every one of these port customer jobs, nearly 1.7 additional jobs are created elsewhere in the region.

Industrial Products          2.1   INTRODUCTION         A  RMT   plans to develop projects as opportunities are   presented, related or   ancillary to the transportation or transportation-related fields  .          HSR Technologies  ,   Inc  .   is a related party of A  RMT.          HSR Technologies  ,   Inc. as the        equitable Owner/Developer        has secured certain properties by agreement with the intent of constructing manufacturing facilities on the properties for the following: Fabrication  , a  ssembly and welding of; steel, aluminum and stainless steel with no foundry or casting operations.          HSR Technologies  ,   Inc. has chosen the properties in question for industrial development after an extensive search of York County properties.          The requirements for the proposed development proposed  were:      The property has 449+/- acres which will allow for the development area needed while providing future expansion capabilities  .   Rail service is critical to the business model, which is based on rail use  .   The site in question has 3  ,  600 linear feet of rail line traversing it and provides ample areas fo  r   siding access. Access to major roadways is a critical component of any manufacturing use  .   The subject properties have direct access to an arterial road  ,   West College Avenue  ,   a state road  ;   a collector road  ,   Hokes Mill Road, also a state road  ;   and three local roads  ,   offering many potential points of access. Also, the site is within 2200 feet of PA Route 462 and the Route 30 bypass.           2.2   HIGHWAY REBAR       The Company has the right to a new rebar product that can be used in its development of highways and rail route structures. ARMT would manufacture the Rebar for use in projects like the Alabama Toll Road, and the Texas Trade Corridor, and Yuma Trade Corridor.        The Company is the only USA   compos  i  te C-Rebar   Company that is federally certified to meet all federal specs for use in any government funded projects  .   Congress gave final approval a $10  9  - billion transportation funding bill. Included in the compromise legislation is a pro  v  ision that calls for the use of total life-cycle cost analysis as part of the contract-awarding process for new federal projects. The result could be billions of dollars in new business for   t  he composites industry.          The fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites industry has long advocated for the U  .  S. Congress to require the states to employ a life-cycle cost assessment when issuing contracts for infrastructure construction.          As a practical matter  ,   such a provision will save money because new infrastructure construct  i  on would take into account both the cost of installation and long-term upkeep  , r  ather than awarding a contract solely on the basis of lowest initial cost  .   According to the new bill, the engineering analysis used by the State Departments of Transportation for awarding construction contracts for highway bridge projects shall   "  be evaluated by the State ... on engineering and economic bases  ,   taking into consideration. Acceptable designs for bridges ... and ... using an analysis of life-cycle costs and duration of project construction." This change paves the way for the use of composites and other high  -  performance materials in major infrastructure projects.           "These life-cycle cost analysis requirements should push the states toward the use of longer-life and lower-maintenance    -  cost designs, including projects that employ non-rusting and light-weight components such as Composite C- REBAR    ,   girders    ,   and deck systems," says the Senior Director of Government Affairs at the American Composites Manufacturers Association, John Schweitzer    .   "There are over 600    ,  000 highway bridges in the U    .  S    .,   making this a very large potential market for FRP composite products." For more information about the benefits of life Dee-cycle cost assessment read this    white paper    by transportation policy expert and three decade veteran of the Congressional Research Service, John W. Fische    r.            In February 2011  ,   the Company issued an offer letter to purchase a rebar plant for cash of $4,750,000 and an option to purchase management services to support the operations of the plant  .   The Company is also engaged in development of other transportation projects  ,  including the development of a toll road in the State of Alabama Company needing 400 MILLION FEET  of Composite C- Rebar. HSR Technologies  ,   Inc. will facilitate the manufacturing and distribution of Composite C- Rebar.

TEMS has considerable trade corridor and high speed rail experience including:         Trade Corridor Qualifications        This study was undertaken to identify the potential of Port Freeport Texas to become a major container terminal port and the investment case for building a new rail line to avoid the railroad congestion of the City of Houston, and serve the inland markets of Dallas/Ft. Worth and a hinterland that could stretch as far north as Chicago, as far west as Denver, and as far east as Birmingham.   The analysis evaluated the traffic potential for Gulf and East Coast ports of the opening of the Panama Canal using the traffic and revenue models that TEMS developed for the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) and which is in use today by ACP to estimate container, grain, auto, and petro chemical, traffic volumes and revenues. The analysis estimated the market share for Port Freeport. This analysis was made in the environment of larger ships using the Panama Canal and the expansion and deepening to 65 foot of Port Freeport. The Port Freeport expansion included    On Dock Rail    Facilities and the building of a new rail link 60 miles from Port Freeport to Rosenberg where the new line would connect to the UP, BNSF, and KCS railroads and would bypass the city of Houston.   The analysis estimated the size of the hinterland of Port Freeport and prepared forecasts for traffic from Port Freeport to the hinterland 2020 to 2050. The analysis estimated the costs for developing the Port and its infrastructure and then provided a financial and economic analysis using USDOT Tiger Grant Cost Benefit methodology. The analysis also evaluated the operating and capital cost benefits to the freight railroads of using the new rail connection at a cost per mile of 29 percent of the Alameda Corridor in Los Angeles.      SERVICES PROVIDED:  Container traffic market share by port and forecasts, rail and highway inland distribution from ports, operating and capital costs, financial and economic analysis.           MARITIME ADMINISTRATION/U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION: IMPACT OF HIGH OIL PRICES ON FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION     MODAL SHIFT POTENTIAL IN FIVE CORRIDORS     TEMS prepared an overview and background synopsis on the historical and potential impacts of oil price increases on the total transportation market, mode shares, and industrial distribution logistics. This included evaluating existing trends in rail, truck, and water markets, together with an assessment of the evolving market conditions and changes in modal competitiveness, particularly with respect to long distance movements using period 2008 to 2040. TEMS forecast traffic changes for water, rail and truck traffic in five corridors including the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway. The five corridors cover ninety-five percent of U.S. population. TEMS evaluated the market share impact and assessed the energy and environmental benefits of the market share changes using the GOODS    model.    SERVICES PROVIDED:   Market share analysis, energy and environmental impacts, traffic forecasts, economic analysis, and technology assessments.               37         SAN PEDRO PORTS: ALAMEDA FREIGHT CORRIDOR     TEMS provided financial and economic advice to PaineWebber and Goldman, Sachs in the preparation of a $2 billion bond issue to finance a 15mile freight corridor across the City of Los Angeles. TEMS performed macroeconomic analysis, port and freight traffic projections, and tolls and user fees, and assessed the economic benefits of the project. A key TEMS responsibility was preparing the West Coast Ports Competitive Model and assessing the revenue potential of the San Pedro (Los Angeles and Long Beach) port complex, the fourth largest port in the world.   The freight forecasts were based on traffic and trade data developed specifically for the project from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Department of Commerce, Piers Journal of Commerce, and WEFA macroeconomic trade forecasts. From these sources, TEMS developed a Base Year origin-destination matrix for freight flows on a commodity and mode basis.   TEMS prepared these forecasts using a range of macroeconomic scenarios and trade regulatory conditions. The analysis considered the impacts of NAFTA on North American trade and traffic, as well as the expansion of European, Asian and Latin American trade blocks. The forecasts were then disaggregated on a mode basis and were evaluated in terms of improvements to new transport technologies and systems and the impact of new infrastructure and tariff systems.     SERVICES PROVIDED:   Demand, revenue, financial analysis, economic, and cost/benefit assessment of freight feasibility, implementation and port master planning              AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMA   S (ACP): PANAMA CANAL ROUTE CHOICE MODEL      TEMS developed within the GOODS    Model framework, a route choice model for the Panama Canal. Using a zone system designed to reflect world trade flows between North America and the rest of the world, TEMS developed a route choice model using the GOODS    equilibrium model structure. The origin-destination data showed the country of origin and destination for container, vehicle, and grain flows. Container traffic was disaggregated to include food, industrial goods, furniture, computers, raw materials, and finished goods. The North American market was broken down into thirteen regions, and connected to the major port systems such as Pacific North West, Southern California, Gulf, Northeast Ports, etc. A supply side generalized cost model was developed linking all the major international traffic flows to North America. The analysis segmented markets on a geographic basis and over 54 individual models were calibrated to identify specific market characteristics.     The model was used to forecast a range of impacts on world trade including: oil prices, maritime costs, port congestion, and distribution costs. A full sensitivity analysis was completed showing the impact of socioeconomic growth trends, as well as the impact of specific transportation issues such as labor costs, oil prices, port charges, canal tolls, and inland distribution costs. As a result, a full range of risk factors were developed showing the likely changes in world trade and their impact on Panama Canal traffic and revenue.

Ameri Metro Organization and Operation         6.1   ARMT ORGANIZATION    ARMT and its wholly owned subsidiary Global Transportation and Infrastructure, Inc. are truly Pioneers of Global transportation and Infrastructure projects, and plan on leading the world into better tomorrow by  CHANGING THE WAY YOU MOVE .  As the US and World population is rapidly increasing and global Infrastructure is being surpassed in its ability to safely and adequately provide the effective transportation for sustainable economics. Infrastructure is becoming inadequate and dilapidated. Governing authorities    ability to keep up with preventative maintenance and replacement is lacking funding. Studies have consistently shown that the development of Infrastructure permeates economics growth. Lacks of funding due to global financial crises have sent governments into restructuring their budgets and bail outs have further reduced the possibility for governmental funding.        The ARMT management team has recognized the need for its knowhow and its ability to curb the financial burden on the governments and taxpayer alike.  ARMT has developed a solid global approach to lead the world into a better tomorrow by  CHANGING THE WAY YOU MOVE .            Due to scale and complexity of infrastructure finance much thought has been given by ARMT to overall financial requirements, and the functionality of financial structure of ARMT operation.       ARMT has created the private finance and foundation for three profits entities:   1.   Alabama Toll Facilities, Inc. (ATFI)   2.   Hi Speed Rail Facilities, Inc. (HSRF)   3.   Hi Speed Rail Facilities Provider, Inc. (HSFP)   These three entities play a vital role in financing. The non-profits statues provides a vehicle to issue bonds and help secure Infrastructure projects non-profit has the discretion to turn over the Infrastructure projects to the state or the governing body having jurisdiction after it has successfully developed and paid for the projects.  However, in order to support the functionality of financial structure and manage the development of specific projects, sixteen for profit entities have been developed under the ARMT umbrella:        1.     HSR Freight Line, Inc.      2.     HSR Passenger Services, Inc.      3.     HSR Technologies, Inc.      4.     HSR Logistics, Inc.      5.     KSJM International Airport, Inc.      6.

No money moves to any parties without trust authorization.        The Market        The Company believes that the United States suffers from an overburdened transportation infrastructure and that a fundamental overhaul of the dilapidated national transportation structure is needed according to Society of Civil Engineering reports (http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org). The Company anticipates that it will be able to assist in this    fundamental overhaul    by providing both the hands-on expertise and investment resources to establish an intermodal grid comprised of transportation and support services extending to urban and outlying areas alike.       The infrastructure experts believe that there is a compelling need to revitalize America   s transportation infrastructure. As all levels of government are facing increasing economic crisis, the Company anticipates that such revitalization will be the result of public-private partnerships and alliances to create the basis for developing such an infrastructure. Organizations, such as the Company, are accordingly poised to play a significant role in the redevelopment and improvement of the nation   s transportation infrastructure.       The 2009 David R. Goode National Transportation Policy Conference held at the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia, outlined the compelling need to revitalize America   s transportation infrastructure and recommended that    Public private partnerships need to emerge from the laboratory of pilot programs to play a much larger role as a core element of America   s transport investment strategy.    Organizations, such as the Company, are accordingly poised to play a significant role in the redevelopment and improvement of the nation   s transportation infrastructure. The same transportation conference also noted that,    Lacking a coherent vision for our transportation future and chronically short of resources, we defer new investments, fail to plan, and allow existing systems to fall into disrepair. This shortsightedness and under investment   at the planning level and on our nation   s roads, rails, airports and waterways   costs the country dearly. It compromises our productivity and ability to compete internationally; transportation users pay for the system   s inefficiencies in lost time, money and safety. Rural areas are cut off from economic opportunities and even urbanites suffer from inadequate public transportation options. Meanwhile, transportation-related pollution exacts a heavy toll on our environment and public health.          Furthermore, the conference report was equally insistent on the need for private sector funding. In    Recommendation 8: Connecting the Dots,    the co-chairs wrote:    Resolving the controversy over private equity contributions to the transport system is essential to meet the nation   s pressing transportation challenges, as is recognizing the appropriate role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in taking on those challenges.    They added,    PPPs need to emerge from the laboratory of pilot programs to play a much larger role as a core element of America   s transport investment strategy.          To resolve this crisis will require a massive infusion of capital. The National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission, in its 2009 report Paying Our Way estimates the total shortfall between what is required and what is available, at all levels of government, just for maintaining the current system range from $134 billion to $194 billion per year for the period 2008 to 2035. If the goal is to improve existing transportation systems, the shortfall is even larger: $189   $262 billion per year over the same time period.            46       The main problem is that the funds to either maintain or improve existing transportation systems are simply not available from traditional sources. Taxpayers at all levels of government are loath to support any tax increases for infrastructure projects. New transportation systems are frequently discussed at all levels of government but the public funding for implementing such plans is usually non-existent.       The Company has met recently with Appalachian Regional Commission. Their region consists of 420 counties in 13 states, serving more than 25 million people. See Exhibit 10.17. Political pressure is increasing to find alternate transportation systems as the price of gas and environmental risk of drilling and using petroleum products rises. Highway maintenance is increasingly expensive as the price of materials and labor increases.  Highway congestion is an increasing urban problem. The Company presented a project as a total package thereby providing the municipalities with the complete overview and relieving it of the time and costs involved in studying the proposal, seeking pricing information and projecting results. In addition, the Company believes that it may be able to effect economies of scale by purchasing new and renovating existing equipment and facilities on an integrated regional basis rather than in fractured individual areas or small municipalities.  The project also creates many jobs in the areas that the facilities are located in.       The Non-Profit High Speed Rail Facilities Inc., has been identified in House Resolution 948 of the 2016 Georgia Legislative Session. High speed rail will connect freight and passenger services from Georgia to Alabama and throughout Georgia. See Exhibit 10.14        The Company has met recently with Port of Freeport and Brazoria-Fort Bend Rail District,   herein incorporated by reference from the Form 8-K, dated 05/12/2016, as described in Exhibit 10.12 thru 10.44  ,       to expand the port operations along with passenger and freight rail.        "Forecasts from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts predict that the U.S. and Texas economies will rebound from the current recession (in terms of GSP and GDP), and grow at 2.6 percent and 3.37 percent, respectively, on average, per year between 2010 and 2035.  An efficient and well-maintained transportation system is vital to the state   s ability to remain economically competitive at home and abroad."       Boeing is expected to introduce 34,000 new airplanes in the next 15 years. See   herein incorporated by reference from the Form 8-K, dated 05/12/2016, as described in Exhibit 10.12 thru 10.44  TEMS, consultants to the Company, has met recently with authorities in Texas concerning a freight airport.             Philadelphia, PA           Governor Tom Wolf today announced his strategic plan for sustained management, maintenance, and development of the Port of Philadelphia   . The governor emphasized his key priorities of investing in infrastructure, creating jobs, and keeping Pennsylvania economically competitive. See   herein incorporated by reference from the Form 8-K, dated 05/12/2016, as described in Exhibit 10.12 thru 10.44  . The Company has been in discussions with elected officials concerning expansion of the port.          Michigan        Coast to Coast Passenger Rail Ridership and Cost Estimate Study, prepared by TEMS, consultants to the Company, is ready for design build upon funding being available. See   herein incorporated by reference from the Form 8-K, dated 05/12/2016, as described in Exhibit 10.12 thru 10.44  .           The New York - Washington       Corridor    is the highest ranking corridor in the US and is the only corridor that could be developed without or only limited government funds, according to a feasibility study prepared by TEMS, consultants to the Company. See   herein incorporated by reference from the Form 8-K, dated 05/12/2016, as described in Exhibit 10.12 thru 10.44  . As such, the corridor provides an operating cash flow that can pay back the 35 Billion capital cost from the fare box.           High Speed Rail Technologies Inc.    to provide technology services of intellectual property use for the Company operations.  That will include composite rebar manufacturing plant and product for the Alabama Toll Way Facility and rail car technology for DMU (Diesel Multi Unit Technology) along with composite rail road ties. See   herein incorporated by reference from the Form 8-K, dated 05/12/2016, as described in Exhibit 10.12 thru 10.44  .         TEMS- Transportation Economics Management Systems,  identified projects for the Company focus as part of the growth strategy. See herein incorporated by reference from the Form 8-K, dated 05/12/2016, as described in Exhibit 10.12 thru 10.44.       The Company is facing solid growth for next 20 years or more. According to    McKinsey Global Institute- The McKinsey Infrastructure Practice Report- January 2013; confirms that 57 to 67 trillion dollars of investment is need for infrastructure from 2013 to 2030. Due to robust infrastructure market and a tremendous back log of infrastructure projects on hand, along with anticipated projects identified by the Company   s infrastructure projects consultants; TEMS, Inc. Management believes that market conditions warrants that the company reconsider its capital structure and in September 2014 it has amended its Certificate of Incorporation increase its authorized shares. Market conditions were further supported by    The Boeing Current Market Outlook 2012-2013 report    which shows an 80 % growth over next 20 years for cargo fleet.         47        Entry of the Company into the Market        The Company anticipates that it can offer a comprehensive, innovative approach to resolving the nation   s transportation crisis. And it proposes doing so without the necessity of the government increasing taxes at any level, or in any manner. In short, the Company suggests replacing public financing with private funding.       The primary competitive barrier most companies face in attempting to impact the nation   s infrastructure crisis is that they approach the overall problem in disparate segments. For example, one provider proposes building railroad cars, while another proposes laying tracks. A third is interested in depots, while a fourth focuses on accommodations. None bring a comprehensive plan for full-funding to the mix. On the other hand, the Company takes an intermodal approach to providing seamless service with a scale of economy. For example the high-speed rail plan will utilize existing rail rights-of-way to connect several metropolitan areas and states serving expanding populations.       The Company through related parties also foresees pursuing joint ventures with other industries related to the transportation industry. For example, HSR Technologies it is currently finalizing an arrangement with a major manufacturer of certain materials used in the construction of highways and other transportation systems. The discussions contemplate a two-fold transaction by which the Company would initially buy the manufacturing plant and then subsequently purchase the remaining non-cash assets of the Company.        Competition        The Company may face significant competition from other companies that may be developing competing transportation systems.  The Company will, however, face competition in the allocation of monetary resources from governmental agencies, at the local, regional, state and federal levels. The Company believes that government agencies will strongly endorse its proposed plan for high-speed regional rail systems, but believes that, given the economic environment, there may be few or no funds available for such development.       Nevertheless, as an example, traditionally significant competition generally exists in the industry, from government agencies and entities. Due to the federal budgetary constraints, henceforth any completion would come from private or public entities. On the heels of the Department of Transportation   s recent request for high-speed rail proposals, its Federal Railroad Administration received 132 applications from 32 states totaling $8.8 billion. That was more than three times the $2.4 billion available. During the first round of awards in the fall of 2009, applicants submitted more than $55 billion in project proposals. That was nearly six times the initial $8 billion available from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Unfortunately, due to federal budgetary setbacks, as of 2016, very little of this has come to fruition.        Trading Market        While there currently is no market for the shares, a market maker has filed the initial Form 15c2-11 with FINRA.         Employees        In addition to the Chief Executive Officer, the Company has a few paid employees and approximately twenty six other persons who are working on behalf of the Company to assist in the development of its initial high-speed rail project. None of these people currently receive salaries or other compensation. Certain employee   s salaries are being accrued. The Company has also issued stock to employees for their consulting and professional services. At the time the Company launches its planned IPO, the Company will pay these employees.        Subsidiaries        The Company has one subsidiary, Global Transportation   Infrastructure Inc. (   GTI   ) incorporated in the state of Delaware. GTI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Company owns 25% of each of the companies listed in the section    Related Companies   .

We urge you to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this Quarterly Report, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 201  6   and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the    SEC   ).          Results of Operations          Comparison of the   Three   Months Ended   October 31, 2016   and 2015.        The Company has no source of continuing revenues and received no revenues for the three months ending October 31, 2016 and 2015.          For the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had total operating expenses of $1,693,287 and $2,671,257, respectively and net losses of $1,698,055 and $2,671,408, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses and net loss resulted primarily from reductions in professional fees and directors fees.        Liquidity and Capital Resources        Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities and total liabilities as of October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016 were as follows:                          49       Cash Requirements       We had $620 in cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2016.  Our cash used in operations for the three months ended October 31, 2016 was $35,816. We had a net loss for the three months ended October 31, 2016 of $1,398,055. We had an accumulated deficit of $23,548,278 at October 31, 2016. Our cash on hand is not sufficient to cover our monthly expenses and we continue to seek financing in the form of debt or stock sales to finance our operations. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts.       Sources and Uses of Cash         Operations     For the three months ended October 31, 2016, our net cash used in operating activities was $35,816, which consisted primarily of our net loss of $1,698,055, offset primarily by increases in accrued expenses of $1,679,975. For the three months ended October 31, 2015, our net cash used in operating activities was $44,887 which consisted primarily of our net loss of $2,671,408 offset by an increase in accrued expenses of $1,675,729 and an increase in accounts payable of $952,957.         Financing     For the three months ended October 31, 2016, our net cash provided by financing activities was $9,276, which consisted of net proceeds from related party loans. For the three months ended October 31, 2015 our net cash provided by financing activities was $86,207, which consisted primarily of proceeds from related party loans of $112,000 less repayments of related party loans of $26,065.        Related Party Transactions    At October 31, 2016, the Company is indebted to three directors of the Company for $1,050 (July 31, 2016 - $1,050) for expenditures incurred on behalf of the Company.  The amount is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.   As of October 31, 2016, $970,243 (July 31, 2016 - $960,907) is due to the majority shareholder, of which $508,531 is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand, $11,829 is past due with an interest rate of 3%, $57,767 is due on December 31, 2016 with interest at 3%, $95,600 is past due with an interest rate of 2%, $107,240 is due on March 1, 2017 with an interest rate of 7%, $180,000 is due on demand with an interest rate of 4%, and $9,276 is due on October 1, 2017 with an interest rate of 3%.  At October 31, 2016, accrued interest on these loans is $18,810 (July 31, 2016 - $14,068).         Going Concern        The Company has negative working capital, has incurred losses since inception, and has not yet received significant revenues from sales of products or services. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company   s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.        The ability of Ameri Metro to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company generating cash from the sale of its common stock and/or obtaining debt financing and attaining future profitable operations. Management   s plans include selling its equity securities and obtaining debt financing to fund its capital requirement and on-going operations; however, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful in these efforts.  The Company has recently had meetings with certain groups and municipalities regarding proposed transportation infrastructure projects, and it has also met with potential investors for these projects; in addition, it recently filed a stock registration statement so stock can be issued to raise funding for these projects.        Critical Accounting Policies        The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  The estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.       The Company believes that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:     50        Use of Estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.         Sharebased payments        The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation     Stock Compensation  which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.  The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.        The Company follows ASC Topic 505-50, formerly EITF 96-18,  Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services , for stock options and warrants issued to consultants and other non-employees.  In accordance with ASC Topic 505-50, these stock options and warrants issued as compensation for services provided to the Company are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair market value of the option or warrant, whichever can be more clearly determined. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.        Recent Accounting Pronouncements        For the three month period ended October 31, 2016, there were no accounting standards or interpretations issued that are expected to have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.        Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.        As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.        Item 4. Controls and Procedures.    We conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of October 31, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commission   s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of October 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses identified and described in our Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. However management is focused on putting in place effective controls.        Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting        No change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report, the three month period ended October 31, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        51        PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings.        There are currently no pending, threatened or actual legal proceedings in which the Company or any of its directors are a party.        Item 1A. Risk Factors.        As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.        Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.        None        Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.        None.        Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.        Not applicable.        Item 5. Other Information.        Not applicable.
