     Table of Contents          MAKKANOTTI GROUP CORP.     NOTES TO  CONDENSED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016     (UNAUDITED)       NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS      Makkanotti Group Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus      NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Presentation    The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in Form 10-K for the fiscal period ended March 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on June 24, 2016.       Use of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Property and Equipment    Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using principally the straight-line method. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of, income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value and proceeds realized thereon. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and replacements and betterments are capitalized. The range of estimated useful lives used to calculate depreciation for principal items of property and equipment are as follows:              Asset Category         Useful Life            Furniture and fixtures         3 years           Office equipment         3 years           Computer software         5 years              We periodically review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value. We recorded no impairment on our long-lived assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.       Revenue Recognition       Revenue generated from providing the sale of goods and services.      Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, our goods and services have been provided, all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied, and collection is reasonably assured. No guarantees or warranties are provided for the goods or services we render. Due to the nature of the goods and services provided and method of billing and collection, we do not offer a refund policy.                   6       
     Table of Contents           MAKKANOTTI GROUP CORP.     NOTES TO  CONDENSED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    (UNAUDITED)       Revenue from sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the end customer and collectability is reasonably assured.      If payments for revenues are received prior to the products being shipped or services being rendered, those revenues, and costs directly associated with such revenues, are deferred until such time as the product or services are provided.       Income Taxes       The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.        Fair Value Measurements       The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.     The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.      ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:     Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities     Level 2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable     Level 3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)     The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.        Loss Per Share        The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260,  Earnings per Share.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments outstanding.       Recently Issued Standards       In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The purpose is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is not permitted except for limited provisions. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations.     There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.                 7       
     Table of Contents           MAKKANOTTI GROUP CORP.     NOTES TO  CONDENSED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016     (UNAUDITED)        NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN       The accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company has generated minimal revenues since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $33,336 at September 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties.  No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.     The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.      NOTE 4   LOAN PAYABLE   RELATED PARTY      During the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $7,000 from a former officer and its founder resulting in $11,032 in total being owed at that time. These loans were exchanged for cash of $389, prepaid assets of $1,100, inventory of $2,484 and equipment of $6,428 resulting in a gain of $631.       NOTE 5   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY        Authorized Stock    The Company has authorized 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. Each common share entitles the holder to one vote, in person or proxy, on any matter on which action of the stockholders of the corporation is sought.       Common Share Issuances    On March 16, 2015, the company issued a total of 5,000,000 common shares to its founder for a cash contribution of $4,982 in connection with a subscription agreement in the amount of $5,000. The difference between the subscription amount and the amount contributed had been recorded as a stock subscription receivable in the amount of $18. The subscription was received on April 30, 2015.     During September 2015, the company issued a total of 1,940,000 common shares for cash contribution of $19,400 at $0.01 per share.     The Company declared a 3.6 to 1 forward stock split for shareholders of record on June 30, 2016. These common shares were issued on July 21, 2016 resulting in 24,984,000 common shares being outstanding as of September 30, 2016.      NOTE 6   CONCENTRATION      Principally all of the revenues generated during six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were from one customer  Epidorpio Confectionery  Bakery.       NOTE 7   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS       Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statement were available to be issued. Based on the evaluation no material events have occurred that require recognition in or disclosure to the financial statements other than those stated above.                 8       
     Table of Contents           ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT' DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT NOTICE       Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.     The Company approved a 3.6-for-1 forward stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, payable as a dividend as of July 21, 2016. As a result of the forward split, the Company now has 24,984,000 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock which has been retroactively accounted for.      Financial information contained in this quarterly report and in our unaudited condensed interim financial statements is stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.       GENERAL      Makkanotti Group Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus.     As a result of a private transaction on June 28, 2016, the control block of stock of this company, represented by 5,000,000 shares of common stock, has been sold by Anna Ioannou and a change of control of the Company occurred. Contemporaneously with the aforementioned private transaction, Anna Ioannou, the existing sole director and officer, resigned as the director, president, chief executive and treasurer of the Company. Upon the resignation of Anna Ioannou, Michael Hlavsa was appointed as the Company's sole director, president, secretary and treasurer. There are no transactions to which the Company is a party and in which Mr. Hlavsa has a direct or indirect material interest that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.        Our product        The main product of the Company's manufacturing process is a paper bag. Paper bags are generally used in all supermarkets, fruit kiosks, bakeries and cafes and other places and in everyday life. Grocery bags are ideal for carrying food products and are an environmentally friendly choice as they are made from recyclable materials. The Company in a development stage of business is planning to manufacture two types of paper bags, such as flat bottom paper bags and strung in the corner paper bags. Paper bags are used widely by children as tuck-shop bags or lunch bags, also in supermarkets for storing different kind of fruits and vegetables, in bakeries, caf s, and restaurants for packing food.                   9       
     Table of Contents            Equipment         We have purchased one paper food bag-forming machine  RUITAI KTPM-A  for $6,000 from a Chinese company "Chinese Investment Services Company Limited". This model is user-friendly and simple in operating. The regular preventive maintenance of the machine will be fulfilled by a specialist, who we are planning to hire in the future.      Also in December 2015, we bought one printing machine for $2,278 from the same Chinese company "Chinese Investment Services Company Limited". It lets us make exclusive paper bags with different images on them.        Marketing of paper bags        Our sole officer and director will be responsible for marketing of our products. The Company is planning to contact a marketing specialist for promotion. Currently we do not have any agreements with any marketing specialists. We intend to use marketing tools, such as web and newspaper advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We believe that one of the most powerful aspects of online marketing is the ability to target our chosen group with a high degree of accuracy and cost effective way.         Industry analysis        Makkanotti Group Corp. is planning to expand its business in the nearest municipalities, such as Lakatamia and Strovolos in Cyprus. In any city we plan to expand our operations to where there are many different supermarkets, fruit kiosks, sweets kiosks and bakeries that may be interested in cooperation with the Company. We offer high-quality and inexpensive products, which can satisfy any client requirements. Besides such kind of distribution network we plan to sign agreements with distributors of similar products. We are planning to offer a commission from sales to our potential partners. We also plan to have a special section on our website for potential partners with examples of our products and offers for wholesale clients and partners.        Storage and delivery of paper bags        The product produced by Makkanotti Group Corp. does not require any storage facilities as it will be manufactured directly for each order. The number of demonstration samples will be kept is insignificant and does not require any special premises for storage. Our machines will be located at our leased premise in Nicosia, Cyprus. Term of manufacturing will depend on customer's order.        Contracts and negotiation with customers        To the date the Company has entered into Agreement for Sale of Goods with "Epidorpio Confectionery" Bakery, who has agreed to buy our paper bags for packing its flour products and Agreement for Sale of Goods with "A G KOKKINOU LTD.". The Company is also planning to contact G.I. MONADIKON LTD www.monadikon.com, Qboo Bakehouse and The Xechoron Trading Company LTD in regard of future cooperation.                Insurance        We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.        Employees        We are in a development stage and currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director who does not receive any compensation.         Office        Our office located at Larnakos Avenue, 73, ap. 402, Nicosia, Cyprus 1046. Our phone number is   +011 357   (407) 720-5503.        Government Regulation        We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.

Our net losses for the six month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $18,304 and $1,512, respectively.       LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016       As of September 30, 2016 we did not have any assets.      As of September 30, 2016 our current liabilities were $8,352, comprised of accounts payable. Stockholder's deficit was $8,352.      CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES      We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the six month period ended September 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $11,322.      CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES       For six month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any cash flows from investing activities.      CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES       For the six month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company has $6,611 provided from financing activities consisting of proceeds of a loan from a related party of $7,000 and payments of $389.      PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING       The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Our cash reserves are not sufficient to meet our obligations for the next twelve month period. As a result, we will need to seek additional funding in the near future. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of shares of our common stock. We may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors or unrelated parties .               GOING CONCERN       The Company has generated minimal revenues since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $33,336 at September 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.       OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARANGEMENTS       As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.       None       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 using the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").     A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.                  1.    We do not have an Audit Committee   While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management's view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company's financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management's activities.                             2.    We did not maintain appropriate cash controls   As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company's bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts.                      3.    We did not implement appropriate information technology controls   As at September 30, 2016, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company's data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.          Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company's internal controls.     As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.        Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting       There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, that occurred during our first fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this quarterly report.              PART II. OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our Company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.       ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS       None       ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       None       ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITES       None       ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE       None       ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION       None              ITEM 6.
