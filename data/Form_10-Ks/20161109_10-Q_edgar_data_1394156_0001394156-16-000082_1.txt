1.           BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Nature of Business 
    
  Diversified Restaurant Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ( DRH  or the "Company") is a restaurant company operating two concepts:   Buffalo Wild Wings         Grill   Bar ( BWW ) and Bagger Dave s Burger Tavern         ( Bagger Dave s ).  As the largest franchisee of BWW and the creator, developer, and operator of Bagger Dave s, we provide a unique guest experience in a casual and inviting environment.  We were incorporated in 2006 and are headquartered in the Detroit metropolitan area.  As of   September 25, 2016  , we had   83   locations in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio. 
     
  DRH currently operates   64   DRH-owned BWW restaurants (  20   in Michigan,   17   in Florida,   seven   in Illinois,   five   in Indiana and   15   in Missouri), including the nation s largest BWW, based on square footage, in downtown Detroit, Michigan. If we remain on track with our area development agreement ( ADA ) with Buffalo Wild Wings International, Inc. ( BWLD ) we expect to operate   77   DRH-owned BWW restaurants by the end of 2021, exclusive of potential additional BWW restaurant acquisitions.  
    
  DRH originated the Bagger Dave s concept with our first restaurant opening in January 2008 in Berkley, Michigan.  Currently, there are   19   Bagger Dave s (  16   in Michigan,   one   in Indiana and   two   in Ohio).   The Board of Directors approved the tax-free spinoff of   19   of the Bagger Dave's entities and certain real estate entities which house the respective Bagger Dave's entities. DRH will continue to own and operate its   64   franchised BWW restaurants. DRH is currently developing a comprehensive separation plan for the spinoff. The Company expects to complete the spinoff in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , and for the three and   nine  -month periods ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , have been prepared by DRH pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The financial information as of   September 25, 2016   and for the three and   nine  -month periods ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   is unaudited, but, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods. 
    
  The consolidated financial information as of   December 27, 2015   is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended   December 27, 2015  , which is included in Item 8 in the Fiscal   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, and should be read in conjunction with such consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The results of operations for the three and   nine  -month periods ended   September 25, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the entire fiscal year ending   December 25, 2016  . 
    
  Segment Reporting 
    
  During the First Quarter 2016, the Company reorganized segment reporting from one reportable segment to   two   reportable segments, BWW and Bagger Dave's, due to differences that have developed in the economic characteristics between the two concepts. All prior period information was recast to reflect this change. The Company s reportable segments are organized based on restaurant concept. As reviewed by management, the results for all locations closed in fiscal 2015 are segregated for analytical purposes. Resources are allocated and performance is assessed for the concepts by the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, whom the Company has determined to be its Chief Operating Decision Makers. See Note   16   for additional information. 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill is not amortized and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identified net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment analysis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. At   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , we had goodwill of   $50.1 million  , that was assigned to our BWW operating segment. 
    
  The impairment analysis consists of a two-step process. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We estimate fair value using market information (market approach) and discounted cash flow projections (income approach). The income approach uses the reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  
  DIVERSIFIED RESTAURANT HOLDINGS, INC. 
  NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects market conditions. The projection uses management s best estimates of projected revenue, costs and cash expenditures, including an estimate of new restaurant openings and related capital expenditures. Other significant estimates also include terminal growth rates and working capital requirements. We supplement our estimate of fair value under the income approach by using a market approach which estimates fair value by applying multiples to the reporting unit s projected operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar characteristics to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment analysis must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. As of   December 27, 2015  , based on our quantitative analysis, goodwill was considered recoverable. At   September 25, 2016  , there were   no   impairment indicators warranting an analysis. 
       
  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  We review long-lived assets quarterly to determine if triggering events have occurred which would require a test to determine if the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. Assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified, which is at the individual restaurant level. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, restaurants are included in the impairment analysis after they have been open for two years. We evaluate the recoverability of a restaurant s long-lived assets, including buildings, intangibles, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, over the remaining life of the primary asset in the asset group, after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements, marketing programs, and anticipated changes in the trade area. In determining future cash flows, significant estimates are made by management with respect to future operating results for each restaurant over the remaining life of the primary asset in the asset group. If assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value based on our estimate of discounted future cash flows. The determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment.   No   impairment was recognized for the nine months ended   September 25, 2016  . During the quarter-ended June 28, 2015, the Company recorded an impairment loss of   $1.8 million   related to   three   Bagger Dave's locations.  We continue to monitor several other restaurants for potential impairment of long-lived assets while we continue to develop plans to improve operating results. As such, based on our current estimates of the future operating results of these restaurants, we believe that the assets at these restaurants are not impaired. As we periodically refine our estimated future operating results, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize impairment charges in the future that could be material. For additional details refer to the 2015 10-K filed on March 11, 2015. 
    
  We account for exit or disposal activities, including restaurant closures, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 420,   Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations  . Such costs include the cost of disposing of the assets as well as other facility-related expenses. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. Additionally, at the date we cease using a property under an operating lease, we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining lease obligations, net of estimated sublease income. Any subsequent adjustments to that liability as a result of lease termination or changes in estimates of sublease income are recorded in the period incurred.  During fiscal 2015, the Company decided to close   11   underperforming Bagger Dave's locations(  eight   in Indiana and   three   in Michigan) and opted not to renew the lease on    one   BWW location in Florida. The Company closed the restaurants during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. In connection with the 2015 closures, the Company recorded a liability of   $1.3 million   for the net present value of any remaining lease obligations, net of estimated sublease income. As of   September 25, 2016  , we have three remaining locations with a residual lease obligation that will be fulfilled by May 2017. As of   September 25, 2016  , a liability of   $246,532   remains on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and is classified as Other accrued liabilities. For additional details refer to the 2015 10-K filed on March 11, 2015. 
    
  Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
    
  Liquor licenses, which are a component of intangible assets, are deemed to have an indefinite life and, accordingly, are not amortized. Management reviews liquor license assets on an annual basis (at year-end) to determine whether carrying values have been impaired. We identify potential impairments for liquor licenses by comparing the fair value with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, the liquor licenses are not impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference.    No   impairments were recognized for the nine months ended   September 25, 2016   or fiscal year ended   December 27, 2015  .

Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
    
  The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements with Citizens Bank, N.A. ( Citizens ) to fix interest rates on a portion of the Company s portfolio of variable rate debt, which reduces exposure to interest rate fluctuations.  The Company does not use any other types of derivative financial instruments to hedge such exposures, nor does it use derivatives for speculative purposes. The Company s interest rate swap agreements qualify for hedge accounting. As such, the Company records the change in the fair value of its swap agreements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company records the fair value of its interest rate swaps on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in other long-term assets or other long-term liabilities depending on the fair value of the swaps. See Note   7   and Note   14   for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Topic 718:   Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU 2016-09").  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-09 on its Consolidated Financial Statements, although we do not expect the standard will have a significant impact.    
    
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in a lessee recognizing a lease asset and liability. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the updated guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ("ASU 2014-09"), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP.  The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein.  We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09, although based on the nature of our business we do not expect the standard will have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.     
    
  We reviewed all other significant newly-issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they either are not applicable to our operations or that no material effect is expected on our consolidated financial statements as a result of future adoption. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,   Topic 740: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU No. 2015-17 ), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. ASU No. 2015-17 provides presentation requirements to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The Company adopted this standard as of December 27, 2015, with prospective application. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 had no impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
    
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,   Interest - Imputation of Interest   (  Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.   This ASU adds paragraphs pursuant to the SEC Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force meeting about the presentation and subsequent  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  
  DIVERSIFIED RESTAURANT HOLDINGS, INC. 
  NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. ASU 2015-15 states that given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit. The Company has historically recorded and will continue to record, debt issuance costs associated with the line-of-credit as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred costs over the term of the line-of-credit, with there being no impact on previously issued financial statements.  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest-Imputation of Interest,   which updates guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct reduction of debt balances on the statement of financial position, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We retrospectively adopted this guidance in First Quarter 2016. This resulted in a reclassification of the December 27, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet of   $345,317   from Intangible assets, net to Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt, in the amounts of   $27,002   and   $318,315  , respectively. 

2.           ACQUISITION 
    
  On June 29, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of A Sure Wing, LLC, a Missouri limited liability company. The assets acquired consist primarily of   18   existing BWW restaurants,   15   in Missouri and three in Illinois. As consideration for the acquisition of the assets, the Company paid   $54.0 million   in cash at closing, subject to adjustment for cash on hand, inventory and certain prorated items. The seller reimbursed the Company for one-half of all fees imposed by BWLD under its franchise agreements for the transfer of these restaurants. The acquisition provides greater geographic diversity to the Company s restaurant portfolio. 
    
  The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed: 

The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair value of assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations of these locations are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations from the date of acquisition. 
    
  The following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma financial information as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period presented: 

The results of operations from the acquisition are included in the Company's results beginning June 29, 2015. The actual amounts of revenue and net income included in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period of June 29, 2015 to September 27, 2015 are   $10.2 million   and   $645,608  , respectively.

3.          PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
    
  Property and equipment are comprised of the following assets: 

At   September 25, 2016   and December 27, 2015,   $66,925   and   $0.9 million  , respectively, of fixed and intangible assets for the closed locations are held for sale, which are recorded in Property and equipment and Intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On June 8, 2016 we sold the Detroit Bagger Dave's building and land net of fees for approximately   $1.1 million   in proceeds, all of which we used to pay down our term loan.  We recorded a gain of $  884,717  , which is recorded in Impairment and loss (gain) on asset disposal on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We anticipate selling the remaining assets held for sale in Fourth Quarter 2016.

6.     OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITES   

7.           LONG-TERM DEBT 
    
  Long-term debt consists of the following obligations: 

On June 29, 2015, the Company entered into a   $155.0 million   senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by  
  Citizens (the  June 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility ) with a senior lien on all the Company s personal property and fixtures.  The June 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility consists of a   $120.0 million   term loan (the  June 2015 Term Loan ), a   $30.0 million   development line of credit (the  June 2015 DLOC ) and a   $5.0 million   revolving line of credit (the  June 2015 RLOC ). The Company used approximately   $65.5 million   of the June 2015 Term Loan to refinance existing outstanding debt and used approximately   $54.0 million   of the June 2015 Term Loan to refinance an acquisition occurring in second quarter 2015.   The remaining balance of the June 2015 Term Loan, approximately   $0.5 million  , was used to pay the fees, costs, and expenses associated with the closing of the June 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility.  The June 2015 Term Loan is for a period of   five years  .  Payments of principal are based upon a   12  -year straight-line amortization schedule, with monthly principal payments of   $833,333   plus accrued interest.  The entire remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest on the June 2015 Term Loan is due and payable on the maturity date of June 29, 2020.  The June 2015 DLOC is for a term of   two years   and is subject to certain limitations relative to actual development costs. Once the DLOC is fully drawn, outstanding balances convert into a term note based on the terms of the agreement, at which time monthly principal payments will be due based on a   12  -year straight-line amortization schedule, plus interest, through maturity on June 29, 2020. If the DLOC is not fully drawn by the end of the two year term, the outstanding principal balance becomes due based on the 12-year amortization period with final payment due June 29, 2020. The June 2015 RLOC, which is subject to certain usage restrictions during each annual period, is for a term of   five years  .

The interest rate for each of the loans, as selected by the borrower, is based upon either a LIBOR or base rate (generally Prime or Fed Funds) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.25% to 3.5% for LIBOR loans and from 1.25% to 2.5% for base rate loans, depending on the lease adjusted leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
    
  Fees related to the term debt are recorded as debt discount and fees related to the DLOC and RLOC are capitalized as intangible assets. Debt issuance costs represents legal, consulting and financial costs associated with debt financing. Debt discount and debt issuance cost related to term debt totaled   $553,356  , net of accumulated amortization at   September 25, 2016  . Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the DLOC and RLOC totaled   $265,661   at   September 25, 2016  . Debt discount and debt issuance cost are amortized over the life of the debt and are recorded in interest expense using the effective interest method.  
     
  For the   three-month periods ended September 25, 2016   and    September 27, 2015   and   nine-month periods ended September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , interest expense was   $1.4 million  ,   $1.8 million  ,   $4.3 million   and   $2.8 million   respectively.  
    
  The current debt agreement contains various customary financial covenants generally based on the performance of the specific borrowing entity and other related entities. The more significant covenants consist of a minimum debt service coverage ratio and a maximum lease adjusted leverage ratio, both of which we are in compliance with as of   September 25, 2016  . 
     
  At   September 25, 2016  , the Company has   six   interest rate swap agreements to fix a portion of the interest rates on its variable rate debt. The swap agreements all qualify for hedge accounting and are included in Other long-term liabilities on the Balance Sheet.  Under the swap agreements, the Company receives interest at the one-month LIBOR and pays a fixed rate. Since these swap agreements qualify for hedge accounting, the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. See Note   1   and Note   14   for additional information pertaining to interest rate swaps.   
    
  The following summarizes the fair values of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges which were outstanding:

  The Company is required by its various BWLD franchise agreements to modernize the restaurants during the term of the agreements.  The individual agreements generally require improvements between the   fifth   and   tenth   year to meet the most current design model that BWLD has approved.  The modernization costs for a restaurant can range from approximately   $50,000   to approximately   $1.3   million depending on an individual restaurant's needs. 
    
  In connection with the Bagger Dave's Burger Tavern, Inc. spin-off described in Note 1, the DRH Board of Directors approved funding of   $1.0 million   to   $3.0 million   to Bagger Dave's Burger Tavern, Inc. within twelve months after the spin-off to meet the needs for operations. This funding would only be considered if deemed necessary and in the event Bagger Dave's is unable to obtain a line of credit facility. In addition, there will be various agreements, among other things, that will govern certain aspects of the relationship with DRH following the separation, establish terms under which subsidiaries of DRH will provide services, and establish terms pursuant to which subsidiaries of DRH will obtain food product for Bagger Dave's Burger Tavern, Inc. As of September 25, 2016, DRH is listed as the guarantor on   15   of the   19   Bagger Dave's leases in the event of nonpayment of rent by Bagger Dave's. For open locations the guarantees range from two to 15 years. 
  On December 18, 2015, a collective action was filed against AMC Wings, Inc., and the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois (the "Court") by plaintiffs, David, et. al. A Sure Wing, LLC, the seller of the   18   St. Louis BWW restaurants acquired by the Company on June 29, 2015, was also named as a defendant. Plaintiffs primarily allege that former and current tipped workers at the above-mentioned companies were assigned to perform tasks outside the scope of their tipped positions, in violation of Illinois and federal law.  On July 6, 2016, the parties filed a joint Notice of Settlement, stating that the parties had reached an agreement in principle to resolve plaintiffs  class and collective action claims through June 29, 2015, for   $600,000   and intend to seek Court approval of their settlement.  On July 8, 2016, following a status conference with the parties, the Court gave leave to plaintiffs to file an amended complaint in light of the settlement discussions.  Plaintiffs did so on July 8, 2016.  On August 29, 2016, the Court granted Plaintiffs  Unopposed Motion for Preliminary Approval of the Settlement Agreement.  On September 28, 2016, the settlement administrator mailed settlement notices to   1,951   settlement class and collective members, per the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  On January 6, 2017, the Court will hold a Final Approval of the Settlement Hearing. 
  The Company has filed an indemnity claim against A Sure Wing, LLC and has received a reciprocal indemnity claim from A Sure Wing, LLC. A Sure Wing, LLC and the Company previously agreed to toll their respective indemnity claims pending resolution of the matter. A Sure Wing, LLC has agreed to fund the settlement in return for DRH releasing their indemnity claim. 
    
  Additionally, the Company is subject to ordinary and routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, which arise in the ordinary course of its business.  The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain.  While unfavorable outcomes could have adverse effects on the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition, management believes that the Company is adequately insured and does not believe an unfavorable outcome of any pending or threatened proceedings is probable or reasonably possible.  Therefore,   no   separate reserve or disclosure has been established for these types of legal proceedings.

measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We use a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs as follows: 

Level 1 
    Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 

Level 2 
    Inputs, other than level 1 inputs, either directly or indirectly observable; and 

Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs developed using internal estimates and assumptions (there is little or no market data) which reflect those that market participants would use. 

As of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , our financial instruments consisted of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate carrying value, due to their short-term nature.  
     
  The fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined based on valuation models, which utilize quoted interest rate curves to calculate the forward value and then discount the forward values to the present period. The Company measures the fair value using broker quotes, which are generally based on observable market inputs including yield curves and the value associated with counterparty credit risk. Our interest rate swaps are classified as a Level 2 measurement as these securities are not actively traded in the market, but are observable based on transactions associated with bank loans with similar terms and maturities. See Note   1   and Note   7   for additional information pertaining to interest rates swaps. 
    
  As of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , our total debt was approximately   $121.3 million   and   $126.3 million  , respectively, which approximated fair value because the applicable interest rates are adjusted frequently based on short-term market rates (Level 2). 
    
  There were   no   transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the three- and   nine  - month periods ended   September 25, 2016    and the fiscal year ended   December 27, 2015  .

16. SEGMENT REPORTING 
    
  During the First Quarter 2016, the Company reorganized segment reporting from one reportable segment to   two   reportable segments, BWW and Bagger Dave's, due to differences that have developed in the economic characteristics between the two concepts. All prior period information was recast to reflect this change. The Company s reportable segments are organized based on restaurant concept. As reviewed by management, the results for all locations closed as of September 25, 2016 are segregated for analytical purposes. Resources are allocated and performance is assessed for the concepts by the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer whom the Company has determined to be its Chief Operating Decision Makers. See Note   1   for additional information. 
    
  Revenues for all segments include only transactions with customers and include no intersegment revenues. Excluded from net income from operations for BWW and Bagger Dave's are certain legal and corporate costs not directly related to the performance of the segments, interest and other expenses related to the Company s credit agreements and derivative instruments, certain stock-based compensation expenses, certain bonus expenses and certain insurance expenses managed centrally.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated interim financial statements and related notes included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results from Operations contained in our Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended   December 27, 2015  . Information included in this discussion and analysis includes commentary on company-owned restaurants, restaurant sales, and same store sales. Management believes such sales information is an important measure of our performance, and is useful in assessing the Buffalo Wild Wings  Grill   Bar ( BWW ) concept, consumer acceptance of the Bagger Dave s Burger Tavern  ( Bagger Dave s ) and the overall health of the concepts. However, same store sales information does not represent sales in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to financial information as defined or used by other companies.

  DRH originated the Bagger Dave s concept with our first restaurant opening in January 2008 in Berkley, Michigan.  Currently, there are   19   Bagger Dave s (  16   in Michigan,   one   in Indiana and   two   in Ohio).  The Board of Directors approved the tax-free spinoff of   19   of the Bagger Dave's entities and certain real estate entities which house the respective Bagger Dave's entities. DRH will continue to own and operate its   64   franchised BWW restaurants. DRH is currently developing a comprehensive separation plan for the spinoff. The Company expects to complete the spinoff in the fourth quarter of 2016.

  The following table outlines the restaurant unit information for each fiscal year from 2012 through 2016. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  For the three-month period ended   September 25, 2016   ("  Third   Quarter   2016  ") and nine-month period ended   September 25, 2016   ("Year to Date 2016"), revenue was generated from the operations of   64   BWW restaurants and   19   Bagger Dave s restaurants. For the three-month period ended   September 27, 2015   ("  Third   Quarter   2015  ") and nine-month period ended   September 27, 2015   ("Year to Date 2015"), revenue was generated from the operations of   62   BWW restaurants and   23   Bagger Dave s restaurants. Quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing and number of new restaurant openings and related expenses, increases or decreases in same store sales, changes in commodity prices, general economic conditions, and seasonal fluctuations. As a result, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results

that may be achieved for any future period. Same store sales is defined as a restaurant's comparable sales in the first full month after the 18th month of operations for BWW and after the 24th month of operations for Bagger Dave's. Changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time. Our comparable restaurant base consisted of 71 and 64 restaurants at   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015    

Revenue for   Third   Quarter   2016   was   $46.7 million  , a decrease of   $0.4 million  , or   0.8%  , over the   $47.1 million   of revenue generated during   Third   Quarter   2015  . The decrease was attributable to the following:  $2.1 million decrease from the closure of 12 restaurant locations; $1.1 million decrease in BWW and Bagger Dave's same store sales;  $0.6 million decrease from impact of restaurants not falling in the sales comp-base because the restaurants have not been open for 18 months (BWW) or 24 months (Bagger Dave s); $3.4 million increase from seven new restaurant openings consisting of three BWW restaurants and four Bagger Dave's restaurants. 
    
  With regard to the costs and expenses discussed below, results and trends that are unique and material within our individual reporting segments have been highlighted.  Otherwise, the trends and results for the individual segments are consistent with our discussion of the composite trends and results.

Food, beverage, and packaging costs   decreased   by   $0.6 million  , or   4.4%  , to   $12.9 million   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   $13.5 million   in   Third   Quarter   2015  .  Food, beverage, and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue   decreased   to   27.7%   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   28.7%   in   Third   Quarter   2015   primarily due to commodity price relief. Average cost per pound for bone-in chicken wings, our most significant input cost for our BWW concept, decreased to $1.70 in   Third   Quarter   2016   compared to $1.78 in   Third   Quarter   2015  .  
    
  Compensation costs decreased by   $0.8 million  , or   6.2%  , to   $12.2 million   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   $13.0 million   in   Third   Quarter   2015  .  Compensation costs as a percentage of sales   decreased   to   26.2%   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   27.7%   in   Third   Quarter   2015   due to the closure of 11 Bagger Dave's locations, which had higher average labor costs as a percentage of sales.    
    
  Occupancy costs   decreased   by   $0.1 million  , or   2.6%  , to   $3.4 million   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   $3.5 million   in   Third   Quarter   2015  .  This decrease is primarily due to the Bagger Dave's closures, partially offset by the increased number of restaurants operating in   2016  . Occupancy as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat at   7.4%   in   Third   Quarter   2016   compared to   7.5%     Third   Quarter   2015  . 
    
  Other operating costs   decreased   by   $0.3 million  , or   2.6%  , to   $10.2 million   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   $10.5 million   in   Third   Quarter   2015  .  Other operating costs as a percentage of sales   decreased   to   21.9%   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   22.3%   in   Third   Quarter   2015  , primarily due to the closures, which had higher operating cost as a percentage of sales. 
    
  General and administrative expenses   decreased   by   $0.7 million  , or   18.4%  , to   $3.3 million   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   $4.0 million   in   Third   Quarter   2015  .  This decrease was primarily due to the transition of our accounting duties from a third-party to in-house, in addition to reduction in discretionary spending. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales   decreased   to   7.0%   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   8.6%   in   Third   Quarter   2015  . 
    
  Pre-opening costs   decreased   by   $0.6 million  , or   85.3%  , to   $96,316   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   $0.7 million   in   Third   Quarter   2015  . We had no new restaurant openings in the Third Quarter   2016   and opened two BWW restaurants in the Third Quarter   2016   . Pre-opening costs as a percentage of sales   decreased   to   0.2%   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   1.4%   in   Third   Quarter   2015  . 
    
  Depreciation and amortization   increased   by   $0.7 million  , or   16.2%  , to   $5.2 million   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   $4.5 million   in   Third   Quarter   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to the impact of fixed assets additions as well as an adjustment in the estimated useful life of certain assets.  Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales   increased   to   11.1%   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from   9.5%   in   Third   Quarter   2015   primarily due to the impact of the 18 acquired locations, which had higher average depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales.  
    
  Impairment and loss on asset disposal   decreased   by   $0.4 million  , or   70.5%  , to a loss of   $0.2 million   in   Third   Quarter   2016   from a loss of   $0.5 million   in   Third   Quarter   2015   pertaining to a loss recognized from the sale leaseback transaction which occurred in   Third   Quarter   2015  . Impairment and loss on asset disposal as a percentage of sales was   0.3%   in   Third   Quarter   2016   versus   1.1%   in   Third   Quarter   2015  .

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended   September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015    

Revenue for Year to Date   2016   was   $141.5 million  , an increase of   $18.1 million  , or   14.7%  , over the   $123.4 million   of revenue generated during Year to Date   2015  . The increase was attributable to the following:  $20.9 million increase from the acquisition of 18 BWW locations; $10.6 million increase from nine new restaurant openings consisting of five BWW restaurants and four Bagger Dave's restaurants;  $8.3 million decrease from the closure of 12 restaurants; $4.1 million decrease in BWW and Bagger Dave's same store sales; $1.0 million decrease from impact of restaurants not falling into the sales comp-base because the restaurants have not been open for 18 months (BWW) or 24 months (Bagger Dave s). 
    
  With regard to the costs and expenses discussed below, results and trends that are unique and material within our individual reporting segments have been highlighted.  Otherwise, the trends and results for the individual segments are consistent with our discussion of the composite trends and results.   
    
  Food, beverage, and packaging costs   increased   by   $4.1 million  , or   11.7%  , to   $39.7 million   in Year to Date    2016   from   $35.5 million   in Year to Date   2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increased number of restaurants operating in   2016  . Food, beverage, and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue   decreased   to   28.0%   in Year to Date   2016   from   28.8%   in Year to Date    2015   primarily

due to menu price increases. Average cost per pound for bone-in chicken wings, our most significant input cost for our BWW concept, increased to $1.85 in Year to Date   2016   compared to $1.81 in Year to Date   2015  .  For Bagger Dave's, we experienced commodity cost relief for beef, which was offset by an increase in potato costs and a price decrease resulting from our plattering initiative in the latter half of 2015. 
    
  Compensation costs increased by   $4.2 million  , or   12.7%  , to   $37.1 million   in Year to Date   2016   from   $32.9 million   in Year to Date   2015  .  The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of 18 BWW occurring in Second Quarter 2015.  Compensation costs as a percentage of sales   decreased   to   26.2%   in Year to Date   2016   from   26.7%   in Year to Date   2015   due to the closure of 11 Bagger Dave's locations, which had a higher average labor costs as a percentage of sales.   
    
  Occupancy costs   increased   by   $1.3 million  , or   15.9%  , to   $9.7 million   in Year to Date   2016   from   $8.3 million   in Year to Date   2015  .  The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of 18 BWW occurring in Second Quarter 2015. Occupancy as a percentage of sales remained flat at    6.8%    for Year to Date   2016   and Year to Date   2015  .   
    
  Other operating costs   increased   by   $3.7 million  , or   14.0%  , to   $29.9 million   in Year to Date   2016   from   $26.3 million   in Year to Date   2015  .  The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of 18 BWW occurring in Second Quarter 2015. Other operating costs as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat at   21.2%   for Year to Date   2016   and   21.3%   in Year to Date   2015  . 
    
  General and administrative expenses   decreased   by   $3.4 million  , or   28.2%  , to   $8.8 million   in Year to Date   2016   from   $12.2 million   in Year to Date   2015  .  This decrease was primarily due to settlement costs and expenses related to a wage-claim occurring in 2015, transitioning our accounting duties in house and a reduction in discretionary spending. This was partially offset by additional salaries and marketing expense directly related to the acquisition of 18 BWW locations. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales   decreased   to   6.2%   in Year to Date   2016   from   9.9%   in Year to Date   2015  . 
    
  Pre-opening costs   decreased   by   $1.3 million  , or   56.2%  , to   $1.0 million   in Year to Date   2016   from   $2.3 million   in Year to Date   2015  . There were five openings in Fourth Quarter 2014, which contributed to carry-over costs in First Quarter 2015.  Pre-opening costs as a percentage of sales   decreased   to   0.7%   in Year to Date   2016   from   1.9%   in Year to Date   2015  . 
    
  Depreciation and amortization   increased   by   $3.0 million  , or   27.8%  , to   $13.9 million   in Year to Date   2016   from   $10.9 million   in Year to Date   2015  .  The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of 18 BWW locations occurring in Second Quarter 2015.  Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales   increased   to   9.8%   in Year to Date   2016   from   8.8%   in Year to Date   2015   primarily due to the impact of the 18 acquired BWW locations which had higher average depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales. 
    
  Impairment and loss (gain) on asset disposal   decreased   by   $3.4 million  , or   112.9%  , to a gain of    $0.4 million   in Year to Date   2016   from a loss of   $3.0 million   in Year to Date   2015   due to the sale of the Detroit Bagger Dave's building in Second Quarter 2016 and the asset impairment associated with the closure of three Bagger Dave's location in Second Quarter 2015. Impairment and loss (gain) on asset disposal as a percentage of sales was a gain of   0.3%   in Year to Date   2016   versus   2.4%   in Year to Date   2015  . 
    
  INTEREST AND TAXES 
    
  Interest expense was   $1.4 million   and   $1.8 million   during   Third   Quarter   2016   and   Third   Quarter   2015  , respectively. The decrease was primarily due to debt curtailment during Third Quarter 2016. Interest expense was   $4.3 million   and   $2.8 million   during Year to Date   2016   and Year to Date   2015  , respectively. The increase was primarily due to the increased debt in Year to Date 2015 pertaining to the acquisition of 18 BWW locations occurring in June 2015 in addition to building of new restaurants in fiscal 2015.  
    
  For   Third   Quarter   2016  , DRH had an income tax   benefit   of   $0.8 million   compared to   Third   Quarter   2015   income tax   benefit   of   $1.4 million  . For Year to Date   2016   and Year to Date   2015  , DRH had an income tax   benefit   of   $1.2 million   compared to   Third   Quarter   2015   income tax   benefit   of   $3.5 million  .  The decrease in the income tax benefit is primarily related to the decrease in  loss before income taxes.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES; EXPANSION PLANS 
    
  On June 29, 2015, the Company, entered into a $155.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facility with a syndicate of lenders led by Citizens Bank, N.A. (the  June 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility ). The June 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility consists of a $120.0 million Term Loan (the "June 2015 Term Loan"), a $30.0 million development line of credit (the "June 2015 DLOC") and a $5.0 million revolving line of credit (the "June 2015 RLOC"). The Company immediately used approximately $65.5 million of the June 2015 Term Loan to refinance existing outstanding debt and $54.0 million of the June 2015 Term Loan to finance an acquisition occurring in the second quarter 2015. The remaining balance of the June 2015 Term Loan, approximately $0.5 million, was used to pay the fees, costs and expenses arising in connection with the closing of the loans constituting the June 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility. The June 2015 Term Loan is for a term of five years. Payments of principal shall be based upon a 12-year straight-line amortization schedule, with monthly principal payments of $833,333 plus accrued interest. The entire remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Term Loan is due and payable on the Term Loan maturity date of June 29, 2020. The June 2015 DLOC is for a term of two years and is subject to certain limitations relative to actual development costs. Once the DLOC is fully drawn, outstanding balances convert into a term note based on the terms of the agreement, at which time monthly principal payments will be due based on a 12-year straight-line amortization schedule, plus interest, through maturity on June 29, 2020. If the DLOC is not fully drawn by the end of the two year term the outstanding principal balance becomes due based on the 12-year amortization period with final payment due June 29, 2020. The June 2015 RLOC, which is subject to certain usage restrictions during each annual period, is for a term of five years.  
    
  The interest rate, as selected by the borrower, for the Term Loan, the DLOC and the RLOC is either LIBOR plus an applicable margin which ranges from 2.25% to 3.5% or base rate (generally either the Prime rate or the Federal Funds rate) plus an applicable margin which ranges from 1.25% to 2.5%. 
    
  We believe that along with our current cash balance, the cash flow from operations and availability of credit will be sufficient to meet our operational, development and debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. 
     
  Our capital requirements are primarily dependent upon the pace of our new restaurant growth plan. The new restaurant growth plan is primarily dependent upon economic conditions, the real estate market and resources to both develop and operate new restaurants.  In addition to new restaurants, our capital expenditure outlays are also dependent on the cost and potential obligation to invest in maintenance, facility upgrades, capacity enhancements, information technology and other general corporate capital expenditures. 
    
  The amount of capital required to open a new restaurant is largely dependent on whether we build-out an existing leased space or build from the ground up.  Our preference is to find leased space for new restaurant locations, but depending on the availability of real estate in specific markets, we will take advantage of alternative strategies, which may include land purchases, land leases, and ground-up construction of a building to house our restaurant operation.  We expect that a build-out of a new DRH-owned BWW restaurant will require an estimated cash investment of $1.7 million to $2.1 million (excluding potential tenant incentives). We expect to spend up to $0.3 million per restaurant for pre-opening expenses.  Depending on individual lease negotiations, we may receive cash tenant incentives, which have historically been up to $0.4 million.  The projected cash investment per restaurant is based on recent opening costs and future projections and may fluctuate based on construction costs specific to new restaurant locations. 
    
  We target a cash on cash payback on our initial total capital investment of less than four years. The expected payback is subject to how quickly we reach our target sales volume and the cost of construction. 
    
  Cash flow from operations for Year to Date   2016   was   $7.9 million   compared with   $5.8 million   for Year to Date   2015  . Net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for non-cash expenses. 
    
  Through September 25, 2016, our capital expenditures were $13.9 million. Approximately 50.0% of the capital was used for new restaurant openings and the remaining 50.0% for restaurant remodels, upgrades and other general corporate purposes.  We plan to use a portion of cash from operations to accelerate pay-down of our debt.  
    
  Although investments in new restaurants are an integral part of our strategic and capital expenditures plan, we also believe that reinvesting in existing restaurants is an important factor and necessary to maintain the overall positive dining experience for our guests. Depending on the age of the existing restaurants, upgrades have ranged from approximately $50,000 (for minor interior refreshes) to approximately $1.3 million (for a full extensive remodel of the restaurant). We target remodels of $0.6 million to $0.7 million to upgrade a typical BWW restaurant to the new Stadia design. The Company's strategy is to fully remodel existing BWW restaurants to the new Stadia design at time of scheduled refresh or remodel typically within seven years or less of opening.

     Table of Contents  

Mandatory Upgrades 
    
  As of September 25, 2016, six of the seven mandatory remodels have been completed and we expect the remaining will be completed by the end of fiscal 2016.  These were primarily funded through cash from operations, supplemented by drawing off our development line of credit. 
    
  Discretionary Upgrades and Relocations 
    
  In fiscal year   2016  , the Company invested additional capital to provide minor upgrades to a number of its existing locations, all of which we expect to fund with cash from operations. These improvements primarily consisted of refreshing interior building finishes audio/visual equipment upgrades, and patio upgrades. In fiscal year   2016  , we did not have any relocations. The decision to relocate is typically driven by timing of our current lease agreements and the availability of real estate that we deem to be a better long-term investment. Relocations are funded by a combination of cash from operations and borrowing from our credit facility. 
    
  Inflation 
    
  Our profitability is dependent, among other things, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and other raw materials, labor, energy, and other supplies and services. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant guests.  The impact of inflation on food, labor, energy, and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant operations. 
    
  All of our restaurant staff members are paid hourly rates based on the federal minimum wage.  Certain operating costs, such as taxes, insurance, and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or at higher rates and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control. 
    
  While we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements, and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility.  In addition, macroeconomic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent.  There can be no assurance that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures. 
    
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  The Company s ADA allows DRH to open   42   BWW restaurants within its designated development territory by April 1, 2021.   As of   September 25, 2016   we have opened   29   of the   42   restaurants outlined within the ADA.  If we develop the remaining   13   restaurants, the Company would operate   77   BWW restaurants by 2021, exclusive of potential additional BWW restaurant acquisitions.  If we opt to not develop a restaurant location per the ADA, BWLD has the right to penalize the Company $50,000 per location. 
    
  In connection with the Bagger Dave's Burger Tavern, Inc. spin-off described in Note 1, the DRH Board of Directors approved funding of $1.0 million to $3.0 million to Bagger Dave's Bagger Tavern, Inc. within twelve months after the spin-off to meet the needs for operations. This funding would only be considered if deemed necessary and in the event Bagger Dave's is unable to obtain a line of credit facility. In addition, there will be various agreements, among other things, that will govern certain aspects of the relationship with DRH following the separation, establish terms under which subsidiaries of DRH will provide services, and establish terms pursuant to which subsidiaries of DRH will obtain food product for Bagger Dave's Burger Tavern, Inc. As of September 25, 2016, DRH is listed as the guarantor on 15 of the 19 Bagger Dave's leases in the event of nonpayment of rent by Bagger Dave's. For open locations the guarantees range from two to 15 years.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
    
  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies have not changed materially from those previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 27, 2015  .

  Not applicable for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
    
  We are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information related to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
    
  Conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 
    
  As of   September 25, 2016  , an evaluation was performed under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 25, 2016  .

  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 25, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  Our process for evaluating controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses constant improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls and procedures and the remediation of any deficiencies that may be identified during this process.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings    
    
  The following information is incorporated by reference: the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" in Note   11   "Commitments and Contingencies" of the "Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements" of Part I, Item 1 to this Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  In addition, we are occasionally a defendant in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business, including claims arising from personal injuries, contract claims, dram shop claims, employment-related claims, and claims from guests or team members alleging injury, illness, or other food quality, health, or operational concerns. To date, none of these types of litigation, most of which are entirely or predominantly covered by insurance, has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We have insured and continue to insure against most of these types of claims. A judgment on any claim not covered by or in excess of our insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings and are not aware of any claims that could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
