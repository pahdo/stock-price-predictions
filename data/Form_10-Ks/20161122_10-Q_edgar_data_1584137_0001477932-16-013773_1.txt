     Table of Contents          ADVANCED ENVIRONMENTAL PETROLEUM PRODUCERS INC.     Notes to Condensed Financial Statements     For the period ending September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)       NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS       ORGANIZATION      Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers Inc., f/k/a Electric Vehicle Research Corporation (hereinafter  AEPP ) is a company incorporated in the State of Florida in June 2013. We were formed as a consultant to the electric vehicle research and technologies industry. The electric vehicle research and technologies industry is subject to constant change due to market trends, thereby making it extremely competitive. The electric vehicle research and technologies industry is complex, because several segments are regulated by both federal and state governments. AEPP s approach assists general business operations with the growth and development, international expansion and marketing aspects of their business, allowing our potential customers to focus on the business aspects of operations. By using the services provided by AEPP, our clients are free to focus on compliance with regulations within their industry, and to complete their primary business goals.      NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN      The Company s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.     In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan to obtain such resources for the Company include, obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.     There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern      NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANICAL STATEMENTS        The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles, for complete financial statements please refer to our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on April 14, 2016.      In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year.                  6       
     Table of Contents          ADVANCED ENVIRONMENTAL PETROLEUM PRODUCERS INC.    Notes to Condensed Financial Statements    For the period ending September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)       USE OF ESTIMATES        The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS        The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $0 at September 30, 2016 and $0 at December 31, 2015.      CASH FLOWS REPORTING        The Company follows ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method ( Indirect method ) as defined by ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period.      FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS        The Company s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.     ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:                    Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities                        Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.                        Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.                                Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.                        7

Notes to Condensed Financial Statements    For the period ending September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)       INTANGIBLE ASSETS        The Company is in the process of applying for patent protection for its products and technologies. The Company has applied the provision of ASC topic 350   Intangible   goodwill and other, in accounting for its intangible assets. The Company has abandoned the provisional patent application process. Therefore, Intangible assets have been fully expensed. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 Intangible assets totaled $0 and $3,502, respectively.       REVENUE RECOGNITION        The Company follows ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition . The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.     The Company derives revenue from consulting arrangements with clients. Revenue is generated by hourly fee structure or fixed contract costs, based on expected time to complete, additionally, costs incurred may be billed, as defined by the contractual arrangements.       RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT        The Company expenses research and development costs when incurred. Research and development costs include engineering and testing of product and outputs. Indirect costs related to research and developments are allocated based on percentage usage to the research and development. We spent $0 and $0 in research and development costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and $0 and $2,969 in research and development costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND VALUATION ALLOWANCE        The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740,  Income Taxes . Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.      NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE        Net income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share.  The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earning or loss per share. Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and diluted potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised.     Basic net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no dilutive potential common shares.                    8       
     Table of Contents          ADVANCED ENVIRONMENTAL PETROLEUM PRODUCERS INC.    Notes to Condensed Financial Statements    For the period ending September 30, 2016    (Unaudited)       RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        Except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the  FASB Accounting Standards Codification   ( ASC ) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company. Management has reviewed the aforementioned rules and releases and believes any effect will not have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.     We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU 2014-10 ) and have applied the standard as of the dates during the periods reported.     We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU 2014-09 ). The Company does not believe that the new or modified principal will not have a material effect on these financial statements.     We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.      NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES      At September 30, 2016, the Company had a net operating loss carry forward for Federal income tax purposes of $616,707 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2033 No tax benefit has been reported with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards in the accompanying financial statements because the Company believes that the realization of the Company s net deferred tax assets of approximately $232,000, calculated at an effective tax rate of 34%, federal and 3.6% state, was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are fully offset by the valuation allowance of $232,000.     Deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding its realizability.      The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the period from inception ended December 31, 2013 through the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. The Company had incurred no penalties and interest for the period from inception ended December 31, 2013 through the year ended December 31, 2015. The open tax years are 2013, 2014 and 2015.                 9

Where in any forward looking statements, the Company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.     The following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, and include but are not limited to: general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in tax laws; and the cost and effects of legal proceedings.     You should not rely on forward looking statements in this annual report. This annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as  anticipates,   believes,   plans,   expects,   future,   intends,  and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.       Our Business Overview       Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers Inc., f/k/a, Electric Vehicle Research Corporation, Inc. ( AEPP ), a Florida corporation, (the "Company") provides consulting services primarily to independent business owners and other market participants located in California, the Southeast and Midwest of the United States of America (the  U.S. ). Historically, we conducted initial marketing and sales activities to take advantage of opportunities related to time, location and quality of business operations. We have conducted our operations primarily in industry/incentive friendly regions of The United States of America.     Other consultancy companies have been concentrating on either infrastructure or specific areas of business such as battery technology and sourcing. Although this is important one has to appreciate that the overall business of electric vehicles and their implementation is considerably more complex than just specific areas where many of these companies aim to cover. The whole business has to be looked at from the ground up, from actual vehicle design, development, which then is mated to a successful power train package along with effective on-board battery and charging technologies. These overall packages will be a much more coherent way of conducting business as the packaging of complete systems mated to a successful vehicle design is key to its eventual uptake in the future along with infrastructural changes needed to both be safe and charge quickly and cost effectively.       Plan of Operation       Our plan of operation for the next twelve months will be to expand our client base. We market our consulting services to small and medium size businesses. As we continue to grow we will need to raise additional funds. We do anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital.      We do not have need for the purchase of any property or equipment at this time. AEPP will not have any significant changes in the current number of employees.            The electric vehicle industry is a vast (and growing) global market. The key factors supporting this growth and opportunity include:                   New ideas of advancement can be patented and potentially sold for profit                        New ideas would be patented creating corporate intellectual property (I.P)                        Fastest growing sector of the (electric) Automotive Industry                        Global out-reach and demand for green technologies                        Fast growing International Commercial Vehicle Sector                        The potential for both long and short-term gains                        Massive International trade                        International grants and funding also available               The founders of Advanced Environmental Petroleum Producers Inc., f/k/a, Electric Vehicle Research Corporation have extensive experience in both the technical development and production processes aspects associated with this industry, and intend on providing these services, on a contract basis, to manufacturers of electric vehicles and related technologies.     Our directors have agreed to continue to fund our operations as needed over the next 12 months until cash flows are sufficient to sustain operations. Pursuant to the agreement it is binding on our CEO and he has agreed to only the return of his capital with no interest or other consideration. Thus far there has not been any need for funds provided by our CEO. In addition, our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offerings of our company s securities after the completion of this offering. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. See  Note 2   Going Concern  in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a  going concern.       Consulting Relationship      New Opportunity Business Solutions, Inc., (NOBS) is a non-related entity that provides consulting services to our Company. AEPP is a client of New Opportunity Business Solutions, Inc. The original amount of the note payable was $199,800. The note states a 10% interest rate. The note is as support for the consulting fee which was owed by AEPP but not paid as required. The principal balance at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are $88,800 and $126,300, respectively. Accrued interest at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $58,604 and $50,324, respectively.     New Opportunity Business Solutions, Inc. the Consultant, shall serve generally, on a non-exclusive basis, as a corporate consultant. New Opportunity Business Solutions, Inc. assisted with the filing of an S-1 Registration statement with the Securities Exchange Commission and any required amendments thereafter, prepared and assisted with the filing of a 15c211 with the Financial Investment Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and any required amendments thereafter, and those other filings that shall, from time to time, be required, to successfully obtain a quotation of the Company's common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board and obtain trading thereupon. NOBS will also assist AEPP in preparation of annual 10K and quarterly 10Q statements for review by a PCAOB accountant and the Company's SEC counsel, and assisting in timely EDGAR filing of 10K and 10Q's with the SEC.             Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company      We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:                         A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD                              Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;                             Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company s executive compensation arrangements; and                             No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.         We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-Q, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).     In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.      We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.     We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act.      Critical Accounting Policies       We prepare our condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the condensed financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our condensed financial statements.      While we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.     For a full description of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.             Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.         Revenues      The Company did not have any revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      Operating Expenses       Total Expenses.  Total expenses for the three months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $13,668 and $19,913, respectively. Total expenses consisted of professional fees of $13,883 and $14,807, respectively and foreign exchange (gain) loss of ($2,301) and $0, respectively. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2,086 and $5,106, respectively. The decrease in total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to operations.        Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.         Revenues      The Company did not have any revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      Operating Expenses       Total Expenses.  Total expenses for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $55,986 and $71,065, respectively. Total expenses consisted of professional fees of $39,897 and $44,341, respectively; selling, general and administrative of $10,081 and $8,604, respectively; research and development of $0 and $2,969, respectively and foreign exchange (gain) loss of ($2,301) and $0, respectively. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $8,309 and $15,151, respectively. The decrease in total expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to reduction in research and development and professional fees.       Financial Condition       Total Assets.  Total assets were $0 and $3,502 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Total assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of intangible assets of $0 and $3,502, respectively. The decrease in total assets was due to the Company abandoning the provisional patent application and fully expensing the intangible asset.      Total Liabilities.  Total liabilities were $285,057 and $304,323 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Total liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of accounts payable of $155,572 and $127,699, respectively; notes payable of $70,881 and $126,300, respectively and accrued interest of $58,604 and $50,324, respectively. Total liabilities were due to the promissory note related to consulting contracts and payables associated with the filing exchange reports.       Liquidity and Capital Resources      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.      The Company sustained a loss for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $55,986 and $71,065, respectively. The Company has an accumulated loss of $616,707 as of September 30, 2016. Because of the absence of positive cash flows from operations, the Company will require additional funding for continuing the development and marketing of services. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.           We are presently unable to meet our obligations as they come due. At September 30, 2016 we had working capital deficit of $285,057. Our working capital deficit is due to the results of operations.      Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 was ($19,834) and ($11,952), respectively. Net cash used in operating activities included our net loss, prepaid expense, accounts payable and accrued interest.      Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,502 and ($3,502), respectively. Net cash used in investing activities included the development of intangible assets.      Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $16,332 and $0, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities included reduction of notes payable and conversion of notes payable into common stock.      We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to fund our growth from operations, pay current obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources and/or debt financing. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company s securities after the completion of this offering. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. See  Note 2   Going Concern  in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a  going concern.      We are not aware of any trends or known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity.      Capital Resources.      We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2016.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       We have made no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       We are a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.             Item 4. Controls and Procedures .        (a) Management s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.       The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.     With respect to the period ending September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.     Based upon our evaluation regarding the period ending September 30, 2016, the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. Material weaknesses noted are lack of an audit committee, lack of a majority of outside directors on the board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and management is dominated by two individuals, without adequate compensating controls. Through the use of external consultants and the review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct.     The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.       (b) Changes in Internal Controls.       There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.     For a full discussion of controls and procedures refer to Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10K.             Part II. Other Information         Item 1. Legal Proceedings.       None.       Item 1A. Risk Factors       We are a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.       During the period ending September 30, 2016, the Company engaged in the sale of its unregistered securities as described below. The shares of our common stock were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. These shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance of shares by us did not involve a public offering. The offering was not a  public offering  as defined in Section 4(a)(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, size of the offering, manner of the offering and number of shares offered. We did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors. In addition, these shareholders had necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(a)(2) since they agreed to receive shares certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a  public offering.  All shareholders are  sophisticated investors  and are family members, friends or business acquaintances of our officers and directors. Based on an analysis of the above factors, we believe we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for this transaction.     On January 6, 2016, the Company issued 30,000 shares of common stock to non-related parties in exchange for the extinguishment of $4,000 of accounts payable.      On February 11, 2016, the Company issued 4,920,000 shares of common stock to non-related parties. The shares were issued and are being held in escrow in addition to the shares issued as a part of the Share Purchase Agreement dated October 24, 2015. On July 15, 2016 the Company canceled the 4,920,000 shares issued on February 11, 2016 per a verbal agreement.     On July 6, 2016, the Company issued 1,600,000 shares of common stock to a non-related party in exchange for the extinguishment of $8,000 of notes payable. The shares were issued at $0.005 per share.     On August 19, 2016, the Company issued 4,450,000 shares of common stock to non-related parties in exchange for the extinguishment of $22,250 of notes payable. The shares were issued at $0.005 per share.           Additional shares of our common stock were issued at fair market value of the share price as set forth in the table below.             Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities       None.       Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures       Not applicable.       Item 5. Other Information.       None.             Item 6.
