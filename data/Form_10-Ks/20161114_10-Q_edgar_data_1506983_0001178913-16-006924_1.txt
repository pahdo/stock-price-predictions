NOTE 1 
               
 GENERAL 

A. 
 
 Integrity Applications, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on May 18, 2010 under the laws of the State of Delaware.  On July 15, 2010, Integrity Acquisition Corp. Ltd. (hereinafter: "Integrity Acquisition"), a wholly owned Israeli subsidiary of the Company, which was established on May 23, 2010, completed a merger with A.D. Integrity Applications Ltd. (hereinafter: "Integrity Israel"), an Israeli corporation that was previously held by the stockholders of the Company.  Pursuant to the merger, all equity holders of Integrity Israel received the same proportional ownership in the Company as they had in Integrity Israel prior to the merger. Following the merger, Integrity Israel remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  As the merger transaction constituted a structural reorganization, the merger has been accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.  Integrity Israel was incorporated in 2001 and commenced its operations in 2002.  Integrity Israel, a medical device company, focuses on the design, development and commercialization of non-invasive glucose monitoring devices for use by people with diabetes.

B. 
 
 Going concern uncertainty

Since its incorporation, the Company did not conduct any material operations other than those carried out by Integrity Israel.  The development and commercialization of Integrity Israel's product is expected to require substantial expenditures.  Integrity Israel and the Company (collectively, the "Group") have not yet generated any material revenues from operations, and therefore they are dependent upon external sources for financing their operations. As of September 30, 2016, the Group has incurred an accumulated deficit of $34,189,683, stockholders  deficit of $9,937,906   and negative operating cash flows.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Group s ability to continue as a going concern.  The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  During 2012, the Company raised a total amount of approximately $1.0 million (net of related expenses) from the issuance of Common Stock. During 2013, the Company raised funds in an approximate amount of $5.3 million (net of related cash expenses) from the issuance of units (the  Series A Units ) consisting of shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series A Preferred Stock ) and detachable warrants to purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock (the  Series A Warrants  or  Warrants with down round protection ).  During the period between August and December 2014, the Company raised funds in an aggregate amount of approximately $7.3 million (net of related cash expenses) from the issuance of units (the  Series B Units ), each consisting of (a) one share of the Company s newly designated Series B 5.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Series B Preferred Stock ), convertible into Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $5.80 per share, (b) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $5.80 per share, up to such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series B Preferred Stock (each a  Series B-1 Warrant ) and (c) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $10.00 per share, up to such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series B Preferred Stock (each a  Series B-2 Warrant  and, together with the Series B-1 Warrants, collectively, the  Series B Warrants ).  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised funds in an aggregate amount of approximately $4.52 million (net of related cash expenses) through the issuance of 5,323 units (the  Series C Units ), each consisting of (a) one share of the Company s newly designated Series C 5.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Series C Preferred Stock ), convertible into Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $4.50 per share, (b) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $4.50 per share, up to such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series C Preferred Stock (each a  Series C-1 Warrant ) and (c) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $7.75 per share, up to such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series C Preferred Stock (each a  Series C-2 Warrant  and, together with the Series C-1 Warrants, collectively, the  Series C Warrants ), as described in further detail in Note 3.

 GENERAL (cont.) 

B. 
 
 Going concern uncertainty (cont.)

Until such time as the Group generates sufficient revenue to fund its operations (if ever), the Group plans to finance its operations through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities and/or debt securities and, to the extent available, short term and long term loans. There can be no assurance that the Group will succeed in obtaining the necessary financing to continue its operations as a going concern.

C. 
 
 Risk factors

As described in Note 1A and Note 1B above, the Group has a limited operating history and faces a number of risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties regarding continuation of the development process, demand and market acceptance of the Group's products, the effects of technological changes, competition and the development of products by competitors.  Additionally, other risk factors also exist, such as the ability to manage growth and the effect of planned expansion of operations on the Group's future results and the availability of necessary financing. In addition, the Group expects to continue incurring significant operating costs and losses in connection with the development of its products and marketing efforts. The Group has not yet generated material revenues from its operations to fund its activities and therefore is dependent on the receipt of additional funding from its stockholders and/ or new investors in order to continue its operations.

D. 
 
 Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As applicable to these consolidated financial statements, the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to (i) the fair value estimate of the Warrants with down-round protection, (ii) the allocation of the proceeds and the related issuance costs of the Series C Units, and (iii) the going concern assumptions.

 Basis of presentation

Accounting Principles

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) related to interim financial statements. As permitted under those rules, certain information and footnote disclosures normally required or included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The financial information contained herein is unaudited; however, management believes all adjustments have been made that are considered necessary to present fairly the results of the Company s financial position and operating results for the interim periods. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any other interim period or for any future period.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

 Warrants with down-round protection

The Company has determined its derivative warrant liability with respect to the Series A Warrants and warrants issued to Andrew Garrett, Inc., ( AGI ) as part of the Series A Unit offering, the Series B Unit offering and the Series C Unit offering to be a Level 3 fair value measurement and has used the Binomial pricing model to calculate its fair value. Because the warrants contain a down round protection feature, the probability that the exercise price of the warrants would decrease as the stock price decreased was incorporated into the valuation calculations.  The key inputs used in the fair value calculations were as follows:

The changes in the fair value of the Level 3 liability are as follows (in US dollars):

The key inputs used in the fair value calculations were as follows:

(*) 
 
 Due to the low trading volume of the Company s Common Stock, the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the share price of other public companies that operate in the same industry sector as the Company.

(**) 
 
 Due to the fact that the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data, the expected term was determined based on the "simplified method" in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110.

(***) 
 
 The Common Stock price, per share reflects the Company s management s estimation of the fair value per share of Common Stock as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. In reaching its estimation for such periods, management considered, among other things, a valuation prepared by a third-party valuation firm following the issuance of the Series C Units and the Series B Units, as applicable to each reporting period (See Note 3).

 Accounting Standards Update 2014-16,  Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity 

Effective January 1, 2016, the Group adopted Accounting Standard Update 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity ("ASU 2014-16").

The amendments in ASU 2014-16 clarify how U.S. GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. Specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features, including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of the host contract. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. The amendments also clarify that, in evaluating the nature of a host contract, an entity should assess the substance of the relevant terms and features (i.e., the relative strength of the debt-like or equity-like terms and features given the facts and circumstances) when considering how to weigh those terms and features. The assessment of the substance of the relevant terms and features should incorporate a consideration of the characteristics of the terms and features themselves; the circumstances under which the hybrid financial instrument was issued or acquired; and the potential outcomes of the hybrid financial instrument, as well as the likelihood of those potential outcomes.

The amendments in ASU 2014-16 apply to all entities that are issuers of, or investors in, hybrid financial instruments that are issued in the form of shares.

The effects of initially adopting the amendments in ASU 2014-16 were required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of shares as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. However, retrospective application was permitted to all relevant prior periods.

Management analyzed the economic characteristics and risks of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock (including the embedded conversion feature of each) in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2014-16 and determined that such instruments are considered as more akin to equity than debt. Accordingly, it was determined that the economic characteristics and the risks of the embedded conversion option to Common Stock and those of the Preferred Stock themselves (the 'host contract') are clearly and closely related and accordingly, the embedded conversion feature was not required to be bifurcated. As a result of the above determination, ASU 2014-16 did not impact the classification of the Series A Preferred Stock or the Series B Preferred Stock.

 Recently issued accounting pronouncements (cont.)

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09").

ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 also requires entities to disclose sufficient information, both quantitative and qualitative, to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

An entity should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 using one of the following two methods: 1. Retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented with a possibility to elect certain practical expedients, or, 2. Retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application. If an entity elects the latter transition method, it also should provide certain additional disclosures.

During 2016, the FASB issued several Accounting Standard Updates ( ASUs ) that focus on certain implementation issues of the new revenue recognition guidance including Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, Principal versus Agent Considerations and Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.

In accordance with a recent amendment to ASU 2014-09, introduced by Accounting Standard 2015-14,  Revenue from contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date , for a public entity, the amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period (the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 for the Company). Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.

The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, of ASU 2014-09 (including the amendments introduced through recent ASUs) on its consolidated financial statements.

 Accounting Standards Update 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern 

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ("ASU 2014-15").

ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management s responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable).

ASU 2014-15 also provides guidance related to the required disclosures as a result of management s evaluation. 

The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.

Due to the current financial condition of the Company and the existing uncertainty regarding its ability to continue as a going concern, management does not believe that the provisions of ASU 2014-15 will have a significant effect on its evaluation of the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However, management is currently considering if additional disclosures will be required as a result of ASU 2014-15.

In July, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) ("ASU 2015-11").

ASU 2015-11 outlines that inventory within the scope of its guidance be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) and the retail inventory method (RIM) are not impacted by the new guidance. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-11, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market (where market was defined as replacement cost, with a ceiling of net realizable value and floor of net realizable value less a normal profit margin).

For a public entity, the amendments in ASU 2015-11 are effective, in a prospective manner, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within the first such annual reporting period (the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 for the Company). Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.

The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial statements.

 RECENT EVENTS 

A. 
 
 During February 2016, the Company entered into an Advisory Agreement with AGI, pursuant to which the Company retained AGI on a non-exclusive basis to provide certain advisory services to the Company. As consideration for such services, the Company extended through December 31, 2019, the expiration date of 422,077 warrants issued to AGI and/or its designees in connection with the Company s common stock offering completed in 2010 and the Series A Unit offering completed in 2012. The Advisory Agreement had an initial term of six months, subject to automatic renewal for additional 30 day terms unless terminated by either party with 30 days written notice.  In April 2016, the Company and AGI amended that Advisory Agreement to extend the term of the Advisory Agreement for an additional six months.  In consideration for such extension, the Company agreed to modify the terms of the 439,674 warrants issued to AGI and/or its designees in connection with the Series B Unit offering to include full-ratchet anti-dilution protection. As a result of the two agreements the Company recorded in its statement of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, a one-time charge in the amount of $211,077 representing the incremental fair market value adjustments in respect of the above modified warrants issued to the placement agent. Such incremental fair market value adjustments represent the increase in the fair value of the warrants resulting from the above modifications and were recorded against stockholders  deficit. In addition, as a result of the inclusion of anti-dilution protection, the Company classified $341,662, representing the fair market value at April 2016 of the above 439,674 warrants issued to AGI out of stockholders deficit and presented them as Warrants with down round protection within long-term liabilities.

B. 
 
 During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company raised funds in an aggregate amount of approximately $4.52 million (net of related cash expenses) from the issuance in six separate closings of 5,323 Series C Units. As of September 30, 2016, the shares of Preferred Stock comprising the Series C Units are convertible into an aggregate of 1,186,000 shares of Common Stock, and the Series C Warrants comprising the Series C Units are exercisable for an aggregate of 2,372,000 shares of Common Stock, in each case subject to adjustment as described below.

Pursuant to a placement agent agreement (the  Placement Agent Agreement ) with AGI, at the initial closing of the sale of the Series C Units the Company paid AGI, as a commission, an amount equal to 6% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units, plus 4% of the aggregate sales price as a management fee plus a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 3% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units. At the end of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth closings of the sale of the Series C Units, the Company paid AGI, as a commission, an amount equal to 10% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units sold in such closing, plus a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 3% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units sold in such closing. In addition, pursuant to the Placement Agent Agreement, the Company is required to issue to AGI: (a) 5 year warrants to purchase up to 237,201 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share and (b) 5 year warrants to purchase up to 118,600 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $7.75 per share. The terms of such warrants will be substantially similar to the Series C Warrants except that the warrants issued to AGI will also be exercisable on a cashless basis and will include full ratchet anti-dilution protection.

Subject to certain ownership limitations described below, the Series C Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time and from time to time into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $4.50 per share (calculated by dividing the stated value per share of Preferred Stock, which is initially $1,000, by the conversion price per share). The conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment for certain issuances of Common Stock or other securities of the Company at an effective price per share that is lower than the conversion price then in effect, as well as for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares, similar recapitalization transactions and certain pro-rata distributions to common stockholders. In addition, the holders of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive any securities or rights to acquire securities or property granted or issued by the Company pro rata to the holders of Common Stock to the same extent as if such holders had converted all of their shares of Series C Preferred Stock prior to such distribution. In the event of a fundamental transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all assets and similar reorganizations or recapitalizations of the Company, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, upon conversion of their shares of Series C Preferred Stock, any securities or other consideration received by the holders of the Common Stock pursuant to the fundamental transaction.

Holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at a rate of 5.5% per annum, based on the stated value per share of Series C Preferred Stock. Dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock are payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning on June 30, 2016, and on each conversion date (with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock being converted). For so long as required under the terms of the Certificate of Designations for the Company s outstanding Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, dividends will be payable only in shares of Common Stock. Thereafter, dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will be payable, at the option of the Company, in cash and/or, if certain conditions are satisfied, shares of Common Stock or a combination of both. Shares of Common Stock issued as payment of dividends will be valued at the lower of (a) the then current conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock or (b) the average of the volume weighted average price for the Common Stock on the principal trading market therefor for the 10 trading days immediately prior to the applicable dividend payment date. The Company will incur a late fee of 9% per annum, payable in cash, on dividends that are not paid within three trading days of the applicable dividend payment date.

Subject to any limitations under the terms of the Certificate of Designations for the Company s outstanding Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, the Company may become obligated to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock in cash upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including, among others, a material breach by the Company of certain contractual obligations to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, the occurrence of a change in control of the Company, the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to the Company, or the failure of the Common Stock to continue to be listed or quoted for trading on one or more specified United States securities exchanges or a regulated quotation service. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, each holder of Series C Preferred Stock will have the option to require the Company to redeem such holder s shares of Preferred Stock for a redemption price payable in shares of Common Stock or receive an increased dividend rate of 9% on all of such holder s outstanding Series C Preferred Stock.

Subject to certain conditions contained in the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights relating to the Series C Preferred Stock (the  Certificate of Designations ), the Company will have the option to force the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock (in whole or in part) if (a) the volume weighted average price for the Common Stock on its principal trading market exceeds $7.00 for each of any 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period and the average daily dollar trading value for the Common Stock during such 30 day period exceeds $50,000 or (b) the Company receives approval to list the Common Stock on a national securities exchange.

Subject to certain exceptions contained in the Certificate of Designations, if the Company fails to timely deliver certificates for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock (the  Conversion Shares ) and, as a result, the holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such holder of the Conversion Shares (a  Buy-In ), the Company will be required to: (a) pay the converting holder in cash an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which such holder s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds the product of (i) the aggregate number of Conversion Shares due to the holder, multiplied by (ii) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions); and (b) at the option of such holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Series C Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock submitted for conversion (in which case, such conversion will be deemed rescinded) or deliver to such holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Company had timely complied with its delivery requirements. In addition, the Company will be required to pay partial liquidated damages of $10 for each $1,000 of stated value of any shares of Series C Preferred Stock which have been converted by a holder and in respect of which the Company fails to deliver Conversion Shares by the fifth trading day following the applicable conversion date and the Company will continue to pay such partial liquidated damages for each trading day after such eighth trading day until such certificates are delivered or the holder rescinds such conversion.

As long as at least 35% of the originally issued shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding, without the written consent of the holders of a majority in stated value of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock, the Company will not be permitted to, among other things, incur indebtedness or liens not permitted under the Certificate of Designations; repay, repurchase, pay dividends on or otherwise make distributions in respect of any shares of Common Stock or other securities junior to the Series C Preferred Stock; enter into certain transactions with affiliates of the Company; or enter into any agreement with respect to the foregoing.

Subject to the beneficial ownership limitation described below, holders of Series C Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. Holders will not be permitted to convert their Series C Preferred Stock if such conversion would cause such holder to beneficially own more than 4.99% of the outstanding Common Stock (subject to increase to 9.99%, at the option of the holder, upon no less than 61 days prior written notice to the Company) (the  Beneficial Ownership Limitation ). In addition, no holder may vote any shares of Series C Preferred Stock (on an as-converted to Common Stock basis) in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.

Subject to certain limitations, so long as any purchaser holds any shares of Series C Preferred Stock, if (a) the Company sells any shares of Common Stock or other securities convertible into, or rights to acquire, Common Stock and (b) a purchaser then holding Series C Preferred Stock, Warrants, Conversion Shares or Warrant Shares (defined below) reasonably believes that any of the terms and conditions appurtenant to such issuance or sale are more favorable to the purchaser in such subsequent sale of securities than are the terms and conditions granted to such purchaser after taking into account all of the terms and conditions of the terms granted to the purchasers under the purchase agreement and the terms granted in such subsequent issuance or sale, including all of the components of the Series C Units and of the securities or units involved in such subsequent issuance or sale, then the purchaser will be permitted to require the Company to amend the terms of this transaction (only with respect to such purchaser) so as to match the terms of the subsequent issuance (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any terms and provisions that are or may be less favorable to such purchaser).

The Series C Warrants have a five-year term commencing on their respective issuance dates. Until the end of the applicable term, each Series C Warrant will be exercisable at any time and from time to time at an exercise price of $4.50 per share (with respect to the Series C-1 Warrants) or $7.75 per share (with respect to the Series C-2 Warrants). The Series C Warrants contain adjustment provisions substantially similar to those to the adjustment provisions of the Series C Preferred Stock as described above, except that the Series C Warrants do not include dilution protection for issuances of securities at an effective price per share lower than the conversion price of such Series C Warrants. In addition, the Series C Warrants provide for protection for a Buy-In on substantially the same terms as described above with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock. No holder may exercise its Series C Warrants in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.

As a result of the initial issuance and sale of the Series C Units, pursuant to the terms of the Series A Warrants, on April 8, 2016, the exercise price per share of the Series A Warrants decreased from $5.80 per share to $4.50 per share and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each of the Series A Warrants, in the aggregate, increased such that the aggregate exercise price payable thereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the exercise price, will be equal to the aggregate exercise price prior to such adjustment. Also as a result of the initial issuance and sale of the Series C Units, pursuant to the terms of the certificates of designations for the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, on April 8, 2016, the conversion price per share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock decreased to $4.50 per share.

Based on the terms of the purchase agreements relating to the issuance and sale of the Series A Units and the Series B Units, respectively, so long as any initial purchaser of Series A Units or Series B Units, as applicable (each, a  Purchaser ) holds any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, if (1) the Company sells any shares of Common Stock or other securities convertible into, or rights to acquire, Common Stock and (2) a Purchaser then holding Series A or Series B Preferred Stock or Warrants reasonably believes that any of the terms and conditions appurtenant to such issuance or sale are more favorable to the purchaser in such subsequent sale of securities than are the terms and conditions granted to such Purchaser, then the Purchaser will be permitted to require the Company to amend the terms of this transaction (only with respect to such Purchaser) so as to match the terms of the subsequent issuance (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any terms and provisions that are or may be less favorable to such Purchaser).

Pursuant to the purchase agreements relating to the issuance and sale of the Series A Units and the Series B Units, the Company was required to and did notify the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock of the closing of the sale of the Series C Units,   and following receipt thereof such holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled, pursuant to the  most favored nation  provisions contained in their respective purchase agreements (as described above), to elect to amend the terms of their purchase of Series A Units and Series B Units, respectively, to match the terms of the Series C Units. The Company is obligated to amend the terms of any of Series A Units or Series B Units who timely makes such election and tenders its Series A Units or Series B Units for exchange.

Upon initial recognition, the Series C Preferred Stock issued together with detachable Series C Warrants (classified as equity) were measured based on the relative fair value basis and were presented net of the direct issuance expenses that were allocated to them.

The Company has determined that due to the economic characteristics and risks of the Series C Preferred Stock, based on their stated or implied substantive terms and features, that such Preferred Stock, are considered as more akin to equity than debt. Accordingly, it was determined that the economic characteristics and the risks of the embedded conversion option to Common Stock and those of the Series C Preferred Stock themselves (the 'host contract') are clearly and closely related. As a result, the embedded conversion feature was not required to be bifurcated.

Since at the issuance dates of the Series C Preferred Stock, the exercise price of the conversion feature (based on the effective conversion rate of the Series C Preferred Stock into Common Stock) was higher than the estimated fair value of the Company s Common Stock, it was determined that the conversion feature was not beneficial. Also, due to the liquidation preference and certain redemption rights for the benefit of the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, upon the occurrence of the certain contingent events, which are not considered as solely within the Company's control management determined that the Series C Preferred Stock were to be presented as temporary equity. On each balance sheet date, the Company s management assesses the probability of redemption of the outstanding Preferred Stock. In the event that management determines such redemption to be probable as of an applicable balance sheet date, the Company will recognize a liability in an amount equal to the aggregate redemption price of the Preferred Stock. In addition, upon such determination, the difference between the amount that was allocated to the Preferred Stock (after deduction of issuance expenses) and such redemption amount will be accreted over the period beginning on the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable and ending on the earliest redemption date.

 LOSS PER SHARE 

In periods of net loss, basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss for the period after consideration of the effect of dividend on preferred stock by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.

The loss and the weighted average number of shares used in computing basic and diluted loss per share for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

(*) 
 
 All outstanding convertible Preferred Stock, stock options and warrants have been excluded from the calculation of the diluted net loss per share for all the reported periods, because the effect of the common shares issuable as a result of the exercise or conversion of these instruments was anti-dilutive.

Overview

Integrity is a medical device company focused on the design, development and commercialization of non-invasive glucose monitoring devices for use by people with diabetes and pre-diabetics. Integrity Israel was founded in 2001 with a mission to develop, produce and market non-invasive glucose monitors for home use by diabetics. We have developed a non-invasive glucose monitor, the GlucoTrack  model DF-F glucose monitoring device, which is designed to help people with diabetes and pre-diabetics obtain glucose level readings without the pain, inconvenience, cost and difficulty of conventional (invasive) spot finger stick devices. The GlucoTrack  model DF-F utilizes a patented combination of ultrasound, electromagnetic and thermal technologies to obtain glucose measurements in less than one minute via a small sensor that is clipped onto one s earlobe and connected to a small, handheld control and display unit, all without drawing blood or interstitial fluid.

In June 2013, we received initial CE Mark approval for the GlucoTrack  model DF-F non-invasive glucose monitoring device from DEKRA Certification B.V., our European notified body (the  Notified Body ). This original approval required that the device be re-calibrated every 30 days, with each such re-calibration taking between 2.5 and 3 hours to complete. In March 2014 we received CE Mark approval for six months calibration validity of the same device. This approval eliminates the need for monthly re-calibrations, and enables the calibration process to be conducted only when the sensor is replaced, once every 6 months. We believe that this feature of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F is a significant feature of the device. Receipt of the CE Mark allows us to market and sell the GlucoTrack  model DF-F glucose monitoring device in European Union ( EU ) member countries that have adopted the European Medical Device Directive (the  MDD ) without being subject to additional national regulations with regard to demonstration of performance and safety. However, although the MDD is applicable throughout the EU, in practice it does not ensure uniform regulation throughout the EU.  Accordingly, member countries may apply and enforce the MDD s terms differently, and certain EU member countries may request or require performance and/or safety data additional to the MDD s requirements from time to time, on a case-by-case basis. The CE Mark also permits the sale in countries that have an MDD Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU.

On August 31, 2015, we received approval from the Notified Body for improvements to the GlucoTrack  model DF-F to simplify and shorten (from approximately 2.5 hours to approximately half an hour) the initial calibration process for the device. These improvements are intended to reduce the backlog created as purchasers of the device await calibration. In addition, we received approval from the Notified Body on the updated intended use for the device, which expands the intended user population to include not only Type 2 diabetics, but also people suffering from pre-diabetes conditions as well, which we believe represents a material expansion of the potential market for the device. In December 2015, we received approval from the Notified Body for further improvements to the GlucoTrack  model DF-F that increase the accuracy and efficacy of the device. On February 19, 2016, we received an extension of our ISO 13485:2003 certificate and Annex II certification from the EU.  The ISO 13485:2003 certification signifies that we have met the standards required for company-wide implementation of device quality management system(s).  The scope of the certification is design, development, manufacture and service of non-invasive glucose monitoring systems for home use.  Annex II also addresses quality control systems. The certification allows us to self-certify certain modifications and changes and simplifies some of the reporting to and review by the relevant Notified Body.  This can shorten the CE-mark review process of future GlucoTrack  model DF-F enhancements or revisions, including software updates and other improvements of the device that do not affect the intended use and/or safety performances. Without an Annex II certification, each new device enhancement or modified version would be subject to the full EU CE-mark review process.  The ISO 13485:2003 and Annex II certifications enable us to potentially reduce the time to market for product sales on new,  enhanced or modified GlucoTrack  model DF-F devices.

The GlucoTrack  model DF-F has not yet been approved for commercial sale in the United States. On August 10, 2015, we submitted pre-submission documents to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the  FDA ) in connection with our proposed future application for FDA approval of our U.S. clinical trial protocol.  The pre-submission documentation was submitted to the FDA in order to obtain the FDA s guidance regarding the U.S. regulatory pathway for the GlucoTrack  model DF-F, the proper approach to refining the trial protocol, and preparing the pre-marketing application. On October 19, 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss the pre-submission documents, including the approach to and details of the clinical trial protocol for the GlucoTrack  model DF-F. On May 10, 2016 we submitted a pre-submission supplement (including clinical trial protocol) to the FDA which reflects the feedback received from the FDA at our October 2015 meeting. On July 18, 2016, we completed a teleconference with the FDA to further discuss our pre-submission supplement. At the end of this discussion, we received verbal confirmation from the FDA that clinical trials of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F constitute non-significant risk device studies, which allows the trials to proceed without an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. Such trials are assessed by the FDA and not considered to present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or the welfare of subjects. We have identified and are currently negotiating agreements with two US diabetes and endocrinology institutions in the United States, as well as prominent endocrinologists to conduct the clinical trials as Prime Investigators. Subject to finalization of these agreements and to raising sufficient funds to do so, we expect to begin clinical trials in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2016 or first quarter of 2017.

We are continuing to work on improvements of certain features of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F, such as further simplifying the calibration process and improving the accuracy of the device.  Clinical trials conducted recently in Germany by Pfutzner Science   Health Institute, GmbH, headed by Prof. Dr. Andreas Pfutzner, on subjects with Type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetics, as well as at Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel, demonstrated favorable results, which were presented by the Company in the 16th annual Diabetes Technology Meeting (DTM), Bethesda, MD in an invited presentation on November 10.  Most notably, the presentation included data supporting that GlucoTrack s accuracy has been improved significantly. Results from the trials show 99.7% of the study data points within the clinically accepted A and B zones of the Consensus Error Grid (type 2), 99.3% of the study data points were within the clinically accepted A and B zones of the Clarke Error Grid, 17.0% Mean Absolute Relative Difference, and 12.9% Median Absolute Relative Difference. In addition, the German trial concluded that the data confirms the performance of the GlucoTrack  among its intended users, including pre-diabetic patients.

In addition, we are developing a wireless module ( WLM ) with embedded Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi technologies, which we expect will enable transmission of measurement data captured by the GlucoTrack  model DF-F to a cloud based server. We expect this module and the related applications, if successfully developed, to enable easy sharing, viewing and analysis of GlucoTrack  model DF-F glucose measurements and profile by clinicians and others. Subject to our raising sufficient funds to do so, we expect to complete the development of the WLM and related smartphone application as soon as the first quarter of 2017.

Since receiving CE Mark approval for our GlucoTrack  model DF-F glucose monitoring device, we have expanded our primary focus to include, in addition to research and development activities, preparation for anticipated future mass-production and distribution of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F in EU member countries and other countries that have an MDD Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU, as well as other countries which consider the CE Mark as a reference for their regulatory or registration requirements. We have entered into exclusive distribution agreements with more than 15 distributors, and we are continuing negotiations with distributors in additional territories. The effectiveness of these agreements, in many cases, is subject to the receipt of local regulatory approval or registration, if required, for the commencement of sales of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F in the subject territory.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will receive the required local regulatory approvals in any of the countries in which such approvals are required, and therefore we may never be permitted to commence commercial sales of our products in such territories. Further discussions with other potential distributors are in different stages. We recently signed a distribution agreement with a leading Taiwanese company and switched to a new Turkish distributor. Sales in Taiwan are subject to prior regulatory approval. Our new local distributor in Taiwan is negotiating with the regulatory authorities in accordance with contractual requirements and time frame. Among other jurisdictions, we are in the process of seeking regulatory approval for the GlucoTrack  model DF-F in China (where we have a distribution agreement in place) and Japan (where we do not yet have a distribution agreement in place), and are awaiting local regulatory approval in each of those countries.

On May 4, 2016 we received regulatory approval from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KMFDS, formerly KFDA) for the GlucoTrack  model DF-F.  In October this year we received the final approval from South Korea, which enables us to commence sales of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F in South Korea. Following the official approval, our local distributor placed an initial order for 100 units of GlucoTrack  model DF-F, which were fully paid for and delivered during the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect to recognize revenues from such order during the fourth quarter of 2016. In South Korea, the GlucoTrack  device is sold with 2 PECs, so the consumer does not need to incur further expenses to use the device in the first year. This marketing model may be adopted by other distributors as well.

Based on input from our local distributors and regulatory consultants, we estimated that we would complete the local regulatory approval review process in Japan and China by February 2017 and August 2016, respectively. However, we have been informed that the local regulatory bodies in Japan and China (PMDA and CFDA, respectively) have now required that we conduct additional clinical trials in their respective countries before they determine whether or not to approve the device to be marketed in such countries. Due to these developments, we now anticipate that the regulatory review process in Japan and China will take an additional 17 to 23 months, and potentially longer if the results of the additional clinical trials are not satisfactory to the local regulatory bodies or such regulatory bodies impose additional requirements for approval.

The territories covered by our signed distribution agreements currently represent a potential market opportunity of up to approximately 141 million diagnosed diabetics (inclusive of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients).  This represents approximately 34% of the potential worldwide market of approximately 414 million people, based on estimates included in the International Diabetes Federation s (IDF) Diabetes Atlas, 7 th  edition, 2015.  Of these territories, the territories in which the GlucoTrack  model DF-F has been approved for sale currently represent a potential market opportunity of up to approximately 23 million diagnosed diabetics (inclusive of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients), or 5.6% of the potential worldwide market. While we do not have reliable statistics that bifurcate the market opportunity among type 1 and type 2 diabetics, we believe that on average approximately 87% of all people suffering from diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Apart from the diagnosed patients, it is estimated that approximately 192 million people suffer from diabetes but have not yet been diagnosed.  Based on estimates included in the International Diabetes Federation s (IDF) Diabetes Atlas, 7 th  edition, 2015, the market opportunity for undiagnosed diabetics is 71 million people in the territories covered by our signed distribution agreements, of which 11 million people are in the territories in which the GlucoTrack  model DF-F has been approved for sale. Based on the IDF Diabetes Atlas, 6 th  edition, 2013 the world prevalence of pre-diabetics was 6.92% of the worldwide population, while the prevalence of diagnosed people with diabetes was 8.35%.

On November 9, 2016, the Company added two additional independent directors, bringing the total number of directors serving on our board of directors to 7, 5 of whom are independent. Additionally, the Company has recently formed a Compensation Committee and already has a Nominating and Corporate Governance committee, both consisting solely of independent directors.  The Company continues to consider expansion of the Board and the establishment of additional appropriate Board committees to support the Company.

In support of our global commercialization, sales and distribution efforts, the Company is currently in an active and progressing search for a Chief Commercialization Officer, as well as additional executives with the expertise and experience necessary to fully execute on the commercial opportunity.

We do not own commercial manufacturing facilities and do not intend to build commercial manufacturing facilities of our own in the foreseeable future. We currently utilize a third party manufacturer in Israel to manufacture the GlucoTrack  model DF-F.  In July 2014, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Wistron Corp. ( Wistron ), a Taiwanese entity and the manufacturing arm of Acer Inc.  Pursuant to such agreement, Wistron has agreed to mass produce and service, on a non-exclusive basis, the GlucoTrack    model DF-F and any future products, if any, introduced by us. Pursuant to such agreement, Wistron has also agreed to provide full turn-key manufacturing services for the GlucoTrack    model DF-F, including components procurement, unit assembly, device integration, testing, packaging and delivery to customers (distributors).  In November 2015, we sent a delegation to Wistron s main production facility in Taiwan to, among other things, inspect the readiness of Wistron s production line for the GlucoTrack  model DF-F. Wistron has produced a small pilot batch and recently produced a second pilot batch of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F device. A GMP audit by the local regulatory authorities in Taiwan was conducted in September 2016 and successfully completed. The production line for the GlucoTrack  model DF-F is now ready and we expect to receive an official clearance from the Taiwanese authorities shortly.  We intend to utilize the services of both Wistron and the Israeli third-party manufacturer to produce the GlucoTrack  model DF-F.

We have expanded our Advisory board to include renowned key opinion leaders, in order to support the Company s global clinical, regulatory and commercialization efforts. The advisory board now comprises six experts: Prof. Dr. Lutz Heinemann (Chairman): CEO, Science   Co, D sseldorf, Germany; Prof. Irl B. Hirsch: University of Washington, School of Medicine, WA, USA; Prof. Dr. Michael Heise: University of Applied Science of South-Westphalia, Iserlohn, Germany; Prof. Jan Bolinder: Professor of Clinical Diabetes Research at the Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Sweden; Prof. Katharine Barnard: Health Psychologist, Bournemouth University, Faculty of Health and Social Science, England; and Dr. Barry H. Ginsberg: Diabetes Consultant, DMTC, NJ, USA.

In support of the commercialization effort, we intend to conduct further post-market clinical trials, as well as publish scientific and clinical studies, case studies, and white papers. To that end, we have engaged with a leading clinic in Germany, Pfutzner Science   Health Institute, GmbH, headed by Prof. Dr. Andreas Pfutzner, to conduct additional clinical trials on subjects with Type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetics. We are in negotiations with another site in Israel and anticipate adding additional sites in Europe.

As a result of the improvements to the device that were submitted for approval in the second half of 2015 and approved in August and December 2015, we deliberately postponed sales of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F in the second half of 2015.  We held an international distributors  conference in October 2015 during which, we educated our international distributors about the improvements to the device and set the expectation to begin taking orders for the improved device in the first quarter of 2016.  In early 2016, after introducing the improved version of GlucoTrack  model DF-F, we received net orders totaling approximately $210,000, of which orders in the amount of $146,000 have been shipped and recognized as revenues during the nine months period ended September 30, 2016. We expect that the balance of such orders will be shipped and recognized as revenues during the fourth quarter of 2016.

We also received orders, totaling approximately $1.75 million that are contingent on the receipt of local regulatory approval to market the GlucoTrack  model DF-F in certain countries.  We delivered devices totaling $300,000 during the second quarter of 2016 for which we have received payments in the amount of $200,000 and the balance is expected to be paid during the fourth quarter of 2016. We cannot guarantee when the remaining orders in the amount of $1.45 million will be fulfilled (if at all), due to the pending local regulatory process, and we have not received any pre-payments for these orders.

As part of our commercialization activities, in September 2016, we had a booth at the EASD (European Association for Study of Diabetes) 52nd annual conference in Munich.  The Company received significant attention from endocrinologists, diabetologists and diabetes nurses and educators.

During the week of November 14, the Company will have a booth at Medica (in the Israeli pavilion). Medica is the largest exhibition for medical devices and equipment in the world, and takes place every November in D sseldorf, Germany. Our main purpose is to look for additional distributors, mainly in Europe.

In December 2016, we expect to have a poster at the 9th Annual World Congress on Prevention of Diabetes and its Complications (WCPD, Atlanta, GA). This Congress provides the Company with an opportunity to showcase our device as a tool to fight diabetes and its complications, as well as using GlucoTrack  model DF-F as a tool to assist pre-diabetics.

The Company is also seeking and in some discussions with potential strategic partners, to assist the Company in expanding its presence and penetration in various markets throughout the world. In connection with the foregoing, we have approached certain leading companies in the field of diabetes and glucose monitoring, as well as other relevant companies that may have an interest in expanding their fields of interest. We cannot guarantee that such activities will conclude in positive results to the Company, if any.

In addition to the improvements to the GlucoTrack  model DF-F described previously, we have also continued to work on additional incremental improvements to the device and the development of new devices and, subject to our raising sufficient funds to do so, intend to continue these efforts in 2016.  Specifically, we are developing a cloud-connected WLM.  We also initiated development of the next generation of GlucoTrack  model DF-F devices, as well as a simple model, DF-B, intended for use in developing countries.

We have not yet generated any material revenues from our operations and, as of September 30, 2016, have incurred an accumulated deficit of $34,189,683, stockholders  deficit of $9,937,906 and negative operating cash flows. We currently have no material sources of recurring revenue and therefore are dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in obtaining the necessary financing to continue our operations. As a result, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.

Recent Developments

As previously disclosed, during nine month period ended September 30, 2016 we raised funds in an aggregate amount of approximately $4.52 million (net of related cash expenses) from the issuance in six separate closings of 5,323 units (the  Series C Units ), each consisting of (a) one share of our newly designated Series C 5.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Series C Preferred Stock ), convertible into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Common Stock ), at an initial conversion price of $4.50 per share, (b) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $4.50 per share, up to such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series C Preferred Stock (each a  Series C-1 Warrant ) and (c) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $7.75 per share, up to such number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series C Preferred Stock (each a  Series C-2 Warrant  and, together with the Series C-1 Warrants, collectively, the  Series C Warrants ). As of September 30, 2016, the shares of Preferred Stock comprising the Series C Units are convertible into an aggregate of 1,186,000 shares of Common Stock, and the Series C Warrants comprising the Series C Units are exercisable for an aggregate of 2,372,000 shares of Common Stock, in each case subject to adjustments in certain circumstances.

Pursuant to a placement agent agreement (the  Placement Agent Agreement ) with Andrew Garrett, Inc. ( AGI ), the placement agent for the offering of the Series C Units, at the initial closing of the sale of the Series C Units we paid AGI, as a commission, an amount equal to  6% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units, plus 4% of the aggregate sales price as a management fee plus a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 3% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units.  At each of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth closing of the sale of the Series C Units, we paid AGI, as a commission, an amount equal to 10% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units sold in such closing, plus a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 3% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units sold in such closing. In addition, pursuant to the Placement Agent Agreement, we are required to issue to AGI: (a) 5 year warrants to purchase up to 237,201 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share and (b) 5 year warrants to purchase up to 118,600 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $7.75 per share.

As a result of the initial issuance and sale of the Series C Units, pursuant to the terms of the warrants issued by us to purchasers of units consisting of shares of its Series A 5% Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series A Preferred Stock ) and warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (the  Series A Warrants ), on April 8, 2016, the exercise price per share of the Series A Warrants decreased from $5.80 per share to $4.50 per share and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each of the Series A Warrants, in the aggregate, increased such that the aggregate exercise price payable thereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the exercise price, will be equal to the aggregate exercise price prior to such adjustment.   Also as a result of the initial issuance and sale of the Series C Units, pursuant to the terms of the certificates of designations for our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B 5.5% Convertible Preferred Stock (the  Series B Preferred Stock ), on April 8, 2016, the conversion price per share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock decreased to $4.50 per share.

Significant Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US. GAAP ). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our management believes that, as for the financial statements for the periods included in this report, the going concern assessment is a critical accounting policy. However, due to the early stage of operations of the Company, there are no other accounting policies that are considered to be critical accounting policies by management.

Going Concern Uncertainty

The development and commercialization of our product will require substantial expenditures. We have not yet generated any material revenues and have incurred a substantial accumulated deficit and negative operating cash flows. We currently have no sources of recurring revenue and are therefore dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in obtaining the necessary financing to continue our operations. Management s plans concerning these matters are described in Note 1B to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

1. 
 
 Accounting Standards Update 2014-16,  Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity 

Effective January 1, 2016, the Group adopted Accounting Standard Update 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity ("ASU 2014-16").

The amendments in ASU 2014-16 clarify how U.S. GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. Specifically, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features, including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of the host contract. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. The amendments also clarify that, in evaluating the nature of a host contract, an entity should assess the substance of the relevant terms and features (i.e., the relative strength of the debt-like or equity-like terms and features given the facts and circumstances) when considering how to weigh those terms and features. The assessment of the substance of the relevant terms and features should incorporate a consideration of the characteristics of the terms and features themselves; the circumstances under which the hybrid financial instrument was issued or acquired; and the potential outcomes of the hybrid financial instrument, as well as the likelihood of those potential outcomes.

The amendments in ASU 2014-16 apply to all entities that are issuers of, or investors in, hybrid financial instruments that are issued in the form of shares.

The effects of initially adopting the amendments in ASU 2014-16 were required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of shares as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. However, retrospective application was permitted to all relevant prior periods.

Management analyzed the economic characteristics and risks of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock (including the embedded conversion feature of each) in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2014-16 and determined that such instruments are considered as more akin to equity than debt. Accordingly, it was determined that the economic characteristics and the risks of the embedded conversion option to Common Stock and those of the Preferred Stock themselves (the 'host contract') are clearly and closely related and accordingly, the embedded conversion feature was not required to be bifurcated. As a result of the above determination, ASU 2014-16 did not impact the classification of the Series A Preferred Stock or the Series B Preferred Stock.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09").

ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 also requires entities to disclose sufficient information, both quantitative and qualitative, to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

An entity should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 using one of the following two methods: 1. Retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented with a possibility to elect certain practical expedients, or, 2. Retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application. If an entity elects the latter transition method, it also should provide certain additional disclosures.

During 2016, the FASB issued several Accounting Standard Updates ( ASUs ) that focus on certain implementation issues of the new revenue recognition guidance including Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, Principal versus Agent Considerations and Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.

In accordance with a recent amendment to ASU 2014-09, introduced by Accounting Standard 2015-14,  Revenue from contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date , for a public entity, the amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period (the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 for the Company). Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.

The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, of ASU 2014-09 (including the amendments introduced through recent ASUs) on its consolidated financial statements.

 Accounting Standards Update 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern 

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ("ASU 2014-15").

ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management s responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable).

ASU 2014-15 also provides guidance related to the required disclosures as a result of management s evaluation. 

The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted.

Due to the current financial condition of the Company and the existing uncertainty regarding its ability to continue as a going concern, management does not believe that the provisions of ASU 2014-15 will have a significant effect on its evaluation of the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. However, management is currently considering if additional disclosures will be required as a result of ASU 2014-15.

In July, 2015, The FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330) ("ASU 2015-11").

ASU 2015-11 outlines that inventory within the scope of its guidance be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) and the retail inventory method (RIM) are not impacted by the new guidance. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-11, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market (where market was defined as replacement cost, with a ceiling of net realizable value and floor of net realizable value less a normal profit margin).

For a public entity, the amendments in ASU 2015-11 are effective, in a prospective manner, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within the first such annual reporting period (the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 for the Company). Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.

The Company is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations

The following discussion explains material changes in our results of operations for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016, compared with the same periods ended September 30, 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

Revenues 

During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of $482,177 from orders for our GlucoTrack  model DF-F glucose monitoring device and personal ear-clip ( PEC ) that are replaced every six months, as compared with $143,167 for the prior-year period.  The increase in revenues resulted from increased orders from customers for our  improved GlucoTrack  model DF-F for which we received approval from the Notified Body on August 31, 2015 and December 2015.

We recognize revenues from sales of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F and PECs when delivery has occurred, persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and no further obligations exist.

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses were $2,226,833 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,596,494 for the prior-year period. The increase is attributable primarily to higher salary costs and related expenses resulting from increased head-count and higher salaries, higher materials expenses primarily as a result of the engagement of research and development in the initial manufacturing of  the GlucoTrack DF-F, and higher regulation related expenses relating primarily to our  efforts in seeking regulatory approval for the GlucoTrack  model DF-F in China .  Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, materials, travel expenses, clinical trials and other expenses. Subject to the receipt of additional funds to finance our operations (of which there can be no assurance), we expect research and development expenses to increase during the remainder of 2016 and beyond, primarily due to hiring additional personnel and developing our product line, as well as improvement of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F; but only if we are able to raise sufficient funds to do so. We may adjust or allocate the level of our research and development expenses based on available financial resources and based on our commercial needs, including the FDA registration process, specific requirements from customers, development of new GlucoTrack  models and others. Failure to raise sufficient funds both to commercialize our products and to complete desired research and development will delay improvements to our products.

Selling, Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses were $2,589,504 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,647,054 for the prior-year period. The increase is attributable primarily to higher salaries and related expenses relating to the hiring of our Chief Operating Officer on January 1, 2016 and the hiring of additional sales, marketing and business development personnel. The increase is also attributable to the one-time charges in the amount of $211,077 representing the incremental fair market value adjustments in respect of modified warrants issued to AGI (See Note 3). In addition, the increase is also attributable in part to higher professional fees primarily due to the engagement during the second quarter of 2015 of Ogilvy CommonHealth (Paris). Selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional services, salaries, travel expenses and other related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expenses. Other general and administrative costs and expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development costs and expenses, and professional fees for legal and accounting services. Subject to the receipt of additional funds to finance our operations (of which there can be no assurance), we expect selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses to increase in 2016 and beyond as we continue our focus on marketing and sales of the GlucoTrack    model DF-F.

- 31 - 

Financing (income) expenses, net 

Financing (income) expenses, net was $(63,654) for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to financing expense of $1,196,926 for the prior-year period. The change is primarily attributable to the non-cash loss on partial extinguishment of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A Warrants during the nine months period ended September 30, 2015 (see Note 10C to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015).

Net loss 

Net loss was $4,270,506 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a net loss of $4,297,307 for the prior-year period. The decrease in net loss is attributable primarily to the change in financing (income) expenses, net and increase in revenues offset partially by the increase in operating expenses, as described above.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to three Months Ended September 30, 2015

Revenues 

During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of $11,299 from orders for our GlucoTrack  model DF-F glucose monitoring device and PECs that are replaced every six months, as compared with $0   for the prior-year period.  The increase in revenues resulted from increased orders from customers for our  improved GlucoTrack  model DF-F for which we received approval from the Notified Body on August 31, 2015 and December 2015.

We recognize revenues from GlucoTrack  model DF-F and PEC when delivery has occurred, persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and no further obligations exist.

Research and development expenses 

Research and development expenses were $695,437 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $560,189 for the prior-year period. The increase is attributable primarily to higher salary costs and related expenses resulting from increased head-count and higher salaries  and higher regulation related expenses relating primarily to our  efforts in seeking regulatory approval for the GlucoTrack  model DF-F in China .  Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, materials, travel expenses, clinical trials and other expenses. Subject to the receipt of additional funds to finance our operations (of which there can be no assurance), we expect research and development expenses will increase during the remainder of 2016 and beyond, primarily due to hiring additional personnel and developing our product line, as well as improvement of the GlucoTrack  model DF-F; but only if we are able to raise sufficient funds to do so. We may adjust or allocate the level of our research and development expenses based on available financial resources and based on our commercial needs, including the FDA registration process, specific requirements from customers, development of new GlucoTrack  models and others. Failure to raise sufficient funds both to commercialize our products and to complete desired research and development will delay improvements to our products.

Selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses 

Selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses were $802,195 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $563,292 for the prior-year period. The increase is attributable primarily to higher salaries and related expenses relating to the hiring of our Chief Operating Officer on January 1, 2016 and the hiring of additional sales, marketing and business development personnel. The increase is also attributable in part to higher professional fees primarily due to the engagement during the second quarter of 2015 of Ogilvy CommonHealth (Paris). Selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional services, salaries, travel expenses and other related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expenses. Other general and administrative costs and expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development costs and expenses, and professional fees for legal and accounting services. Subject to the receipt of additional funds to finance our operations (of which there can be no assurance), we expect selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses to increase during the remainder of 2016 and beyond as we continue our focus on marketing and sales of the GlucoTrack    model DF-F; however, we may adjust or allocate the level of our marketing and general and administrative expenses based on available financial resources and based on our commercial needs including the FDA registration process, specific requirements from customers, development of new GlucoTrack  models and others.

Financing (income), net 

Financing income, net were $(31,589) for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to income of $(27,511) for the prior-year period. The change is primarily attributable to the non-cash change in fair value of Warrants with down round protection offset partially by the non-cash loss on partial extinguishment of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A Warrants incurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2015 (see Note 10C to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015).

Net Loss 

Net loss was $1,454,744 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1,095,970 for the prior-year period. The increase in net loss is attributable primarily to the increase in operating expenses, as described above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2016, cash on hand was approximately $0.7 million. During 2016 we started fulfilling orders for our improved GlucoTrack    model DF-F, which resulted in cash collections from our customers as of November 14, 2016 of approximately $599,000.  While we expect to continue to generate additional cash from sales, we do not anticipate that our income from operations will be sufficient to sustain our operations in the next 12 months.  Based on our current cash burn rate, strategy and operating plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand as of November 14, 2016 in the amount of approximately $123,000, will enable us to operate for a period of less than thirty days from the date of this report. In order to fund our anticipated liquidity needs beyond such period (or possibly earlier if our current cash burn rate, strategy or operating plan change in a way that accelerates or increases our liquidity needs), we will need to raise additional capital.

We have a credit line with Bank HaPoalim of NIS 150,000 (approximately $39,915 based on the exchange rate of 3.76 NIS/dollar as of September 30, 2016). Borrowings under the line of credit are secured by our funds on deposit with the bank at the time of borrowing, which generally must be sufficient to cover the principal amount of the borrowings in full. As of September 30, 2016 we did not utilize our credit line and as of November 14, 2016, our unutilized credit line amounted to approximately $26,000.

Messrs. Avner Gal and Zvi Cohen collectively loaned Integrity Israel NIS 176,000 ($46,833 based on the same exchange rate) in May 15, 2002 pursuant to a board approval. Messrs. Nir Tarlovsky, Yitzhak Fisher and Asher Kugler loaned Integrity Israel NIS 336,300 ($89,489 based on the same exchange rate) on March 16, 2004. These loans are not required to be repaid until the first year in which we realize profits in our annual statement of operations (accounting profit). At such time, the loans are to be repaid on a quarterly basis in an amount equal to 10% of our total sales in the relevant quarter, beginning on the quarter following the first year in which we realize profits in our annual statement of operations. The total amount to be repaid by us to each lender shall be an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount loaned by such lender to us, plus an amount equal to the product of the amount of each payment made by us in respect of such loan multiplied by the percentage difference between the Israeli Consumer Price Index on the date on which the loan was made and the Israeli Consumer Price Index on the date of such payment. However, notwithstanding the above-mentioned mechanism, we will not be required to repay the loans during any time when such repayment would cause a deficit in our working capital. Our board of directors is entitled to modify the repayment terms of these loans, so long as such modification does not discriminate against any particular lender, and provided that all payments must be allocated among the lenders on a pro-rata basis.

Integrity Israel is required to pay royalties to the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor of the State of Israel at a rate ranging between 3-5% of the proceeds from the sale of the Company s products arising from the development plan up to an amount equal to $93,300, plus interest at LIBOR from the date of grant. As of September 30, 2016, the contingent liability with respect to royalty payment on future sales equals to approximately $72,905, excluding interest.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities for the Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015

Net cash used in operating activities was $4,346,289 and $3,107,214 for the nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities primarily reflects the net loss of $4,270,506  and $4,297,307  for the nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was partially offset by the one-time charges in the amount of $211,077 representing the incremental fair market value adjustments in respect of modified warrants issued to AGI during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and loss on extinguishment of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A Warrants during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 in the amount of $1,284,354. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased our net cash used in operating activities for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 by $273,745, which resulted primarily from payment of deferred balances to suppliers. For the nine months period ended September 30, 2015 net cash used in operations decreased by $19,113 due to changes in operating assets and liabilities in the amount.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities for the Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015

Net cash used in investing activities was $75,269 and $118,993 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Net cash used to purchase equipment (such as computers, R D and office equipment) was $75,269 and $94,714, respectively and cash used to fund deposits in respect of employees rights upon retirement amounted to $0 and $24,279, for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities for the Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $4,503,611 and $(492,300) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 reflects net capital raised from the issuance of Series C units in the amounts of $4,517,140, offset partially by dividends paid to the holders of our Preferred Stock in the amounts of $13,529. Cash used in financing activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, reflects primarily the repayment of stockholders loan to Stockholders (see Note 9D to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015) in the amount of $439,939 and cash dividends paid to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock in the amounts of $52,361.

Item 4.            Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.  The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
