WASHINGTON REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016    
  (UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1:     NATURE OF BUSINESS    
    
  Washington Real Estate Investment Trust ( Washington REIT ), a Maryland real estate investment trust, is a self-administered, self-managed equity real estate investment trust, successor to a trust organized in 1960. Our business consists of the ownership and operation of income-producing real estate properties in the greater Washington metro region. We own a diversified portfolio of office buildings, multifamily buildings and retail centers.     
    
  Federal Income Taxes 
    
  We believe that we qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code and intend to continue to qualify as such. To maintain our status as a REIT, we are, among other things, required to distribute   90%   of our REIT taxable income (which is, generally, our ordinary taxable income, with certain modifications), excluding any net capital gains and any deductions for dividends paid to our shareholders on an annual basis. When selling a property, we generally have the option of (a) reinvesting the sales proceeds of property sold, in a way that allows us to defer recognition of some or all taxable gain realized on the sale, (b) distributing the gain to the shareholders with no tax to us or (c) retaining our net long-term capital gain but treating it as having been distributed to our shareholders, paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to our shareholders. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold the following properties: 

(1)   
    Land held for future development and an interest in a parking garage. 
               (2)   
    Maryland  Office Portfolio Transaction I consists of 6110 Executive Boulevard, Wayne Plaza, 600 Jefferson Plaza and West Gude Drive.  
               (3)   
    Maryland Office Portfolio Transaction II consists of 51 Monroe Street and One Central Plaza.           
       
  The taxable gains for Dulles Station II and the properties included in Maryland Office Portfolio Transaction I will be distributed to shareholders through the quarterly dividends. The properties included in Maryland Office Portfolio Transaction II were identified for a reverse tax deferred exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. We acquired the replacement property, Riverside Apartments, during the second quarter of 2016 (see note 3, under "Acquisition"). 
    
  Generally, and subject to our ongoing qualification as a REIT, no provisions for income taxes are necessary except for taxes on undistributed taxable income and taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs ). Our TRSs are subject to corporate federal and state income tax on their taxable income at regular statutory rates, or as calculated under the alternative minimum tax, as appropriate. During the second quarter of 2016, we recognized an income tax benefit of   $0.7 million   from a reduction of the reserve for a deferred tax asset at one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. As of   September 30, 2016  , our TRSs had net deferred tax assets of   $0.6 million  . Our TRSs had   no   net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, our TRSs had net deferred tax liabilities of   $0.5 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively. These deferred tax liabilities are primarily related to temporary differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue, amortization and depreciation.

NOTE 2:     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATIONS 
    
  Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  We have prepared our consolidated financial statements using the accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,   which provides specific guidance on how cash receipts and payments should be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows for eight specific issues. The new standard is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the new standard may have on Washington REIT s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,   which requires financial assets measured at an amortized cost basis, including trade receivables, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The new standard is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods therein with adoption one year earlier permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the new standard may have on Washington REIT s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which amends existing accounting standards for employee share-based payments, including by allowing an employer to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur or to continue to provide for an estimate as currently required. The new standard also allows an employer to withhold shares in a net settlement in an amount that does not exceed the maximum statutory tax rate in the employees' tax jurisdiction without causing liability classification. The new standard is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the new standard to have a material impact on Washington REIT s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)  , which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815, in and of itself, does not require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedging criteria continue to be met. The new standard is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the new standard may have on Washington REIT s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which amends existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including by requiring lessees to recognize most  leases on the balance sheet and making certain changes to lessor accounting. The new standard is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the majority of our revenue will be subject to the allocation provisions outlined within Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the specific implementation requirements for allocating the consideration within our contracts in accordance with ASU No. 2014-09. 
     
  In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810)  , which changes the analysis an entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Specifically, the new standard i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities, ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and iii) affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. The new standard is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods therein. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2016, and the provisions of the new standard did not have any impact on the consolidation of our legal entities. 
    
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which creates a single source of revenue guidance. The new standard provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers (unless the contracts are in the scope of other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requirements, such as the leasing literature). The guidance also provides a model for the measurement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets, such as property and equipment, including real estate. The new standard is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after  
  
   10 

December 15, 2017 and for interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for public entities beginning after December 15, 2016. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   the majority of our revenue will be subject to the allocation provisions outlined within the revenue standard. We are currently evaluating the specific implementation requirements for allocating the consideration within our contracts in accordance with ASU No. 2014-09. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Washington REIT, our majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which Washington REIT has a controlling interest, including where Washington REIT has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ( VIE ). See note 3 for additional information on the property for which there is a noncontrolling interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  We have prepared the accompanying unaudited financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In addition, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented have been included. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Within these notes to the financial statements, we refer to the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   as the    2016   Quarter  and the    2015   Quarter,  respectively, and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   as the "  2016   Period" and "  2015   Period," respectively. 
    
  Use of Estimates in the Financial Statements 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

NOTE 3:     REAL ESTATE 
    
  Acquisition 
    
  Our current strategy is focused on properties inside the Washington metro region s Beltway, near major transportation nodes and in areas with strong employment drivers and superior growth demographics. We seek to upgrade our portfolio with acquisitions as opportunities arise. Properties and land for development acquired during the 2016 Period were as follows: 

Riverside Apartments consists of apartment buildings and an adjacent parcel of land for potential future multifamily development. The results of operations from the acquired operating property are included in the consolidated statements of income as of the acquisition date and are as follows (in thousands): 

We record the acquired physical assets (land, building and tenant improvements), in-place leases (absorption, tenant origination costs, leasing commissions, and net lease intangible assets/liabilities), and any other liabilities at their fair values.  

11 

We have recorded the total purchase price of the above acquisition as follows (in thousands): 

The weighted remaining average life for 2016 acquisition components above, other than land and building, are    90   months for net lease intangible assets and   46   months for net lease intangible liabilities. The leasing commissions/absorption costs were substantially amortized by the end of the 2016 Quarter, as such costs were primarily related to assumed apartment leases. The net lease intangible assets and liabilities are associated with leases for retail space at Riverside Apartments. 
    
  The difference in the total contract price of    $244.8 million   for the acquisition and the acquisition cost per the consolidated statements of cash flows of   $243.4 million   is primarily due to credits received at settlement totaling   $1.4 million  . The portion of the acquisition cost allocated to land for development is reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows as Development in progress. 
    
  The following unaudited pro-forma combined condensed statements of operations set forth the consolidated results of operations for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   as if the above-described acquisition in 2016 had occurred on January 1, 2015. The pro forma adjustments include removing acquisition costs directly related to the above-described acquisition. The unaudited pro-forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the acquisitions had been in effect for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The unaudited data presented is in thousands, except per share data. 

Development/Redevelopment 
    
  In the office segment, we had a redevelopment project to renovate Silverline Center, an office property in Tysons, Virginia. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had invested   $36.3 million   in the renovation. We completed major construction activities on this project during the second quarter of 2015, and placed into service substantially completed portions of the project at that time totaling   $25.9 million  , with the remaining components placed into service as of March 31, 2016. We also currently have a redevelopment project at the Army Navy Club Building, an office property in Washington, DC, to upgrade its common areas and add significant amenities in order to make the property more competitive within its sub-market. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had invested   $0.9 million   in the redevelopment. 
    
  We have also begun predevelopment activities for the construction of a multifamily building on land adjacent to The Wellington in Arlington, Virginia. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had invested   $17.7 million   in the development. 
    
  Variable Interest Entities 
    
  In June 2011, we executed a joint venture operating agreement with a real estate development company to develop The Maxwell, a mid-rise multifamily property at 650 North Glebe Road in Arlington, Virginia. Major construction activities at The Maxwell ended during December 2014, and the building became available for occupancy during the first quarter of 2015. Washington REIT is the   90%   owner of the joint venture. The real estate development company owns   10%   of the joint venture and was responsible for the development and construction of the property. 
    
  We have determined that The Maxwell joint venture is a VIE primarily based on the fact that the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support. We also determined that Washington REIT was the primary beneficiary of the VIE due to the fact that Washington REIT was determined to have a controlling financial interest in the entity. As of   December 31, 2015  ,   $32.2 million   was outstanding on The Maxwell's construction loan. In January  
  
   12 

2016, Washington REIT exercised its right to purchase at par The Maxwell's construction loan from the original third-party lender. Upon the purchase, the loan became an intercompany payable from the consolidated VIE to Washington REIT that is eliminated in consolidation.  
    
  We include joint venture land acquisitions and related capitalized development costs on our consolidated balance sheets in properties under development or held for future development until placed in service or sold. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , The Maxwell's assets were as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , The Maxwell's liabilities were as follows (in thousands): 

(1)    The mortgage notes payable balance as of   September 30, 2016   is eliminated in consolidation due to the purchase of the loan by Washington REIT in January 2016. 
    
  Properties Sold and Held for Sale 
    
  We intend to hold our properties for investment with a view to long-term appreciation, to engage in the business of acquiring, developing and owning our properties, and to make occasional sales of the properties that no longer meet our long-term strategy or return objectives and where market conditions for sale are favorable. The proceeds from the sales may be reinvested into other properties, used to fund development operations or to support other corporate needs, or distributed to our shareholders. Depreciation on these properties is discontinued when classified as held for sale, but operating revenues, other operating expenses and interest continue to be recognized until the date of sale. There were no properties held for sale as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 
    
  During the 2016 Period, we sold Dulles Station, Phase II, which consists of land held for future development and an interest in a parking garage in Herndon, Virginia, for   $12.1 million  . Also during the   2016   Period, we executed   two   purchase and sale agreements with a single buyer for the sale of a portfolio of   six   office properties located in Maryland: 6110 Executive Boulevard, Wayne Plaza, 600 Jefferson Plaza, West Gude Drive, 51 Monroe Street and One Central Plaza (collectively, the "Maryland Office Portfolio") for an aggregate contract sales price of   $240.0 million  . We closed on the first sale transaction in June 2016 and closed on the second sale transaction in September 2016.  

13 

We sold the following properties in   2016   and   2015  : 

(1)   
    Land held for future development and an interest in a parking garage. 
               (2)   
    Maryland  Office Portfolio Transaction I consists of 6110 Executive Boulevard, 600 Jefferson Plaza, Wayne Plaza and West Gude Drive. 
               (3)   
    Maryland Office Portfolio Transaction II consists of 51 Monroe Street and One Central Plaza.           
               (4)   
    Interest in land held for future development. 
       
  While the Maryland Office Portfolio, in the aggregate, constitutes an individually significant disposition, it does not qualify for presentation and disclosure as a discontinued operation as it does not represent a strategic shift in our operations. Real estate rental revenue and net income for the Maryland Office Portfolio for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

(1)    Four of the Maryland Office Portfolio properties, 6110 Executive Boulevard, 600 Jefferson Plaza, Wayne Plaza and West Gude Drive, were sold on June 27, 2016, prior to the start of the 2016 Quarter. 
    
  We do not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the disposed properties. 
    
  Casualty Gains 
    
  We recorded a net casualty gain of   $0.7 million   during the 2016 Period associated with a fire at Bethesda Hill Towers that damaged four units, which is included in casualty (gain) and real estate impairment loss, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The net casualty gain is comprised of   $0.9 million   in third-party insurance proceeds received by us, which were partially offset by casualty charges of   $0.2 million   to write off the net book value of the damaged units at Bethesda Hill Towers.  

NOTE 4:     MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE 
    
  In January 2016, we exercised our right to purchase the construction loan in the amount of   $32.2 million   secured by The Maxwell without penalty from the lender (see note 3, under "Variable Interest Entities"). 
    
  In February 2016, we prepaid without penalty the remaining   $50.9 million   of the mortgage note secured by John Marshall II. 
    
  In June 2016, we repaid without penalty the remaining   $81.0 million   of mortgage notes secured by 3801 Connecticut Avenue, Bethesda Hill Apartments and Walker House Apartments.  
    
  Subsequent to the end of the 2016 Quarter, we prepaid without penalty the remaining   $101.9 million   of the mortgage note secured by 2445 M Street using borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.

NOTE 5:     UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT PAYABLE 
    
  We have a   $600.0 million   unsecured revolving credit agreement ("Revolving Credit Facility") that matures in   June 2019  , unless extended pursuant to one or both of the   two     six months   extension options. The Revolving Credit Facility has an accordion feature, which we utilized a portion of in September 2015, as described below, that allows us to increase the facility to   $1.0 billion  , subject to the extent the lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan commitments or term loans. In September 2015, we entered into a   $150.0 million   unsecured term loan ("2015 Term Loan") by executing a portion of the accordion feature under the Revolving Credit Facility. The 2015 Term Loan has a   5.5   year term and currently has an interest rate of   one month   LIBOR plus   110   basis points, based on Washington REIT's current unsecured debt ratings. We entered into   two   interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate at   2.7%   (see note   7  ). 
    
  The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of either   one month   LIBOR plus a margin ranging from   0.875%   to   1.55%   or the base rate plus a margin ranging from   0.0%   to   0.55%   (in each case depending upon Washington REIT s credit rating). The base rate is the highest of the administrative agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus   0.50%   and the LIBOR market index rate plus   1.0%  . In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires the payment of a facility fee ranging from   0.125%   to   0.30%   (depending on Washington REIT s credit rating) on the   $600.0 million   committed capacity, without regard to usage. As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the facility is one month LIBOR plus   1.00%   and the facility fee is   0.20%  . 
    
  The amount of the Revolving Credit Facility's unsecured line of credit unused and available at   September 30, 2016   is as follows (in thousands): 

We executed borrowings and repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility during the   2016   Period as follows (in thousands): 

NOTE 6:     NOTES PAYABLE 
    
  During the 2016 Quarter, we entered into a   seven   year,   $150.0 million   unsecured term loan ("2016 Term Loan") maturing on   July 21, 2023   with a deferred draw period of up to   six months   commencing on July 22, 2016. The 2016 Term Loan bears interest at a rate of either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from   1.50%   to   2.45%   or the base rate plus a margin ranging from   0.5%   to   1.45%   (in each case depending upon Washington REIT s credit rating). The base rate is the highest of the administrative agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus   0.50%   and the daily one-month LIBOR rate plus   1.0%  . The 2016 Term Loan currently has an interest rate of   one month   LIBOR plus   165   basis points, based on Washington REIT's current unsecured debt ratings. As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been   no   drawdowns on the 2016 Term Loan. We also entered into forward interest rate derivatives commencing on   March 31, 2017   to effectively fix the interest rate on the 2016 Term Loan at   2.9%   (see note   7  ). 

NOTE 7:     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
    
  On   September 15, 2015  , we entered into   two   interest rate swap arrangements with a total notional amount of   $150.0 million   to swap the floating interest rate under the 2015 Term Loan (see note   5  ) to an all-in fixed interest rate of   2.7%   starting on   October 15, 2015   and extending until the maturity of the 2015 Term Loan on   March 15, 2021  . On   July 22, 2016  , we entered into   two   forward interest rate swap arrangements with a total notional amount of   $150.0 million   to swap the floating interest rate under the 2016 Term Loan (see note   6  ) to an all-in fixed interest rate of   2.9%  , starting on   March 31, 2017   and extending until the maturity of the 2016 Term Loan on   July 21, 2023  .   
    
  The interest rate swaps qualify as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value in accordance with GAAP, based on discounted cash flow methodologies and observable inputs. We record the effective portion of changes in fair value of the cash flow hedge  
  
   15 

in other comprehensive loss. The resulting unrealized loss on the effective portions of the cash flow hedges was the only activity in other comprehensive loss during the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. We assess the effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The cash flow hedges were effective for the   2016   Quarter and Period and   2015   Quarter and Period, and hedge ineffectiveness did not impact earnings during the   2016   Quarter and Period and   2015   Quarter and Period.  
    
  The fair value and balance sheet locations of the interest rate swaps as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are as follows (in thousands): 

The interest rate swaps have been effective since inception. The net gains or losses on the effective swaps are recognized in other comprehensive loss, as follows (in thousands): 

Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt. During the next twelve months, we estimate that an additional   $1.8 million   will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. 
    
  We have agreements with each of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby we could be declared in default on our derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on the indebtedness. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives is in a net liability position of   $4.9 million  , which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If we had breached any of these provisions at   September 30, 2016  , we could have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of   $4.9 million  . 
    
  Derivative instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparty under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreement. We believe that we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major, creditworthy financial institutions. We monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity, thus minimizing our credit risk concentration. 

NOTE 8:     FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
    
  For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, quantitative disclosures about the fair value measurements are required to be disclosed separately for each major category of assets and liabilities, as follows: 
    
  Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
  Level 2: Significant other observable inputs 
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs 
    
  The only assets or liabilities we had at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are the assets held in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"), which primarily consists of investments in mutual funds, and the interest rate swaps (see note   7  ).  
    
  We base the valuations related to the SERP on assumptions derived from significant other observable inputs and accordingly these valuations fall into Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  
  
   16 

The valuation of the interest rate swaps is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each interest rate swap. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate swaps, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments (or receipts) and the discounted expected variable cash receipts (or payments). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments in the fair value measurements to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk. These credit valuation adjustments were concluded to not be significant inputs for the fair value calculations for the periods presented. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as the posting of collateral, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. The valuation of interest rate swaps fall into Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The fair values of these assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows (in thousands): 

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value 
    
  The following disclosures of estimated fair value were determined by management using available market information and established valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow. Many of these estimates involve significant judgment. The estimated fair value disclosed may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts we could realize on disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies could have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts. In addition, fair value estimates are made at a point in time and thus, estimates of fair value subsequent to   September 30, 2016   may differ significantly from the amounts presented. 
    
  Following is a summary of significant methodologies used in estimating fair values and a schedule of fair values at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash include cash and commercial paper with original maturities of less than   90   days, which are valued at the carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments (Level 1 inputs).   
    
  Notes Receivable 
    
  We acquired a note receivable ("2445 M Street note") in 2008 with the purchase of 2445 M Street.  We estimate the fair value of the 2445 M Street note based on a discounted cash flow methodology using market discount rates (Level 3 inputs).  
    
  Debt 
    
  Mortgage notes payable consist of instruments in which certain of our real estate assets are used for collateral. We estimate the fair value of the mortgage notes payable by discounting the contractual cash flows at a rate equal to the relevant treasury rates (with respect to the timing of each cash flow) plus credit spreads estimated through independent comparisons to real estate assets or loans with similar characteristics. Lines of credit payable consist of our bank facility which we use for various purposes including working capital, acquisition funding and capital improvements. The lines of credit advances are priced at a specified rate plus a spread. We estimate the market value based on a comparison of the spreads of the advances to market given the adjustable base rate. We estimate the fair value of the notes payable by discounting the contractual cash flows at a rate equal to the relevant treasury rates (with respect to the timing of each cash flow) plus credit spreads derived using the relevant securities  market prices. We  
  
   17 

classify these fair value measurements as Level 3 as we use significant unobservable inputs and management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices.    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying values and estimated fair values of our financial instruments were as follows (in thousands): 

NOTE 9:     STOCK BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  Washington REIT maintains short-term ("STIP") and long-term ("LTIP") incentive plans that allow for stock-based awards to officers and non-officer employees. Stock based awards are provided to officers and non-officer employees, as well as trustees, under the Washington Real Estate Investment Trust 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan which allows for awards in the form of restricted shares, restricted share units, options and other awards up to an aggregate of   2,400,000   shares over the   ten  -year period in which the plan will be in effect. Restricted share units are converted into shares of our stock upon full vesting through the issuance of new shares. 
    
  In February 2016, we adopted a revised long-term incentive plan ("New LTIP") for non-executive officers and other employees that replaced the previous long-term incentive plan for non-executive officers and other employees. The New LTIP is effective January 1, 2016 for performance years beginning on or after that date. Non-executive officers and other employees earn restricted share unit awards under the New LTIP based upon various percentages of their salaries and annual performance calculations. The restricted share unit awards vest ratably over   three   years beginning on the grant date based upon continued employment. We initially measure compensation expense for awards under the New LTIP based on the fair value at the grant date, and recognize compensation expense for these awards according to a graded vesting schedule over the   three  -year requisite service period.  
    
  Total Compensation Expense 
    
  Total compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for all outstanding share based awards was   $0.3 million   and   $0.9 million   for the   2016   Quarter and   2015   Quarter, respectively, and   $2.7 million   and   $4.0 million   for the   2016   Period and   2015   Period, respectively. 
    
  Restricted Share Awards 
    
  The total fair values of restricted share awards vested was   $2.5 million   and   $2.6 million   for the   2016   Period and   2015   Period, respectively. 
    
  The total unvested restricted share awards at   September 30, 2016   was   210,366   shares, which had a weighted average grant date fair value of   $26.37   per share. As of   September 30, 2016  , the total compensation cost related to unvested restricted share awards was   $2.4 million  , which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of   21   months.  
  
   18 

NOTE 10:     EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 
    
  We determine  Basic earnings per share  using the two-class method as our unvested restricted share awards and units have non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and are therefore considered participating securities. We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to the controlling interest less the allocation of undistributed earnings to unvested restricted share awards and units by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. 
    
  We also determine  Diluted earnings per share  as the more dilutive of the two-class method or the treasury stock method with respect to the unvested restricted share awards. We further evaluate any other potentially dilutive securities at the end of the period and adjust the basic earnings per share calculation for the impact of those securities that are dilutive. Our diluted earnings per share calculation includes the dilutive impact of our share based awards with performance conditions prior to the grant date and awards with market conditions under the contingently issuable method. 
    
  The computations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 

NOTE 11:     SEGMENT INFORMATION 
    
  We have   three   reportable segments: office, multifamily and retail. Office properties provide office space for various types of businesses and professions. Multifamily properties provide rental housing for individuals and families throughout the Washington metro region. Retail properties are typically grocery store-anchored neighborhood centers that include other small shop tenants or regional power centers with several junior box tenants.  
    
  We evaluate performance based upon net operating income from the combined properties in each segment. Our reportable operating segments are consolidations of similar properties. GAAP requires that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segments  performance. Net operating income is a key measurement of our segment profit and loss. Net operating income is defined as segment real estate rental revenue less segment real estate expenses. 
    
  The following tables present revenues, net operating income, capital expenditures and total assets for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   from these segments, and reconcile net operating income of reportable segments to net income attributable to the controlling interests as reported (in thousands): 
  
   19 

20 

NOTE 12:     SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY    
    
  On May 4, 2016, we issued approximately   5.3 million   common shares, including   693,750   shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option, at a price to the public of   $28.20   per share. We received net proceeds of approximately   $143.4 million  . 
    
  On June 23, 2015, we entered into four separate equity distribution agreements (collectively, the  Equity Distribution Agreements ) with each of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and RBC Capital  
  
   21 

Markets, LLC relating to the issuance of up to   $200.0 million   of our common shares from time to time. Issuances of our common shares are made at market prices prevailing at the time of issuance. We may use net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under this program for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, working capital, the acquisition, renovation, expansion, improvement, development or redevelopment of income producing properties or the repayment of debt. During the 2016 Quarter and Period, we issued   0.9 million   common shares under the Equity Distribution Agreements at a weighted average price of   $33.32   per share, raising   $29.6 million   in net proceeds. 
    
  We have a dividend reinvestment program, whereby shareholders may use their dividends and optional cash payments to purchase common shares. The common shares sold under this program may either be common shares issued by us or common shares purchased in the open market. During the 2016 Quarter and Period, we issued approximately   17,500   common shares under this program at a weighted average price of   $31.21   per share, raising   $0.5 million   in net proceeds.

General 
    
  Introductory Matters 
    
  We provide our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We organize the MD A as follows: 

Overview.   Discussion of our business outlook, operating results, investment activity, financing activity and capital requirements to provide context for the remainder of MD A. 
                 
    Liquidity and Capital Resources.   Discussion of our financial condition and analysis of changes in our capital structure and cash flows.

Funds From Operations  . Calculation of NAREIT Funds From Operations ("NAREIT FFO"), a non-GAAP supplemental measure to net income. 
                
    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.   Descriptions of accounting policies that reflect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
       
  When evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, we focus on the following financial and non-financial indicators: 

Net operating income ( NOI )  , calculated as real estate rental revenue less real estate expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses. NOI is a non-GAAP supplemental measure to net income. 
                
    NAREIT FFO  , calculated as set forth below under the caption  Funds from Operations.   
                
    Occupancy  , calculated as occupied square footage as a percentage of total square footage as of the last day of that period. 
                
    Leased percentage  , calculated as the percentage of available physical net rentable area leased for our office and retail segments and percentage of apartments leased for our multifamily segment. 
                
    Rental rates. 
                
    Leasing activity  , including new leases, renewals and expirations. 
       
  For purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance, we categorize our properties as  same-store ,  non-same-store  or discontinued operations.       A "same-store" property is one that was owned for the entirety of 2016 and the prior year, and excludes properties under redevelopment or development and properties purchased or sold at any time during 2016 or the prior year. A "non-same-store" property is one that was acquired, under redevelopment or development, or placed into service during 2016 or the prior year. We define redevelopment properties as those for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs on existing or acquired buildings pursuant to a formal plan which has a current impact on operating results, occupancy and the ability to lease space with the intended result of a higher economic return on the property. Properties under redevelopment or development are included within the non-same-store properties beginning in the period during which redevelopment or development activities commence. We consider properties to no longer be under redevelopment or development upon substantial completion of redevelopment or development activities, and the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy or two years after substantial completion. 
    
  Overview 
    
  Business Outlook 
    
  Our revenues are derived primarily from the ownership and operation of income-producing properties in the greater Washington metro region. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a diversified portfolio of   49   properties, totaling approximately   6.0 million   square feet of commercial space and   4,480   multifamily units, and land held for development. These   49   properties consisted of   19   office properties,   16   retail centers and   14   multifamily properties.  
    
  In accordance with our strategy of recycling legacy assets to invest in high-quality assets with compelling value-add returns, in April 2016 we executed   two   purchase and sale agreements with a single buyer for the sale Maryland Office Portfolio for an aggregate contract sale price of   $240.0 million  . We closed on the first sale transaction for four of the properties in June 2016 and closed on the second sale transaction in September 2016. In May 2016, we acquired a multifamily property, Riverside Apartments, with further development potential in Alexandria, Virginia, for   $244.8 million   (see "Investment Activity" below).    
    
  Operating Results 
    
  Net income attributable to the controlling interests, NOI and NAREIT FFO for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (in thousands):    
  
   23 

The higher net income attributable to the controlling interests is primarily due to gains on sale of real estate (  $77.6 million  ) and lower interest expense ($1.3 million) in the 2016 Quarter.  
    
  The increase in NOI is primarily due to acquisitions ($3.0 million), the lease-up of Silverline Center ($1.1 million) and The Maxwell ($0.4 million), and higher NOI from same-store properties ($0.7 million). These were partially offset by the property sales during 2015 and 2016 ($4.1 million) and lower occupancy at the Army Navy Club Building ($0.6 million), which is under re-development. The higher same-store NOI was primarily due to higher rental rates ($0.8 million) and reimbursements ($0.4 million), partially offset by higher real estate taxes ($0.5 million). Same-store physical occupancy increased to   94.2%   as of   September 30, 2016  , from   92.9%   one year ago, primarily due to higher occupancy in the office and multifamily segments. 
    
  The higher NAREIT FFO is primarily attributable to the lower interest expense ($1.3 million), lower acquisition costs ($0.9 million) and higher NOI (  $0.5 million  ) in the 2016 Quarter. 
    
  Investment Activity 
    
  Significant investment transactions during the 2016 Period included the following: 
             
    The acquisition of Riverside Apartments, a multifamily property consisting of three buildings totaling   1,222 units   in Alexandria, Virginia, and an adjacent undeveloped land parcel with potential to develop approximately 550 additional units, in May 2016 for a contract purchase price of   $244.8 million  . We incurred $1.2 million of acquisition costs. 
                
    The sale of Dulles Station, Phase II, which consisted of land held for future development and an interest in a parking garage in Herndon, Virginia, in May 2016 for $12.1 million. We recognized a gain on sale of real estate of   $0.5 million  . 
                
    The completion of the first sale transaction with respect to the Maryland Office Portfolio (for the sale of 6110 Executive Boulevard, Wayne Plaza, 600 Jefferson Plaza and West Gude Drive) in June 2016 for   $111.5 million  . We recognized a gain on sale of real estate of   $23.6 million  .  
                
    The completion of the second sale transaction with respect to the Maryland Office Portfolio (for the sale of 51 Monroe Street and One Central Plaza) in September 2016 for   $128.5 million  . We recognized a gain on sale of real estate of   $77.6 million  .  
       
  Financing Activity 
    
  Significant financing transactions during the 2016 Period included the following: 
             
    The exercise of our right to purchase the   $32.2 million   construction loan secured by The Maxwell without penalty from the lender in January 2016. 
                
    The prepayment at par of the remaining   $50.9 million   of the mortgage note secured by John Marshall II in February 2016. 
                 
    The repayment of the remaining   $81.0 million   of mortgage notes secured by 3801 Connecticut Avenue, Bethesda Hill Apartments and Walker House Apartments in June 2016.  
                
    The execution in July 2016 of a seven year, $150 million unsecured term loan agreement maturing on July 21, 2023 with a deferred draw period of up to six months. We expect to draw on the term loan in the fourth quarter of 2016 or early in January 2017 to refinance maturing secured debt. We also entered into interest rate derivatives to swap from a LIBOR plus 165 basis points floating rate to a 2.86% all-in fixed interest rate commencing on March 31, 2017. 
                
    The issuance of approximately 0.9 million common shares under our ATM program at a weighted average price to the public of   $33.32   per share, for net proceeds of approximately   $29.6 million  .  
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was one month LIBOR plus 1.00% and the facility fee was 0.20%. As of   October 28, 2016  , our Revolving Credit Facility has a borrowing capacity of   $362.0 million  .

Capital Requirements 
    
  Subsequent to the end of the 2016 Quarter, we prepaid without penalty the remaining $101.9 million of the mortgage note secured by 2445 M Street using borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility. We do not have any debt maturities during the remainder of 2016. We expect to have the additional capital requirements as set forth on page 33 (Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Requirements). 

Results of Operations 
    
  The discussion that follows is based on our consolidated results of operations for the   2016   Quarter and   2015   Quarter and   2016   Period and   2015   Period. The ability to compare one period to another is significantly affected by acquisitions completed and dispositions made during   2016   and   2015   (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). 
  Net Operating Income 
    
  NOI is a non-GAAP measure calculated as real estate rental revenue less real estate expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses. NOI is the primary performance measure we use to assess the results of our operations at the property level. We believe that NOI is useful as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations of trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results more closely related to a property s results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. As a result of the foregoing, we provide NOI as a supplement to net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP. NOI does not represent net income or income from continuing operations, in either case calculated in accordance with GAAP.  As such, it should not be considered an alternative to these measures as an indication of our operating performance. A reconciliation of NOI to net income follows.

    Retail  :   Increase   primarily due to higher reimbursements ($0.4 million) and rental rates ($0.3 million), partially offset by lower occupancy ($0.2 million). The higher reimbursements were primarily due to higher expenses. 
       
  Real estate rental revenue from acquisitions increased due to the acquisition of Riverside Apartments in the second quarter of 2016.  
    
  Real estate rental revenue from development/redevelopment properties increased primarily due to higher occupancy ($1.1 million) at Silverline Center and The Maxwell ($0.4 million), partially offset by lower occupancy ($0.6 million) at the Army Navy Club Building, which is under redevelopment.  
    
  Occupancy represents occupied square footage indicated as a percentage of total square footage as of the last day of that period. Occupancy by segment for the   2016   Quarter and   2015   Quarter was as follows: 

Office  : The increase in same-store occupancy was primarily due to higher occupancy at 1775 Eye Street and 1600 Wilson Boulevard, partially offset by lower occupancy at Monument II. The decrease in non-same-store occupancy was primarily  
     
   27 

due to lower occupancy at the Army Navy Club Building, which is under redevelopment, partially offset by higher occupancy at Silverline Center. 
             
    Multifamily  : The increase in same-store occupancy was primarily due to higher occupancy at the Kenmore, partially offset by lower occupancy at The Ashby. The increase in non-same-store occupancy was primarily due to the lease-up of The Maxwell. 
                
    Retail  : The increase in same-store occupancy was primarily due to higher occupancy at Bradlee Shopping Center, partially offset by lower occupancy at Spring Valley Shopping Center.

  Real Estate Expenses 
    
  Real estate expenses as a percentage of revenue for the   2016   Quarter and   2015   Quarter were   36.6%   and   35.9%  , respectively. 
    
  Real estate expenses from same-store properties by segment were as follows (in thousands):

  Depreciation and Amortization  : Increase primarily due to acquisitions ($4.1 million) and placing the Silverline Center redevelopment into service ($0.7 million), partially offset by dispositions ($3.1 million). 
    
  Acquisition Costs  : Decrease primarily due to the settlement of the The Wellington acquisition during the 2015 Quarter. 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses:   Decrease primarily due to lower share-based compensation ($0.5 million) primarily due to a higher volume of forfeitures during the 2016 Quarter, partially offset by a higher estimate of short-term incentive compensation ($0.2 million).  
    
  Gain on sale of real estate:   Increase due to settling on the sales of 51 Monroe Street and One Central Plaza during the 2016 Quarter.  
    
  Interest Expense  : Interest expense by debt type for the three months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   were as follows (in thousands): 

28 

Notes payable  :   Increase   primarily due to executing the $150.0 million term loan in September 2015, which has a floating interest rate effectively fixed at 2.7% by interest rate swaps. 
                
    Mortgage notes payable  :   Decrease   primarily due to the repayment of the mortgage notes secured by John Marshall II, 3801 Connecticut Avenue, Bethesda Hill Apartments and Walker House Apartments, and the purchase of the construction loan secured by The Maxwell (a consolidated entity) during the   2016   Period. 
                
    Lines of credit  : Small decrease primarily due to weighted average daily borrowings of $240.7 million during   2016   Quarter, as compared to $313.3 million during the   2015   Quarter, partially offset by a higher weighted average borrowing rate. 
                
    Capitalized interest  :   Increase   primarily due to capitalization of interest on spending related to the development adjacent to The Wellington.

    Recoveries from tenants:     Increase   primarily due to higher reimbursements for operating ($0.6 million) and real estate tax ($0.2 million) expenses, primarily due to higher expenses. 
                
    Provision for doubtful accounts:     Decrease   primarily due to lower provisions in the office segment ($0.4 million). 
                
    Lease termination fees  :   Increase   primarily due to higher fees in the multifamily ($0.1 million) and office ($0.1 million) segments. 
                
    Parking and other tenant charges  :   Increase   primarily due to higher parking income ($0.4 million), short-term rents ($0.2 million) and percentage rent ($0.1 million).  
       
  Real estate rental revenue from same-store properties by segment was as follows (in thousands): 

Office  :   Increase   primarily due to higher rental rates ($1.5 million), lower provisions for uncollectible accounts ($0.4 million), higher reimbursements ($0.3 million) and higher parking income ($0.3 million), partially offset by higher rent abatements ($0.7 million) and lower occupancy ($0.4 million). 
                
    Multifamily  :   Increase   primarily due to lower rent abatements ($0.3 million) and higher tenant fees ($0.3 million). 
                
    Retail  :   Increase   primarily due to higher rental rates ($1.1 million), reimbursements ($0.6 million), percentage rent ($0.1 million) and parking income ($0.1 million), partially offset by lower occupancy ($1.5 million). The higher reimbursements were primarily due to higher expenses. 
       
  Real estate rental revenue from acquisitions increased due to the acquisitions of Riverside Apartments ($7.9 million) in the second quarter of 2016 and The Wellington ($6.5 million) in the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  Real estate rental revenue from development/redevelopment properties increased primarily due to higher occupancy at The Maxwell ($2.2 million) and Silverline Center ($1.6 million), partially offset by lower occupancy ($1.0 million) at the Army Navy Club Building, which is under redevelopment.  
    
  During the   2016   Period, we executed new and renewal leases in our office and retail segments as follows: 

(1)    Consists of tenant improvements and leasing commissions.  
    
  Real Estate Expenses 
    
  Real estate expenses as a percentage of revenue for the   2016   Period and   2015   Period were   36.4%   and   37.2%  , respectively. 
    
  Real estate expenses from same-store properties by segment were as follows (in thousands): 

31 

Office  :   Increase   primarily due to higher real estate tax ($0.2 million), bad debt ($0.2 million) and custodial ($0.1 million) expenses, partially offset by lower utilities expenses ($0.4 million). 
                
    Multifamily  :   Decrease   primarily due to lower administrative expenses ($0.2 million).

  Other Income and Expenses 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization  : Increase primarily due to the acquisition of The Wellington and Riverside Apartments ($7.3 million) and higher depreciation at development/redevelopment properties ($0.6 million), partially offset by the disposition of properties ($5.6 million). 
    
  Acquisition Costs  : Decrease primarily due to lower costs associated with the Riverside Apartments acquisition in the 2016 Period, as compared to the costs associated with The Wellington acquisition during the 2015 Period. 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses:   Decrease primarily due to lower share-based compensation ($1.1 million) primarily due to a higher number of forfeitures during the 2016 Period and lower consulting fees ($0.2 million), partially offset by a higher estimate of short-term incentive compensation ($1.1 million).  
    
  Casualty gain and impairment (loss), net:   The casualty gain in the 2016 Period represents the gain recognized upon the receipt of insurance proceeds related to damage from a fire at Bethesda Hill Towers during the first quarter of 2015 that damaged four units. The impairment loss in the second quarter of 2015 reduced the carrying value of our interest in a joint venture to develop a multifamily property at 1225 First Street to its estimated fair value. We subsequently disposed of our interest in the joint venture during the 2015 Quarter.  
    
  Gain on sale of real estate:   Increase due to completion of the sales of Dulles Station II and the Maryland Office Portfolio during the 2016 Period, as compared to the gain on the sale of Country Club Towers during the 2015 Period. 
    
  Interest Expense  : Interest expense by debt type for the   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   were as follows (in thousands): 

Notes payable  :   Increase   primarily due to executing the $150.0 million term loan in September 2015, which has a floating interest rate effectively fixed at 2.7% by interest rate swaps, partially offset by the repayment of $150.0 million of our 5.35% senior notes in May 2015. 
                
    Mortgage notes payable  :   Decrease   primarily due to the repayment of the mortgage notes secured by John Marshall II, 3801 Connecticut Avenue, Bethesda Hill Apartments and Walker House Apartments, and the purchase of the construction loan secured by The Maxwell (a consolidated entity) during the   2016   Period. 
                 
    Capitalized interest  :   Decrease   primarily due to placing into service our development project at The Maxwell and redevelopment project at Silverline Center, partially offset by capitalization of interest on spending related to the development adjacent to The Wellington. 
       
  Income tax benefit (expense):   The income tax benefit in the 2016 Period resulted from a reduction of the valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset at one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries due to a net operating loss as a result of the sale of Dulles Station II.  We have concluded that there is sufficient positive evidence as of   September 30, 2016   that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss is realizable. 

32 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Capital Requirements 
    
  As of the end of the   third   quarter of   2016  , we summarize our   2016   capital requirements as follows: 
             
    Funding dividends and distributions to our shareholders; 
                 
    Approximately $60 - $65 million to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets, including approximately $40 - $45 million to fund tenant-related capital requirements and leasing commissions; and 
                
    Approximately $5 - $10 million to invest in our development and redevelopment projects. 
       
  Debt Financing 
    
  Our total debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows (in thousands): 

Mortgage Notes Payable 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our mortgage notes payable bore an effective weighted average fair value interest rate of   5.3%   and had an estimated weighted average maturity of   2.1   years. We may either initiate secured mortgage debt or assume mortgage debt from time-to-time in conjunction with property acquisitions.  
    
  Our mortgage notes contain covenants with which we must comply. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under our mortgage notes could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments. This could cause our debt holders to accelerate the timing of payments and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with our mortgage notes covenants. 
    
  Lines of Credit and Term Loan 
    
  Our primary source of liquidity is our Revolving Credit Facility, a $600.0 million unsecured credit agreement that matures in June 2019, unless extended pursuant to one or both of the two six-month extension options. The Revolving Credit Facility has an accordion feature that allows us to increase the facility to $1.0 billion, subject to the extent the lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan commitments or term loans. In September 2015, we entered into a $150.0 million unsecured term loan by exercising a portion of the accordion feature under the Revolving Credit Facility (as discussed below). The $600.0 million committed capacity of the unsecured line of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility was not changed as a result of the incurrence of the term loan. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of either one month LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.55% (depending on our credit rating) or the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.55% (based upon our credit rating). The base rate is the highest of the administrative agent's prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and the one month LIBOR market index rate plus 1.0%. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility requires the payment of a facility fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% (depending on our credit rating) on the $600.0 million committed capacity, without regard to usage. As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the facility is one month LIBOR plus 1.00% and the facility fee is 0.20%. We had   $125.0 million   in borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, we executed a   $150.0 million   unsecured term loan   by exercising a portion of the accordion feature under the Revolving Credit Facility. The term loan has a 5.5 year term scheduled to mature on     March 15, 2021     and currently has an interest rate of one month LIBOR plus 110 basis points, based on our current unsecured debt ratings. W  e entered into two interest rate swap arrangements with a total notional amount of $150.0 million to swap the floating interest rate under the term loan to an all-in fixed interest rate of   2.7%   starting on   October 15, 2015   and extending until the maturity of the term loan on March 15, 2021. 
  
   33 

The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial and other covenants with which we must comply. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility or other debt instruments could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments. This could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, our ability to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility or incur other unsecured debt in the future could be restricted by the loan covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with our loan covenants. 
    
  Notes Payable 
    
  We generally issue unsecured notes to fund our real estate assets long term. In issuing future unsecured notes, we intend to ladder the maturities of our debt to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk in future years. 
    
  During the 2016 Quarter, we entered into a $150.0 million unsecured term loan scheduled to mature on July 21, 2023 with a deferred draw period of up to six months. We expect to draw on the term loan in the fourth quarter of 2016 or early in January 2017 to refinance maturing secured debt. We also entered into interest rate derivatives to swap from a LIBOR plus 165 basis points floating rate to a 2.9% all-in fixed interest rate commencing on March 31, 2017. 
    
  Our unsecured notes contain covenants with which we must comply. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under our unsecured notes could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments. This could cause our debt holders to accelerate the timing of payments and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with our unsecured notes covenants. In addition, our ability to draw on our Revolving Credit Facility or incur other unsecured debt in the future could be restricted by our unsecured note covenants. 
    
  From time to time, we may seek to repurchase and cancel our outstanding notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
    
  Common Equity 
    
  We have authorized for issuance   100.0 million   common shares, of which   74.6 million   shares were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On May 4, 2016, we issued approximately 5.3 million common shares, including 693,750 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option, at a price to the public of $28.20 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $143.4 million, which we used initially to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and subsequently to fund our acquisition of Riverside Apartments and for other general corporate purposes.  
    
  On June 23, 2015, we entered into four separate equity distribution agreements (collectively, the  Equity Distribution Agreements ) with each of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and RBC Capital Markets, LLC relating to the issuance of up to $200.0 million of our common shares from time to time. Issuances of our common shares are made at market prices prevailing at the time of issuance. We may use net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under this program for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, working capital, the acquisition, renovation, expansion, improvement, development or redevelopment of income producing properties or the repayment of debt. During the 2016 Quarter and Period, we issued   0.9 million   common shares under the Equity Distribution Agreements at a weighted average price of   $33.32   per share, raising   $29.6 million   in net proceeds. 
    
  We have a dividend reinvestment program, whereby shareholders may use their dividends and optional cash payments to purchase common shares. The common shares sold under this program may either be common shares issued by us or common shares purchased in the open market. During the 2016 Quarter and Period, we issued   17,500   common shares under this program at a weighted average price of   $31.21   per share, raising   $0.5 million   in net proceeds. 
    
  Preferred Equity 
    
  Washington REIT's board of trustees can, at its discretion, authorize the issuance of up to 10.0 million preferred shares. The ability to issue preferred equity provides Washington REIT an additional financing tool that may be used to raise capital for future acquisitions or other business purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , no preferred shares had been issued. 

34 

Dividends 
    
  We currently declare dividends quarterly at a rate of $0.30 per share. The maintenance of our dividend level is subject to various factors reviewed by the board of trustees in its discretion. These factors include our results of operations, the availability of cash and the REIT distribution requirements, which require at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to be distributed to shareholders on an annual basis. When setting the dividend level, our board of trustees looks in particular at trends in our level of funds from operations, together with associated recurring capital improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and incentives, and adjustments to straight-line rents to reflect cash rents received.  
    
  Our dividend and distribution payments for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows (in thousands): 

Dividends paid during the 2016 Quarter increased primarily due to the issuance of   6.2 million   common shares during the 2016 Period. Dividends paid during the   2016   Period increased primarily due to the issuance of common shares and the payment on January 5, 2016 of the $20.4 million of dividends declared during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
    
  Historical Cash Flows 
    
  Cash flows from operations are an important factor in our ability to sustain our dividend at its current rate. If our cash flows from operations were to decline significantly from current levels, we may have to reduce our dividend. Consolidated cash flow information is summarized as follows (in thousands): 

Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to acquisitions and lower interest payments, partially offset by dispositions.  
    
  Cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to the higher volume of disposition activity during the 2016 Period, partially offset by executing a larger acquisition during the 2016 Period. 
    
  Cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to higher debt repayments and dividends paid during the 2016 Period, partially offset proceeds from equity issuances and higher net borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility during the 2016 Period. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Funds From Operations 
    
  NAREIT FFO is a widely used measure of operating performance for real estate companies. We provide NAREIT FFO as a supplemental measure to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Although NAREIT FFO is a widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, NAREIT FFO does not represent net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. As such, it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance. In addition, NAREIT FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our liquidity. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. ( NAREIT ) defines NAREIT FFO (April, 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) associated with  sales of property, impairments of depreciable real estate, and real estate depreciation and amortization. We consider NAREIT FFO to be a standard supplemental measure for REITs because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which historically assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that NAREIT FFO more accurately provides investors an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and fund other needs. Our NAREIT FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs. These other REITs may not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. 
    
  The following table provides the calculation of our NAREIT FFO and a reconciliation of NAREIT FFO to net income for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  We base the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We discuss the most critical estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2016. 
  
   36 

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  The principal material financial market risk to which we are exposed is interest-rate risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to refinancing long-term fixed rate obligations, the opportunity cost of fixed rate obligations in a falling interest rate environment and our variable rate lines of credit.  
    
  The table below presents principal, interest and related weighted average fair value interest rates by year of maturity, with respect to debt outstanding on   September 30, 2016  . 

(1)    Includes $150.0 million term loan with a floating interest rate that is effectively fixed at 2.7% by interest rate swap arrangements. 
   (2)    Excludes net discounts of   $4.3 million   and net unamortized debt issuance costs of   $0.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On   September 15, 2015  , we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements with a total notional amount of   $150.0 million   to swap the floating interest rate under our new   $150.0 million   term loan to an all-in fixed interest rate of   2.7%   starting on   October 15, 2015   and extending until the maturity of the term loan on   March 15, 2021  . On   July 22, 2016  , we entered into   two   forward interest rate swap arrangements with a total notional amount of   $150.0 million   to swap the floating interest rate under the 2016 Term Loan (see note   6  ) to an all-in fixed interest rate of   2.9%  , starting on   March 31, 2017   and extending until the maturity of the 2016 Term Loan on   July 21, 2023  (see note   7   to the consolidated financial statements).   
    
  We entered into the interest rate swap arrangements designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges to reduce our exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivative instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparty under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreement. We believe that we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major, creditworthy financial institutions. As part of our ongoing control procedures, we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity, thus minimizing our credit risk concentration. The following table sets forth information pertaining to interest rate swap contracts in place as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and their respective fair values (dollars in thousands): 

37 

We enter into debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes including acquisition of real estate properties, capital improvements and working capital needs. 
    
  As the majority of our outstanding debt is long-term, fixed rate debt, our interest rate risk has not changed significantly from what was disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2016. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Debt Financing.  

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
    
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer and Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  There have been no changes in Washington REIT s internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the period covered by the report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Washington REIT s internal control over financial reporting.

During any period that the Borrower has (a) not received a Credit Rating from any Rating Agency or (b) received a Credit Rating from only one Rating Agency that is neither S P or Moody s, then the Applicable Margins shall be determined based on Level 5.

(b)      Requests for Loans  .  Not later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern time at least 1 Business Day prior to a borrowing of Loans that are to be Base Rate Loans and not later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern time at least 3 Business Days prior to a borrowing of Loans that are to be LIBOR Loans, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Borrowing.  Each Notice of Borrowing shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, the date such Loans are to be borrowed (which must be a Business Day), the Type of the Loans, the initial Interest Period for such Loans (if such Loans are to be LIBOR Loans) and the amount of such LIBOR Loans, if any, that the Borrower has elected to have subject to a Specified Derivatives Contract that provides a hedge against interest rate risks and the Specified Derivative Contracts to which such amount is subject.  Such notice shall be irrevocable once given and binding on the Borrower.  No more than 3 Notices of Borrowings may be submitted on behalf of the Borrower prior to the Availability Termination Date.

Each such Lender shall deposit an amount equal to the Loan to be made by such Lender to the Borrower with the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office, in immediately available funds, not later than 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date of such proposed Loans.  Subject to fulfillment of all applicable conditions set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall make available to the Borrower in the account specified by the Borrower in writing to the Administrative Agent, not later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date of the requested borrowing of Loans, the proceeds of such amounts received by the Administrative Agent.

With respect to Loans to be made after the Effective Date, unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent a Loan to be made by such Lender in connection with any borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender will make the proceeds of such Loan available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Section, and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower the amount of such Loan to be provided by such Lender.  In such event, if such Lender does not make available to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of such Loan, then such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent on demand the amount of such Loan with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such Loan is made available to the Borrower but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay the amount of such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays to the Administrative Agent the amount of such Loan, the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make available the proceeds of a Loan to be made by such Lender.

To such end, all the Lenders of such Class shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender of a Class so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in the Loans or other Obligations owed to the other Lenders of such Class may exercise all rights of set-off, banker s lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans of such Class in the amount of such participation so long as such Participant has agreed to be subject to this Section.

Each Defaulting Lender hereby grants to the Administrative Agent a limited power of attorney to execute any such Assignment and Assumption on behalf of such Defaulting Lender shall it fail to do so as required by this subsection.  The Borrower confirms that is obligations under Section 12.9. apply to any and all actions taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent under this subsection.

   - 40 - 
             Execution Version 

such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower or other applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided that the determinations in such statement are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith. 
    
  (e)      Indemnification by the Lenders  .

Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this subsection.  The provisions of this subsection shall continue to inure to the benefit of an Administrative Agent following its resignation or removal as Administrative Agent.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in the immediately following clauses (ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D)) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
    
  (ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person: 
    
  (A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), an electronic copy (or an original if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of an executed IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;

requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable,; or 
    
  (IV)    to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, an electronic copy (or an original if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of an executed IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
    
  (C)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), an electronic copy (or an original if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
    
  (D)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D),  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
    
  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
    
  (h)      Treatment of Certain Refunds  .  If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant  
  
   - 43 -

Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
    
  (i)      Survival  .  Each party s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
    
  ARTICLE IV. YIELD PROTECTION, ETC. 
  Section 4.1.  Additional Costs; Capital Adequacy. 
  (a)      Capital Adequacy  .  If any Lender determines that any Regulatory Change affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, any Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as shall compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
    
  (b)      Additional Costs.    In addition to, and not in limitation of the immediately preceding subsection (a), the Borrower shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of a Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs incurred by such Lender that it reasonably determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any LIBOR Loans or its obligation to make any LIBOR Loans hereunder, any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such LIBOR Loans or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital in respect of its LIBOR Loans or its Commitments (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called  Additional Costs ), resulting from any Regulatory Change that: 
    
  (i)    changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such LIBOR Loans or its Commitments (other than Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and Connection Income Taxes); 
  
   - 44 - 
             Execution Version 

(ii)    imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirements (other than Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or other similar reserve requirement applicable to any other category of liabilities or category of extensions of credit or other assets by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined to the extent utilized when determining LIBOR for such Loans) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by such Lender (or its parent corporation), or any commitment of such Lender (including, without limitation, the Commitments of such Lender hereunder); or 
    
  (iii)    imposes on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender. 
    
  (c)      Lender s Suspension of LIBOR Loans.    Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the immediately preceding subsections (a) and (b), if by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender that includes LIBOR Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 4.5. shall apply). 
    
  (d)      Notification and Determination of Additional Costs  .  Each of the Administrative Agent, and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to notify the Borrower (and in the case of a Lender, to notify the Administrative Agent) of any event occurring after the Agreement Date entitling the Administrative Agent or such Lender to compensation under any of the preceding subsections of this Section as promptly as practicable; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give such notice shall not release the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).  The Administrative Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to furnish to the Borrower (and in the case of a Lender to the Administrative Agent as well) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and amount of each request for compensation under this Section.  Determinations by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of the effect of any Regulatory Change shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent and or any such Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith; provided, however, that a Lender shall not be entitled to submit a claim for compensation based upon a Regulatory Change pursuant to any subsection of this Section 4.1. unless the making of such claim is consistent with such Lender s general practices under similar circumstances in respect of similarly situated borrowers with credit agreements entitling it to make such claims (it being agreed that a Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information in connection with such determination or the making of such claim).

  (a)    the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining LIBOR for such Interest Period; 
    
  (b)    the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the definition of LIBOR are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest for LIBOR Loans as provided herein; or 
    
  (c)    the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition of LIBOR upon the basis of which the rate of interest for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined are not likely to adequately cover the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period;  
       
  then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower and each Lender prompt notice thereof and, so long as such condition remains in effect the Lenders shall be under no obligation to, and shall not, make additional LIBOR Loans, Continue LIBOR Loans or Convert Loans into LIBOR Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day of each current Interest Period for each outstanding LIBOR Loan, either prepay such Loan or Convert such Loan into a Base Rate Loan. 
    
  Section 4.3.  Illegality. 
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding) that it is unlawful for such Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) and such Lender s obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other Type into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 4.5. shall be applicable). 
    
  Section 4.4.  Compensation. 
  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as the Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender for any loss, cost or expense attributable to: 
    
  (a)    any payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) of a LIBOR Loan or Conversion of a LIBOR Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or 
    
  (b)    any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions precedent specified in Section 5.2. to be satisfied) to borrow a LIBOR Loan from such Lender on the date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan or Continue a LIBOR Loan on the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.

             Execution Version 

Not in limitation of the foregoing, such compensation shall include, without limitation, an amount equal to the then present value of (A) the amount of interest that would have accrued on such LIBOR Loan for the remainder of the Interest Period at the rate applicable to such LIBOR Loan, less (B) the amount of interest that would accrue on the same LIBOR Loan for the same period if LIBOR were set on the date on which such LIBOR Loan was repaid, prepaid or Converted or the date on which the Borrower failed to borrow, Convert or Continue such LIBOR Loan, as applicable, calculating present value by using as a discount rate LIBOR quoted on such date; provided that in no event shall such compensation include any loss of anticipated profits.  Upon the Borrower s request, the Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower with a statement setting forth the basis for requesting compensation under this Section and the method for determining the amount thereof.  Any such statement shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
    
  Section 4.5.  Treatment of Affected Loans. 
  If the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.1.(c), Section 4.2. or Section 4.3. then such Lender s LIBOR Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for LIBOR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by Section 4.1.(c), Section 4.2., or Section 4.3. on such earlier date as such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, may specify to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, as applicable)) and, unless and until such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 4.1., Section 4.2. or Section 4.3. that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist: 
    
  (i)    to the extent that such Lender s LIBOR Loans have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender s LIBOR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and 
    
  (ii)    all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as LIBOR Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans. 
    
  If such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, as applicable) that the circumstances specified in Section 4.1.(c), 4.2. or 4.3. that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lender s LIBOR Loans pursuant to this Section no longer exist (which such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when LIBOR Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, then such Lender s Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding LIBOR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans of the applicable Class held by the Lenders holding LIBOR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments. 
    
  Section 4.6.  Affected Lenders. 
  If (a) a Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.10. or 4.1., and the Requisite Lenders are not also doing the same, or (b) the obligation of any Lender to make LIBOR Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.1.(c) or 4.3. but the obligation of the Requisite Lenders shall not have been suspended under such Sections, the Borrower may demand that such Lender (the  Affected Lender ), and upon such demand the Affected Lender shall promptly, assign its Commitment to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.5.(b) for a purchase price equal to (x) the aggregate principal balance of all Loans then owing to the Affected Lender, plus (y) any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing

The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall be at the Borrower s sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Administrative Agent, the Affected Lender or any of the other Lenders.  The terms of this Section shall not in any way limit the Borrower s obligation to pay to any Affected Lender compensation owing to such Affected Lender pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 3.10., 4.1. or 4.4.) with respect to any period up to the date of replacement.

  Section 4.8.  Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Loans. 
  Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Article shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded LIBOR Loans through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate applicable to such LIBOR Loans in an amount equal to the amount of the LIBOR Loans and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its LIBOR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for calculation of amounts payable under this Article.

The Borrower shall not permit the ratio of (i) Consolidated Total Indebtedness to (ii) Consolidated Total Asset Value to exceed 0.60 to 1.00 at any time;   provided  ,   however  , that if such ratio is greater than 0.60 to 1.00 but is not greater than 0.65 to 1.00, then the Borrower shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subsection (a) so long as (i) the Borrower completed a Material Acquisition which resulted in such ratio (after giving effect to such Material Acquisition) exceeding 0.60 to 1.00 at any time during the fiscal quarter in which such Material Acquisition took place and for any subsequent consecutive fiscal quarters, (ii) the Borrower has not maintained compliance with this subsection (a) in reliance on this proviso for more than four fiscal quarters (whether or not consecutive) and (iii) such ratio (after giving effect to such Material Acquisition) is not greater than 0.65 to 1.00 at any time.

  (e)      Ratio of Consolidated Unsecured Indebtedness to Unencumbered Pool Value.    The Borrower shall not permit the ratio of (i) Consolidated Unsecured Indebtedness to (ii) Unencumbered Pool Value to exceed 0.60 to 1.00 at any time;   provided  ,   however  , that if such ratio is greater than 0.60 to 1.00 but is not greater than 0.65 to 1.00, then the Borrower shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subsection (e) so long as (i) the Borrower completed a Material Acquisition which resulted in such ratio (after giving effect to such Material Acquisition) exceeding 0.60 to 1.00 at any time during the fiscal quarter in which such Material Acquisition took place and for any subsequent consecutive fiscal quarters, (ii) the Borrower has not maintained compliance with this subsection (e) in reliance on this proviso for more than four fiscal quarters (whether or not consecutive) and (iii) such ratio (after giving effect to such Material Acquisition)

  ARTICLE XI. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 
  Section 11.1.  Appointment and Authorization. 
  Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as contractual representative on such Lender s behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Not in limitation of the foregoing, each Lender authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into the Loan Documents for the benefit of the Lenders.  Each Lender hereby agrees that, except as otherwise set forth herein, any action taken by the Requisite Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Requisite Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders.  Nothing herein shall be construed to deem the Administrative Agent a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender or to impose on the Administrative Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided for herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the terms  Agent ,  Administrative Agent ,  agent  and similar terms in the Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law.  Instead, use of such terms is merely a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.  The Administrative Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender, promptly upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent, copies of each of the financial statements, certificates, notices and other documents delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article VIII. that the Borrower is not otherwise required to deliver directly to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will furnish to any Lender, upon the request of such Lender, a copy (or, where appropriate, an original) of any document, instrument, agreement, certificate or notice furnished to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate of the Borrower, pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document not already delivered or otherwise made available to such Lender pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any such other Loan Document.  As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of any of the Obligations), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected  
  
   - 76 - 
             Execution Version 

in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders if explicitly required under any other provision of this Agreement), and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of any of the Obligations; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or Applicable Law.  Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may exercise any right or remedy it or the Lenders may have under any Loan Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default unless the Requisite Lenders have directed the Administrative Agent otherwise.  Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Requisite Lenders, or where applicable, all the Lenders. 
    
  Section 11.2.  Administrative Agent as Lender. 
  The Lender acting as Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers as a Lender or a Specified Derivatives Provider, as the case may be, under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Specified Derivatives Contract, as the case may be, as any other Lender or any Specified Derivatives Provider and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term  Lender  or  Lenders  shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include the Lender acting as Administrative Agent in each case in its individual capacity.  Such Lender and its Affiliates may each accept deposits from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and without any duty to account therefor to other Lenders or any Specified Derivatives Providers.  Further, the Administrative Agent and any Affiliate may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement or any Specified Derivatives Contract, or otherwise without having to account for the same to the other Lenders or any Specified Derivatives Providers.  The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Lender acting as Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower, other Loan Parties, other Subsidiaries and other Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Person) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. 
    
  Section 11.3.  Approvals of Lenders. 
  All communications from the Administrative Agent to any Lender requesting such Lender s determination, consent or approval (a) shall be given in the form of a written notice to such Lender, (b) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter or issue as to which such determination, consent or approval is requested, or shall advise such Lender where information, if any, regarding such matter or issue may be inspected, or shall otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved and (c) shall include, if reasonably requested by such Lender and to the extent not previously provided to such Lender, written materials provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved.  Unless a Lender shall give written notice to the Administrative Agent that it specifically objects to the requested determination, consent or approval within 10 Business Days (or such lesser or greater period as may be specifically required under the express terms of the Loan Documents) of receipt of such communication, such Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively approved or consented to such requested determination, consent or approval.  The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any amendment, waiver or consent regarding any of the matters described in Section 12.6.(b).

Section 11.4.  Notice of Events of Default. 
  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing with reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a  notice of default.   If any Lender (excluding the Lender which is also serving as the Administrative Agent) becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default, it shall promptly send to the Administrative Agent such a  notice of default  provided, a Lender s failure to provide such a  notice of default  to the Administrative Agent shall not result in any liability of such Lender to any other party to any of the Loan Documents.  Further, if the Administrative Agent receives such a  notice of default,  the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. 
    
  Section 11.5.  Administrative Agent s Reliance. 
  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except for its or their own bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein or therein as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties: (a) makes any warranty or representation to any Lender or any other Person, or shall be responsible to any Lender or any other Person for any statement, warranty or representation made or deemed made by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (b) shall have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent under this Agreement or any Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or other Persons, or to inspect the property, books or records of the Borrower or any other Person; (c) shall be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or any collateral covered thereby or the perfection or priority of any Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders Parties in any such collateral; (d) shall have any liability in respect of any recitals, statements, certifications, representations or warranties contained in any of the Loan Documents or any other document, instrument, agreement, certificate or statement delivered in connection therewith; and (e) shall incur any liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail) believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or given by the proper party or parties.  The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such agent or attorney-in-fact as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment. 
    
  Section 11.6.  Indemnification of Administrative Agent. 
  Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) pro rata in accordance with such Lender s respective Commitment Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed  
  
   - 78 - 
             Execution Version 

expense or indemnity payment is sought), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent but not as a Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively,  Indemnifiable Amounts  provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent resulting from the Administrative Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment; provided, further, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders, if expressly required hereunder) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) promptly upon demand for its Commitment Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable reimbursement is sought) of any out of pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the counsel to the Administrative Agent) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of, or legal advice with respect to the rights or responsibilities of the parties under, the Loan Documents, any suit or action brought by the Administrative Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents and/or collect any Obligations, any  lender liability  suit or claim brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, and any claim or suit brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws.  Such out of pocket expenses (including counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the Administrative Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Administrative Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Administrative Agent is not so entitled to indemnification.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  If the Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the Administrative Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment. 
    
  Section 11.7.  Lender Credit Decision, Etc. 
  Each of the Lenders expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties has made any representations or warranties to such Lender and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary or Affiliate, shall be deemed to constitute any such representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender.  Each of the Lenders acknowledges that it has made its own credit and legal analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Administrative Agent, or any of their respective Related Parties, and based on the financial statements of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the other Subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and inquiries of such Persons, its independent due diligence of the business and affairs of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the other Subsidiaries and other Persons, its review of the Loan Documents, the legal opinions required to be delivered to it hereunder, the advice of its own counsel and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate.

Each of the Lenders acknowledges that the Administrative Agent s legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is only acting as counsel to the Administrative Agent and is not acting as counsel to any Lender.

  The Administrative Agent (a) may resign at any time as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower or (b) may be removed as Administrative Agent by the Requisite Lenders (excluding the Lender then acting as Administrative Agent) if the Administrative Agent (i) is found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to have committed gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in the course of performing its duties hereunder or (ii) has become a Defaulting Lender under clause (d) of the definition of such term.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which appointment shall, provided no Event of Default exists, be subject to the Borrower s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the current Administrative Agent s giving of notice of resignation or upon the removal of the current Administrative Agent, then, in the case of resignation by the Administrative Agent, the current Administrative Agent may, or in the case of removal of the Administrative Agent, the Requisite Lenders may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be an Eligible Assignee; provided that if no Lender has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made to each Lender directly, until such time as a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed as provided for above in this Section; provided, further that such Lenders so acting directly shall be and be deemed to be protected by all indemnities and other provisions herein for the benefit and protection of the Administrative Agent as if each such Lender were itself the Administrative Agent.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the current Administrative Agent, and the current Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent may assign its rights and duties under the Loan Documents to any of its Affiliates by giving the Borrower and each Lender prior written notice.

The titles given to the Titled Agents are solely honorific and imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party and the use of such titles does not impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other than those to which any other Lender is entitled.

If the Borrower shall fail to pay any amounts required to be paid by it pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders may pay such amounts on behalf of the Borrower and such amounts shall be deemed to be Obligations owing hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation to reimburse the Lender Parties for fees and expenses in connection with the matters described in items (b) and (d) shall be limited to the reasonable and documented out of pocket fees, disbursements and other charges of one counsel to the Lender Parties and, if reasonably necessary, a single local counsel for the Lender Parties in each relevant jurisdiction and with respect to each relevant specialty, and in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, one additional counsel in each relevant jurisdiction to the affected Lender Parties similarly situated.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, if any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.9. and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (y) such Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.

EACH PARTY FURTHER WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM AND EACH AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM THE SAME.

  (c)    THE BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT, OR OTHER PROCESS OR PAPERS ISSUED THEREIN, AND AGREES THAT SERVICE OF SUCH SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT, OR OTHER PROCESS OR PAPERS MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL ADDRESSED TO THE BORROWER AT ITS ADDRESS FOR NOTICES PROVIDED IN SECTION 12.1.

(d)    THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY EACH PARTY WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THEREOF, AND SHALL SURVIVE THE PAYMENT OF THE LOANS AND ALL OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE HEREUNDER OR UNDER THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
    
  Section 12.5.  Successors and Assigns. 
  (a)      Successors and Assigns Generally  .  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower (other than as permitted pursuant to Section 12.20.) may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of the immediately following subsection (b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of the immediately following subsection (d) or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of the immediately following subsection (e) (and, subject to the last sentence of the immediately following subsection (b), any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in the immediately following subsection (d) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
    
  (b)      Assignments by Lenders  .  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it);   provided   that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:  
    
  (i)      Minimum Amounts  .   
    
  (A)    in the case of (w) an assignment of the entire remaining amount of an  assigning Lender s Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it, (x) contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the amount specified in the immediately following clause (B) in the aggregate, (y) an assignment of the entire remaining amount of an assigning Lender s Commitment or Loans of a Class at the time owing to it, or (z) an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and 
    
  (B)    in any case not described in the immediately preceding subsection (A), the aggregate amount of the Commitment of a Class (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Class of Commitments is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of the applicable Class of Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (in each case, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if  Trade Date  is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000 in the case of any assignment of a Commitment or Loan, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that if, after giving effect to such assignment, the amount  
  
   - 85 - 
             Execution Version 

of the Commitment of the applicable Class held by such assigning Lender or the outstanding principal balance of the Loans of the applicable Class of such assigning Lender, as applicable, would be less than $5,000,000, then such assigning Lender shall assign the entire amount of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it.  
    
  (ii)      Proportionate Amounts  .  Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations with respect to separate Classes of Loans and Commitments on a non-rata basis. 
    
  (iii)      Required Consents  .  No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by clause (i)(B) of this subsection (b) and, in addition: 
    
  (A)    the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default shall exist at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 5 Business Days after having received notice thereof; and 
    
  (B)    the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (x) a Commitment of a Class if such assignment is to a Person that is not already a Lender with a Commitment of such Class, an Affiliate of such a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such a Lender or (y) a Loan to a Person who is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund. 
    
  (iv)      Assignment and Assumption; Notes  .  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $4,500 for each assignment (which fee the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive), and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.  If requested by the transferor Lender or the assignee, upon the consummation of any assignment, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes are issued to the assignee and such transferor Lender, as appropriate, and such transferor Lender shall promptly return any existing Notes held by such Lender to the Borrower (or, if lost, destroyed or mutilated, if requested by the Borrower a lost note affidavit including a customary indemnity). 
    
  (v)      No Assignment to Certain Persons  .  No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrower s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or to any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B).

             Execution Version 

(vii)      Certain Additional Payments  .  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its Commitment Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. 
    
  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the immediately following subsection (c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.4., 12.2. and 12.9. and the other provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as provided in Section 12.10. with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with the immediately following subsection (d). 
    
  (c)      Register  .  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Principal Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the  Register ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
    
  (d)      Participations  .  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than any Person to whom an assignment would be prohibited under Section 12.5.(b)(v) or (vi)) (each, a  Participant ) in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it);   provided   that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance  
  
   - 87 - 
             Execution Version 

of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any  provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (w) increase such Lender s Commitment, (x) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal on the Loans or portions thereof owing to such Lender, (y) reduce the rate at which interest is payable thereon or (z) release any Guarantor from its Obligations under the Guaranty except as contemplated by Section 7.13.(c), in each case, as applicable to that portion of such Lender s rights and/or obligations that are subject to the participation.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.10., 4.1., 4.4.     (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.10.(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.10.(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section;   provided   that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 4.6. as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 4.1.     or 3.10., with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Regulatory Change that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 4.6. with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.3. as though it were a Lender;   provided   that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.3. as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the  Participant Register    provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
    
  (e)      Certain Pledges  .  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.   
    
  (f)      No Registration  .  Each Lender agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, it will not make any assignment hereunder in any manner or under any circumstances that would require registration or qualification of, or filings in respect of, any Loan or Note under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of the United States of America or of any other jurisdiction.

             Execution Version 

(g)      USA Patriot Act Notice; Compliance  .  In order for the Administrative Agent to comply with  know your customer  and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation, the Patriot Act, prior to any Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America becoming a party hereto, the Administrative Agent may request, and such Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other identification information as shall be necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with federal law.

Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

  WHEREAS, Executive has voluntarily decided to resign from his position; and 
    
  WHEREAS, the parties desire to resolve amicable all matters between them on a full and final basis; 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 
    
  1.    Resignation and Return of Property  :  Executive hereby confirms his previously submitted resignation from Company effective as of July 26, 2016 (the  Resignation Date ) and hereby resigns from all employment, officer and/or director positions he holds with Company and any of its subsidiaries and other affiliated entities (collectively  Affiliates )  effective as of  the Resignation Date.  Executive will execute all documents requested by Company to effectuate such resignation(s).  Executive acknowledges and agrees that his resignation was voluntary and will not be considered a resignation for Good Reason for any purposes.    On or before the Resignation Date, Executive will return all property of Company and its Affiliates, and all copies, excerpts or summaries of such property, in his possession, custody or control.  Between the date he receives this Agreement and the Resignation Date, Executive will transition his duties on an orderly basis and perform  duties assigned to him at historical levels of performance, and he will refrain from any conduct that is disloyal to Company or that is damaging to or disruptive of Company s finances, reputation, operations or relationships. 
    
  2.    Final Paycheck and Separation Payment  : Regardless of whether or not Executive signs this Agreement, Company will pay Executive for all earned but unpaid salary and vacation as of the Resignation Date in accordance with its payroll practices and applicable law.  In addition, in exchange for Executive s compliance with, and his fulfillment of his obligations  under this Agreement, Company will pay to Executive   $200,000,  less required withholdings and deductions (the  Separation Payment ).  If it is due and owing, the Separation Payment will be  paid in the first quarter of 2017, but no later than March 15, 2017.  
    
  3.    Benefits  :    Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, Executive's entitlement to, participation in, and accrual of, all other salary, compensation or benefits from Company shall cease as of the Resignation Date, except that Executive shall have such rights in such benefits as are required by law and plan documents, including without limitation,

  4.    References  : Executive will direct all requests for employment references from Company to either Company s President    CEO or its Vice President of Human Resources.     
    
  5.    Mutual Releases  : 
    
  A.    Executive s Release  :  In consideration for the benefits described herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, which are of greater value than Executive would normally be entitled upon Resignation, Executive, on behalf of himself, his heirs, executors, administrators, attorneys, agents, representatives and assigns, hereby forever releases Company and its Affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, trustees, owners, shareholders, employees, insurers, benefit plans, agents, attorneys and representatives, and each of their predecessors, successors and assigns, from any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, losses, expenses, charges or causes of action of any nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, relating in any way to any act, omission, event, relationship, conduct, policy or practice prior to the Effective Date, including without limitation his employment with Company and the termination thereof  ( Claims ). This release includes without limitation Claims for discrimination, harassment, retaliation or any other violation under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the District of Columbia Human Rights Act, , and any other Claims under all other federal, state or local laws; Claims for breach of contract; Claims for wrongful discharge; Claims for emotional distress, defamation, fraud, misrepresentation or any other personal injury; Claims for unpaid compensation; Claims relating to benefits; Claims for attorneys' fees and costs, Claims for reinstatement or employment; and all other Claims under any federal, state or local law or cause of action.

It is understood and agreed that this Release does not apply to claims for breach of this Agreement, Claims for any vested benefits or Claims that cannot be released by law.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Company shall not be released from any obligations it may have under the Indemnification Agreement between Company and Executive dated July 23, 2009 (the  Indemnification Agreement ), which shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to its terms. 
    
  B.    Company s Release  :  In consideration for the benefits described herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, Company and its Affiliates hereby forever release  Executive,  his  heirs, executors, administrators, agents, representatives and assigns, from any and all Claims.

   2 

breach of this Agreement, Claims that cannot be released by law, or Claims for fraud, embezzlement, intentional misconduct or any other malfeasance. 
    
  6.    Reinstatement  :  Executive waives all claims for reinstatement or employment with Company and its Affiliates, and its and their successors and assigns, and he agrees not to seek such reinstatement or employment in the future unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. 
    
  7.    Confidentiality  :    Except as necessary to enforce or effectuate this Agreement or as required by law or otherwise to satisfy SEC filing or disclosure requirements (it being understood that Company intends to file this Agreement or a summary of this Agreement with the SEC), or to the extent Company in good faith deems necessary in communications with analysts and institutional investors of real estate investment trusts, the parties agree to in good faith endeavor to keep this Agreement, the existence of this Agreement, and the terms of this Agreement confidential and not to initiate any disclosures of it.  Subject to the foregoing, Executive shall not initiate any disclosure of the same to any third party except as necessary to his attorneys, accountants, future employer and immediate family members (and only on the condition that they maintain such confidentiality and Executive guarantees such confidentiality).  Also subject to the foregoing, Company shall not initiate any disclosure of the same to any third party except its board of directors, officers, attorneys, accountants and employees responsible for effectuating the Agreement (and only on the condition that they maintain such confidentiality and Company guarantees such confidentiality).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either party is asked about the reasons for Executive s resignation, they may state in substance that Executive resigned to accept another position or words substantially to that effect.  
    
  8.    Nondisparagement and Nonassistance  :  Executive agrees not to provide any disparaging information relating to Company or any of its Affiliates or its or their past, present or future management, officers, trustees or Executives to any person or entity who is not a party to this Agreement, and he agrees to the extent permitted by law not to provide any form of assistance to, or to cooperate with, any person or entity asserting or intending to assert any claim or legal proceeding against Company or any of its Affiliates except as may be required by law or legal process.  Nothing herein prohibits Executive from reporting alleged violations to the SEC or other government agencies, although Executive is not aware of any alleged violations.   Company shall instruct its Human Resources Department and its Officers not to provide any disparaging information relating to Executive to any person or entity who is not a party to this Agreement, and it agrees to the extent permitted by law not to provide any form of assistance to, or to cooperate with, any person or entity asserting or intending to assert any claim or legal proceeding against Executive, except as may be required by law or legal process. 
    
  9.    Cooperation  : Executive agrees to reasonably cooperate with Company upon request by answering questions and providing information about matters of which he has personal knowledge, including without limitation any litigations, investigations or other legal proceedings.  In the event that Company becomes involved in any civil or criminal litigation, administrative proceeding or governmental investigation, Executive shall, upon request, provide reasonable cooperation and assistance to Company, including without limitation, furnishing relevant information, attending meetings and providing statements and testimony.  Company will  
  
   3 

reimburse Executive for all reasonable and necessary expenses he incurs in complying with this Section 9, provided said expenses are reasonable and necessary and approved by Company in advance.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Executive s obligations under this Section 9 shall not (other than on an immaterial basis) interfere with Executive s full-time employment with another Company and shall not require Executive to engage in the practice of law. 

10.    Nondisclosure and Nonsolicitation  : Executive shall not, except as required by law, use or disclose to any person or entity any Confidential Information.  For the purposes of this Section 10,  Confidential Information  means information Executive obtained through or as a consequence of his employment with Company relating to Company s business or its tenants which is not in the public domain and includes, without limitation, trade secrets, tenant lists, lease rates, methods of operation,  business plans, leads, financial information, research and statistical data.  Information does not lose its protection as Confidential Information if it is disclosed in violation of an obligation not to disclose it.  During the period prior to the Resignation Date and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Executive shall not directly or indirectly for himself or any other person or entity, whether as an employee, officer, director, consultant, agent, representative, partner, owner, stockholder or in any other capacity, a) solicit any person who then is or was at any time in the preceding six month period employed by Company as an employee or independent contractor,  to resign from Company or to accept employment as an employee or independent contractor with any other person or entity; or b) solicit any person or entity who then is or was at any time in the preceding six month period in a business relationship with Company to end or curtail such relationship or to engage in business of the type engaged in by Company with another person or entity.  Executive agrees that these restrictions are reasonable and necessary for the protection of  Company s business.  Executive further agrees that in the event he breaches any provision in this Section 10, Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to such other relief as a court may deem proper. 
    
  11.    Miscellaneous  : This Agreement represents the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes all other agreements, discussions and understandings of the parties, concerning the subject matter.  All other express or implied agreements of the parties not expressly contained or incorporated by reference herein are terminated and of no further force or effect (it being understood that the Indemnification Agreement shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to its terms).  This Agreement may not be modified in any manner except in a written document signed by both parties.  Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be deemed severed from the Agreement, and the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, provided that, should the court determine that any provision of Section 10 is unenforceable, the court shall modify such provision to make it valid to the maximum extent permitted by law.  In the event of any litigation to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be awarded his or its reasonable attorneys  fees and costs. 
    
  12.       Consultation and Consideration  : Company hereby advises Executive to consult with an attorney at his own expense prior to signing this Agreement.  Executive may take up to twenty-one (21) days from the date he is given this Agreement to consider it, but he may sign it  
  
   4 

sooner if he wishes.  If he signs the Agreement, he will have a period of seven (7) days to revoke his signature (the "Revocation Period").  Thus, this Agreement will not become effective or enforceable until the date that each party has signed the Agreement and the Revocation Period has expired without Executive exercising his right of revocation (the "Effective Date").  Any notice of revocation must be in writing and must be received by Brian Guttman, Vice President of Human Resources, prior to the expiration of the Revocation Period.   If Executive signs this Agreement, he represents that he has had sufficient time to consider it, and that she enters into it knowingly and voluntarily with full understanding of its meaning and effect.   
    
  13.    Governing Law  :    This Agreement shall be construed exclusively in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws therein. 
    
  14.    Assignment  : This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.  Executive may not assign any right or obligation hereunder without Company s prior written consent.  Company may assign its rights and obligations here under to any successor in interest. 
    
  15.   Section 409A of the Code  . To the extent that such requirements are applicable, this Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (   Section 409A   ) and shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with that intent.  If any provision of the Agreement would otherwise conflict with or frustrate this intent, that provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid the conflict.  Further, for purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, each payment of compensation under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment of compensation for purposes of applying the deferral election rules under Section 409A and the exclusion from Section 409A for certain short-term deferral amounts.  Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, in the event that any such benefit or payment is deemed to not comply with Section 409A, Company and Executive agree to renegotiate in good faith any such benefit or payment so that either (i) Section 409A will not apply or (ii) compliance with Section 409A will be achieved,   provided  ,   however  , that any resulting renegotiated terms shall provide to Executive, to the extent reasonably practicable, the after-tax economic equivalent based on what otherwise would have been provided to Executive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.   
    
  16.    Counterparts  : This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and together which shall constitute one and the same instrument.  A signature transmitted by email shall be considered an original signature. 

THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 

5 

17.    Nonadmissions  :  By entering into this Agreement, neither party is admitting that it did anything wrong or improper or that it has any liability to the other party. 
    
  Executive has had an opportunity to carefully review and consider this Agreement with an attorney, and he has had sufficient time to consider it.  After such careful  
  consideration, he knowingly and voluntarily enters into this Agreement with full understanding of its meaning and effect. 
    
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement.

Exhibit 31.1  
  CERTIFICATION  
  I, Paul T. McDermott, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Washington Real Estate Investment Trust; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a.
