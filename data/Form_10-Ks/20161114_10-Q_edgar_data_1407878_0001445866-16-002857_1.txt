Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016

(Unaudited)

1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of Carbon Sciences, Inc. (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

In January 2015, we formed Transphene, Inc. ("Transphene") to hold 50% ownership in the technology developed through a research agreement (Note 9).  Through September 30, 2016, the Company has not licensed any intellectual property from UCSB and therefore has not assigned any intellectual property to Transphene.  There have been no financial transactions in Transphene and no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  All future inter-company transactions will be eliminated in consolidation.

Going Concern 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company does not generate any revenue, and has negative cash flows from operations, which raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital.   Since its inception through September 30, 2016, the Company has obtained funds primarily from the issuance of common stock and debt.  Management believes this funding will continue, and is continually seeking new investors.  Management believes the existing shareholders and lenders and prospective new investors will provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company's obligations as they become due, and will allow the development of its core of business.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The significant accounting policies of the Company are disclosed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The following summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company's interim financial statements.  The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company's management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.  These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.

Income (Loss) per Share Calculations 

Basic net income or loss per common share (Basic EPS) is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted net income or loss per common share (Diluted EPS) is computed by dividing net income or loss by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the dilutive potential common share equivalents then outstanding.  Potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants to acquire common stock using the treasury stock method and the average market price per share during the period, and shares issuable upon exercise of convertible notes payable.

6 

INDEX  

Since we had no dilutive effect of stock options and warrants for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding is the same as our diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  The Company has excluded 1,410,000 common shares for exercisable options, 46,000 common shares for exercisable common stock purchase warrants, approximately 114,041,000 common shares issuable upon exercise of convertible notes payable and approximately 359,000,000 common shares upon exercise of convertible Series B preferred stock for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The Company has excluded 1,410,000 common shares for exercisable options, 46,000 common shares for exercisable common stock purchase warrants and approximately 347,453,000 common shares issuable upon exercise of convertible notes payable for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that value.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts reported for cash, accrued interest and other expenses, and notes payable approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.

We adopted ASC Topic 820 (originally issued as SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements") as of January 1, 2008 for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;

Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.

We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

INDEX  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had the following activity in its derivative liabilities:

Derivative Liabilities 

We have identified the conversion features of our convertible notes payable and our Series B preferred stock as derivatives.  We estimate the fair value of the derivatives associated with our convertible notes payable using the Black-Scholes pricing model and estimate the fair value of the derivatives associated with our Series B preferred stock using a multinomial lattice model based on projections of various potential future outcomes.  We estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities at the inception of the financial instruments, at the date of conversions to equity and at each reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount, additional paid-in capital and a gain or loss on change in derivative liabilities as applicable.  These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain outcomes based on management projections.  These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period and to management's judgment; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Management reviewed new accounting pronouncements issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and through the date of filing this report, and believes no pronouncements are applicable to or would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

INDEX  

Reclassifications 

Certain amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

3.  CAPITAL STOCK

At September 30, 2016, the Company's authorized stock consisted of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share.  The Company is also authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share.  The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the preferred stock will be determined by the Board of Directors prior to issuance of such shares.

Series A Preferred Stock 

On February 12, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the issuance of 1,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at par value of $0.001 per share to the Company's President and director, William E. Beifuss, Jr., for services rendered.

On February 12, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation for its Series A Preferred Stock the "Series A Certificate") with the Secretary of State of Nevada designating 1,000 shares of its authorized preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock.  The shares of Series A Preferred Stock have a par value of $0.001 per share. The Series A Preferred Shares do not have a dividend rate or liquidation preference and are not convertible into shares of common stock.

For so long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock remain issued and outstanding, the holders thereof, voting separately as a class, shall have the right, on or after February 12, 2016, to vote in an amount equal to 51% of the total vote (representing a super majority voting power) with respect to any proposal relating to (a) increasing the authorized share capital of the Company, and (b) effecting any reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of capital stock.  Such vote shall be determined by the holder(s) of a majority of the then issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.  For example, if there are 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding at the time of such shareholder vote, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, will have the right to vote an aggregate of 10,408 shares, out of a total number of 20,408 shares voting.  

Additionally, the Company is prohibited from adopting any amendments to the Company's Bylaws, Articles of Incorporation, as amended, making any changes to the Series A Certificate, or effecting any reclassification of the Series A Preferred Stock, without the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. However, the Company may, by any means authorized by law and without any vote of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, make technical, corrective, administrative or similar changes to the Series A Certificate that do not, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect the rights or preferences of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

The shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were automatically redeemed by the Company at their par value on a date 90 days after the effective date of the Series A Certificate.

Series B Preferred Stock 

Effective March 3, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the issuance of 16,155 shares of Series B Preferred Stock having a face value of $1,615,500 to holders of convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,615,362 payable by the Company (the "Prior Notes"), in exchange for the redemption and cancellation of the Prior Notes, including all outstanding principal of $1,615,362 and unpaid interest, which has been accruing at 10% per annum.

9 

INDEX  

At the date of conversion, the Prior Notes and accrued interest payable consisted of the following:

On March 2, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation for its Series B Preferred Stock (the "Series B Certificate") with the Secretary of State of Nevada designating 30,000 shares of its authorized preferred stock as Series B Preferred Stock. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock have a par value of $0.001 per share.

The total face value of this entire series is three million dollars ($3,000,000). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock has a stated face value of One Hundred Dollars ($100) ("Share Value"), and is convertible into shares of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock ("Common Stock") of the Company.

The holders of outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock (the "Holders") are entitled to receive dividends pari passu with the holders of Common Stock, except upon a liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company, in which case the Series B Preferred Stock has a preference.  Such dividends will be paid equally to all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on an as-if-converted basis with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock.  The Holders may elect to use the most favorable conversion price for the purpose of determining the as-if-converted number of shares.

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary, the Holder of each outstanding share of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its shareholders upon such liquidation, whether such assets are capital or surplus of any nature, an amount equal to one hundred dollars ($100) for each such share of the Series B Preferred Stock (as adjusted for any combinations, consolidations, stock distributions, stock splits or stock dividends with respect to such shares), plus all dividends, if any, declared and unpaid thereon as of the date of such distribution, before any payment is made or any assets distributed to the holders of the Common Stock.  After such payment, the remaining assets of the Company will be distributed to the holders of Common Stock.

If the assets to be distributed to the Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the receipt by such Holders of the full preferential amounts, then all of such assets will be distributed among such Holders ratably in accordance with the number of such shares then held by each such Holder.

The sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization, own less than fifty percent (50%) of the Company's voting power immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization, or any transaction or series of related transactions to which the Company is a party in which in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Company's voting power is transferred, excluding any consolidation or merger effected exclusively to change the domicile of the Company, is deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

10 

INDEX  

The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock.

The Holder has the right, at any time, at its election, to convert all or part of the Share Value into shares of Common Stock. The conversion price is the lesser of (1) Fifty Percent (50%) of the lowest trade price of Common Stock recorded on any trade day after December 12, 2012 or (2) the lowest effective price per share granted to any person or entity, including the Holder but excluding officers and directors of the Company, to acquire Common Stock, or adjusted, whether by operation of purchase price adjustment, settlement agreements, exchange agreements, reset provision, floating conversion or otherwise, any outstanding warrant, option or other right to acquire Common Stock or outstanding Common Stock equivalents (the "Conversion Price").

The conversion formula is as follows: The number of shares receivable upon conversion equals the Share Value divided by the Conversion Price. A conversion notice (the "Conversion Notice") may be delivered to Company by any method of Holder's choice (including but not limited to email, facsimile, mail, overnight courier, or personal delivery), and all conversions will be cashless and not require further payment from the Holder. If no objection is delivered from the Company to the Holder, with respect to any variable or calculation reflected in the Conversion Notice, within 24 hours of delivery of the Conversion Notice, the Company will thereafter be deemed to have irrevocably confirmed and ratified such notice of conversion and waived any objection. The Company will deliver the shares of Common Stock from any conversion to the Holder (in any name directed by the Holder) within three (3) business days of Conversion Notice delivery. If the Company is participating in the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated Securities Transfer ("FAST") program, then upon request of the Holder and provided that the shares to be issued are eligible for transfer under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or are effectively registered under the Securities Act, the Company will cause its transfer agent to electronically issue the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder through the DTC Direct Registration System ("DRS"). If the Company is not participating in the DTC FAST program, then the Company agrees in good faith to apply and cause the approval for participation in the DTC FAST program.

The Conversion Price is subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Company relating to the Company's securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Company, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events. No fractional shares of the Common Stock shall be issuable upon the conversion of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and the Company shall pay the cash equivalent of any fractional share upon such conversion.

If the Company fails to deliver shares in accordance with the required time frame, then for each conversion, a penalty of $1,500 per day will be assessed for each day after the third business day (inclusive of the day of the conversion) until share delivery is made.  Such penalty may be converted into Common Stock at the Conversion Price or payable in cash, at the sole option of the Holder (under the Holder's and the Company's expectations that any penalty amounts shall tack back to the original date of the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, consistent with applicable securities laws).

In no event will the Holder be entitled to convert any Series B Preferred Stock, such that upon conversion the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of this Series B Preferred Stock or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to these limitations), and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of Series B Preferred Stock, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.  The limitations on conversion may be waived by the Holder upon, at the election of the Holder, not less than 61 days prior notice to the Company, and the provisions of the conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date, as determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such notice of waiver).

11 

INDEX  

Except as required by law, the Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote, as a separate class or otherwise, on any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Company (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting).  Each Holder of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled, on the same basis as holders of Common Stock, to receive notice of such action or meeting.

So long as any shares of the Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without first obtaining the approval (by vote or written consent, as provided by law) of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock voting together as one class: (a) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock so as to affect materially and adversely such shares; or (b) create any new class of shares having preference over the Series B Preferred Stock.

The Holder has the right, at its sole discretion, to elect a fixed conversion price for the Series B Preferred Stock.  The Fixed Conversion Price may not be lower than the Conversion Price.  The Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of the Series B Certificate, and will at all times carry out all the provisions of the Series B Certificate.

Common Stock 

On April 20, 2016, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock from 1,000,000,000 to 100,000,000 and to affect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of its authorized, issued and outstanding shares of common stock.  The Company has given retroactive affect for the reverse stock split in all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

On April 29, 2016, our Board of Directors and the holder of a majority of the total issued and outstanding voting stock of the Company authorized and approved an amendment to the Company's articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 2,000,000,000.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued a total of 3,028,018 shares of common stock at fair value in conversion of $10,450 of convertible promissory notes and accrued interest payable of $3,176.  In connection with the debt conversion, the Company increased common stock by $3,028 and additional paid-in capital by $83,359, reduced derivative liabilities by $33,756 and recognized a loss of $39,005 on conversion of the notes.  The Company also increased the number of common shares by 816 shares pursuant to the reverse stock split, increasing common stock by $1 and decreasing additional paid-in capital by $1.

4.  STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

Stock Options 

As of September 30, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company had granted non-qualified stock options exercisable for a total of 1,410,000 shares of common stock to its employees, officers, and consultants.   Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and recognized over the period in which the award vests, which is generally 25 months.  Stock-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense was $0 and $8,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0 and $25,200 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, we had no unrecognized stock-based compensation expense.

INDEX  

A summary of the Company's stock option awards as of September 30, 2016, and changes during the nine months then ended is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on the closing price of our common stock of $0.0658 as of September 30, 2016, which would have been received by the holders of in-the-money options had the option holders exercised their options as of that date.

Warrants 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had 46,000 common stock purchase warrants outstanding, with an exercise price of $5.00 per share and expiring on various dates in 2017 and 2018.

5.  CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE

Convertible Promissory Note - $299,212

6.  DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES

The fair value of the Company's derivative liabilities is estimated at the issuance date and is revalued at each subsequent reporting date.    For purpose of estimating the fair value of the derivative liability associated with our convertible notes payable, we used the Black Scholes option valuation model.  The significant assumptions used in the Black Scholes valuation of the derivative liability at September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

The value of the derivative liability associated with our convertible notes payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was estimated at $6,971,276 and $13,184,369, respectively.  These inputs are subject to significant changes and market fluctuations from period to period; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability will fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuation may be material.

For purpose of estimating the fair value of the derivative liability associated with our Series B preferred stock, we used a multinomial lattice model based on projections of various potential future outcomes.  The significant assumptions used in the valuation of the derivative liability at September 30, 2016 are as follows:

The value of the derivative liability associated with our Series B convertible stock at September 30, 2016 was estimated at $4,574,930.  These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period and to management's judgment; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material.

9.  RESEARCH AGREEMENTS AND FORMATION OF SUBSIDIARY

On June 18, 2014, we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement ("SRA #1") with UCSB, pursuant to which UCSB performed research work for the mutual benefit of UCSB and the Company.  The purpose of SRA #1 included the development of a low-cost and scalable method to produce large-area graphene for transparent electrode applications.  The term of SRA #1 commenced on July 1, 2014 and expired on June 30, 2015.  The total cost to the Company was $387,730, which has been fully paid.  The Company amortized the SRA #1 payments over the life of the contract.

On December 15, 2015, we entered into another Sponsored Research Agreement ("SRA #2") with UCSB, pursuant to which UCSB will perform research work for the mutual benefit of UCSB and the Company.  The purpose of SRA #2 includes the development of a graphene based optical modulator for the high-speed transmission of digital data in fiber optic networks.

Transphene is formed to commercialize any technology that the Company licenses out of SRA #1. In consideration for its interest in Transphene, the Company assigned to Transphene the intellectual property rights acquired by the Company from SRA #1.  The Company and Banerjee also entered into a Shareholders' Agreement pursuant to which the Company and Banerjee agreed to (i) vote their shares to elect Mr. William E. Beifuss, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Banerjee as the directors of Transphene and (ii) not sell or transfer shares until the selling shareholder first offers its shares to the other shareholder.  Through September 30, 2016, the Company has not licensed any intellectual property from UCSB and therefore has not assigned any intellectual property to Transphene.  There have been no financial transactions in Transphene and no impact on our consolidated financial statements. At this time, the Company does not see an opportunity to commercialize the research findings from SRA #1.  The Company does not intend to continue Transphene, and expects to terminate, wind-up and dissolve the subsidiary in 2016.  Any future inter-company transactions will be eliminated in consolidation.

You should read the following description of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report.

OVERVIEW

Effective September 16, 2014, Carbon Sciences, Inc. ("Carbon Sciences," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") determined to change the focus of its business from developing a technology to convert natural gas into liquid fuel to  developing graphene-based technologies and devices. If successfully developed and commercialized, we plan to license our graphene technology to other companies.   The technology, which we are developing in conjunction with the University of California, Santa Barbara ("UCSB"), is intended to develop a new graphene-based optical modulator, a critical fiber optics component for enabling ultrafast communication in data centers for Cloud computing. 

On June 18, 2014, we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement ("SRA #1") with UCSB, pursuant to which UCSB performed research work for the mutual benefit of UCSB and the Company.  The purpose of SRA #1 includes the development of a low-cost and scalable method to produce large-area graphene for transparent electrode applications.  The term of SRA #1 commenced on July 1, 2014 and expired on June 30, 2015.  The total cost to the Company was $387,730, which has been fully paid.  

On December 15, 2015, we entered into another  Sponsored Research Agreement ("SRA #2")  with UCSB,  pursuant to which UCSB will perform research work for the mutual benefit of UCSB and the Company.  The purpose of SRA #2 includes the development of a graphene based optical modulator for the high-speed transmission of digital data in fiber optic networks.  The term of SRA #2, as amended on May 19, 2016, commenced on January 1, 2016 and expired on September 30, 2016.  The total cost to the Company is $65,497. 

23 

INDEX  

On February 9, 2016, we announced a growth-by-acquisition strategy to extend our presence in the information technology ("IT") market.  On March 7, 2016, we announced that Christopher S. Kelly joined the Company to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and help execute the growth-by-acquisition strategy.

We have not yet generated revenues.  We currently have negative working capital and received an opinion from our independent auditors on our consolidated financial statements that expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.   The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities, and commitments in the normal course of business.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital.  Since our inception through September 30, 2016, the Company has obtained funds primarily from the issuance of common stock and debt.  Management believes this funding will continue, and is continually seeking new investors.  Management believes the existing shareholders and lenders and prospective new investors will provide the additional cash needed to meet our obligations as they become due, and will allow the development of our core of business.  However, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available upon terms that are acceptable to us, if at all.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP.  The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and fair value computations using the Black Scholes and other option pricing models.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions, such as the trading value of our common stock and estimated future undiscounted cash flows, that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates, including those for the above-described items, are reasonable.

Use of Estimates

In accordance with GAAP, management utilizes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  These estimates and assumptions relate to recording net revenue, collectability of accounts receivable, useful lives and impairment of tangible and intangible assets, accruals, income taxes, inventory realization, stock-based compensation expense and other factors.  Management believes it has exercised reasonable judgment in deriving these estimates.  Consequently, a change in conditions could affect these estimates.

INDEX  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that value.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts reported for cash, accrued interest and other expenses, and notes payable approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.

We adopted ASC Topic 820 (originally issued as SFAS 157, "Fair Value Measurements") as of January 1, 2008 for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:

Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;

Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.

We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.  Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

25 

INDEX  

Derivative Liabilities

We have identified the conversion features of our convertible notes payable and our Series B preferred stock as derivatives.  We estimate the fair value of the derivatives associated with our convertible notes payable using the Black-Scholes pricing model and estimate the fair value of the derivatives associated with our Series B preferred stock using a multinomial lattice model based on projections of various potential future outcomes.  We estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities at the inception of the financial instruments, at the date of conversions to equity and at each reporting date, recording a derivative liability, debt discount, additional paid-in capital and a gain or loss on change in derivative liabilities as applicable.  These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain outcomes based on management projections.  These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period and to management's judgment; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and recognized over the period in which the award vests.  For stock awards no longer expected to vest, any previously recognized stock compensation expense is reversed in the period of termination.  The stock-based compensation expense is included in general and administrative expenses.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Management reviewed new accounting pronouncements issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and through the date of filing this report, and believes no pronouncements are applicable to or would have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company.

Results of Operations

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased by $107,431 to $149,607 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $42,176 in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased by $203,197 to $476,234 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $273,037 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in general and administrative expenses in the current year is due primarily to increases in salary, legal, and other office expenses.

26 

INDEX  

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses decreased by $105,000 to $0 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $105,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and decreased by $233,368 to $65,497 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $298,865 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in research and development expenses in the current year first quarter is due primarily to the decrease in amounts expensed related to SRA #1. Research and development expenses in the current year of $65,497 are comprised of the cost to the Company for SRA #2, which expired on  September 30, 2016.   

Depreciation and Amortization Expense

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $123 to $175 in  the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $52 in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and increased by $287 to $443 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $156 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   Our investment in property and equipment currently is not material to our operations, and substantially all of our property and equipment is fully depreciated at September 30, 2016. 

Other Income (Expense)

Total other expense was $1,461,552 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to total other income of $16,883,645 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Total other expense was $4,460,760 and $6,400,859 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Fluctuations in total other income (expense) from period to period result primarily from changes in our derivative liabilities.

We reported a loss on change in derivative liabilities of $1,356,170 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a gain on change in derivative liabilities of $17,092,006 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  We reported a loss on change in derivative liabilities of $3,808,170 and $5,880,131 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   We estimate the fair value of the derivatives associated with our convertible notes payable using the Black-Scholes pricing model and estimate the fair value of the derivatives associated with our Series B preferred stock using a multinomial lattice model based on projections of various potential future outcomes.  These estimates are based on multiple inputs, including the market price of our stock, interest rates, our stock price volatility, variable conversion prices based on market prices as defined in the respective agreements and probabilities of certain outcomes based on management projections.  These inputs are subject to significant changes from period to period and to management's judgment; therefore, the estimated fair value of the derivative liabilities will fluctuate from period to period, and the fluctuation may be material. 

Our interest expense decreased by $103,521 to $113,433 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $216,954 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease is the result of converting significant amounts of debt to Series B preferred stock in March 2016.  Our interest expense increased by $89,567 to $637,739 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $548,172 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The year-to-date increase is the result of interest on new debt incurred to finance our operations, including the amortization of related debt discount, partially offset by the decrease in debt in March 2016 when significant amounts of debt were converted to Series B preferred stock.

27 

INDEX  

We recognized a gain on settlement of debt of $542 in the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulting from the conversion of debt to equity.  We recognized a loss on settlement of debt of $39,005 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and a gain on settlement of debt of $5,660 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulting from the conversion of debt.

We have also reported rental income from the sublease of our office space that is not material to our operations.

Net Loss

As a result, we had a net loss of $1,611,334 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and net income of $16,736,417 in the three months ended September 30, 2015 and a net loss of $5,002,934 and $6,972,917 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $11,941,030 compared to a working capital deficit of $15,031,642 as of December 31, 2015.  The decrease in the working capital deficit was due primarily to the decrease in our non-cash derivative liabilities and the conversion of convertible debt to Series B preferred stock in March 2016.  Our cash balance at September 30, 2016 was $35,694.

Series B Preferred Stock

Effective March 3, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the issuance of 16,155 shares of Series B preferred stock having a face value of $1,615,500 to holders of convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,615,362 payable by the Company (the "Prior Notes"), in exchange for the redemption and cancellation of the Prior Notes, including all outstanding principal of $1,615,362 and unpaid interest totaling $264,530.  See Note 3 to Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a detail discussion of the features of the Series B preferred stock.

The holders of the Series B preferred stock have the right, at any time, at their election, to convert all or part of the Share Value into shares of the Company's common stock. The conversion price is the lesser of (1) Fifty Percent (50%) of the lowest trade price of the Company's common stock recorded on any trade day after December 12, 2012 or (2) the lowest effective price per share granted to any person or entity to acquire shares of the Company's common stock, including the holders but excluding officers and directors of the Company.

March 2016 Convertible Promissory Note   $1,000,000

On March 4, 2016, we entered into a convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 (the "March 2016 $1,000,000 CPN").  The lender may advance the Company consideration in such amounts as the lender may choose in its sole discretion.  The note is convertible into shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of: $0.003; 50% of the lowest trade price of our common stock subsequent to the effective date of the note; or the lowest effective price per share granted to any person or entity (exclusive of our officers and directors) to acquire common stock subsequent to the effective date of the note.

We received proceeds of $25,000 on March 4, 2016, $27,000 on March 14, 2016, $33,000 on March 17, 2016, $90,000 on April 11, 2016, $60,000 on May 19, 2016, $50,000 on June 22, 2016, $87,000 on July 6, 2016, $60,000 on August 5, 2016 and $55,000 on September 13, 2016 pursuant to the March 2016 $1,000,000 CPN.  The note matures, with respect to each advance, one year from the effective date of each advance.

INDEX  

Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used net cash of $529,097 in operating activities as a result of our net loss of $5,002,934, an increase in prepaid expenses of $6,638 and a decrease in accounts payable of $4,877, partially offset by non-cash expenses totaling $4,434,527 and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $50,825.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we used net cash of $477,144 in operating activities as a result of our net loss of $6,972,917, non-cash gain of $5,660 and a decrease in accounts payable of $12,569, partially offset by non-cash expenses totaling $6,345,271, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $61,485 and an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $107,246.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $1,472 in investing activities, comprised of the purchase of property and equipment.  We had no net cash provided by or used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $528,567, comprised of proceeds from convertible notes payable of $537,000, partially offset by repayment of convertible notes payable of $8,433.  Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $482,000, comprised of proceeds from convertible notes payable.

Our capital needs have primarily been met from the proceeds of investor loans, as we currently have no revenues.

Although most recently, proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt and convertible preferred stock are sufficient to fund our current operating expenses, we will need to raise additional funds in the future to continue our operations and emerge from the development stage.  Therefore, our future operations are dependent on our ability to secure additional financing.  Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.  However, the trading price of our common stock and a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities.  Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.  Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock.  The inability to obtain additional capital may restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations.  If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may have to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations.

We believe that we have assets to ensure that we can continue to operate without liquidation over the next twelve months, due to our current cash, and our experience in the past of being able to raise money from our investor base.  Therefore, we believe we have the ability to continue our operations for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of our operations.

INDEX  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liabilities, and commitments in the normal course of business.  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company does not generate any revenue, and has negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional capital.  Since our inception through September 30, 2016, the Company has obtained funds primarily from the issuance of common stock and debt.  Management believes this funding will continue, and is continually seeking new investors.  Management believes the existing shareholders and lenders and prospective new investors will provide the additional cash needed to meet the Company's obligations as they become due, and will allow the development of its core of business.  However, we cannot assure that we will be successful in these endeavors.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's president and chief financial officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president and chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).  Based upon this evaluation, our president and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).  The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  After evaluating the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, the Company's president and chief financial officer concluded that the internal controls over financial reporting are effective as of September 30, 2016.
