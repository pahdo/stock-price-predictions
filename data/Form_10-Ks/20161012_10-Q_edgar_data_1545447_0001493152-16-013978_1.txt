1.
Organization   

Valmie
Resources, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated on August 26, 2011, in the State of Nevada, U.S.A. The accounting
and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US
GAAP ), and the Company s fiscal year end is November 30.  

In
early December 2014, the Company changed its business focus from mining to pursuing opportunities for the commercialization of
leading edge products and services in the rapidly expanding technology industry.  

On
March, 31, 2015, the Company acquired 100% interest in Vertitek Inc., a Wyoming corporation ( Vertitek ). Vertitek
was established to provide unmanned vehicle software, hardware and cloud services for a wide range of commercial applications
around the globe. Vertitek is in the process of developing the V-1 Drone SM , a cutting edge multi-rotor UAV designed
specifically to meet the requirements of a growing commercial user base.  

On
April 15, 2016, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement to form AeroLift eXpress LLC ( AeroLift ). The
Company owns 50% of AeroLift and has committed funding up to $500,000 to launch the AeroLift business model.  

2.
Basis of Presentation   

Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).
They do not include all information and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. However, except as disclosed
herein, there have been no material changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements for the year
ended November 30, 2015, included in the Company s Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the Form 10-K. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, have been made.
Operating results for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the year ending November 30, 2016.

Acquisition of Vertitek Inc.   

On
March 31, 2015, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares
of Vertitek. Vertitek was previously named Landstar Leasing, Inc. ( Landstar ) and was incorporated pursuant to the
Wyoming Business Corporation Act on February 19, 2014. On November 19, 2014, Landstar changed its name to Vertitek Inc. As a result
of the acquisition, Vertitek became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  

In
December 2014, the Company changed its business focus from mining to opportunities in the technology industry. The acquisition
of Vertitek enables the Company to pursue its new business focus as Vertitek has focused on the development of unmanned vehicle
software, hardware and cloud services for a wide range of commercial applications around the globe. Vertitek is in the process
of developing the V-1 Drone SM , a cutting edge multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) designed specifically
to meet the requirements of a growing commercial user base.  

The
acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with US GAAP as Vertitek did not meet the definition of a
business. Vertitek did not consist of sufficient processes (systems, standards, protocols, conventions or rules) that would be
able to be applied to those inputs and have the ability to create outputs as required by Accounting Standards Codification 805.  

In
exchange for common stock of $2,770,000, the Company acquired $18,355 of financial assets, $2,777,145 of intangible assets related
to intellectual property and $25,500 of financial liabilities. The total value of the intangible assets related to intellectual
property ($2,777,145) was impaired and written-off as of November 30, 2015.

Investment in Partnership   

On
April 15, 2016, the Company and its partner, James Stafford, a Texas resident ( Stafford ) (collectively the  Members ),
organized a joint venture entity, AeroLift Express LLC ( AeroLift ), to develop and launch integrated service and
solution offerings utilizing the latest advancements in the UAV industry.  

The
material terms of the joint venture agreement between the Members are as follows:  

The
    Company will contribute to AeroLift startup financing in periodic amounts, the total of which will not exceed $500,000. Such
    financing will be made available to AeroLift in monthly installments of $25,000 for the first 3 months from the date of execution
    of the joint venture agreement (paid).    

AeroLift
    will set aside a reserve fund, for operations, payroll, expansion, and employee bonuses from AeroLift s after-tax profit.
    The ratio of the reserve fund to AeroLift s after-tax profit will not be lower than 10% and may be a higher percentage
    with unanimous approval of the Members. The distributed profit, which is the profit after above funds have been allocated,
    will be distributed to Members, in proportion to their member interests.

carrying value of $63,611 at August 31, 2016 (November 30, 2015   $Nil) includes $122,000 in advances plus the Company s
share of the cumulative net loss of AeroLift of $58,389 (November 30, 2015   $Nil).

but unissued  blank check  preferred stock, par value $0.001, as Series  A  preferred stock. The shares
of Series  A  preferred stock carry certain rights and preferences and may be converted into shares of the Company s
common stock on a 10 for one (1) basis at any time after 18 months from the date of issuance, and that each share of Series  A

During
the period ended August 31, 2016, the Company entered into multiple promissory note agreements with Investor D for an aggregate
amount of $172,500 ($102,500 in aggregate during the year ended November 30, 2015). The promissory notes mature two years from
the date of the inception of the notes and bear simple interest at an annual interest rate of 15%. The notes are secured by all
of the assets, properties, goods, inventory, equipment, furniture, fixtures, leases, supplies, records, money, documents, instruments,
chattel paper, accounts, intellectual property rights (including but not limited to, copyrights, moral rights, patents, patent
applications, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets) and other general intangibles, whether owned by Company on
the date of the note or hereafter acquired, and all proceeds thereof. On April 27, 2016, $200,000 of the promissory notes was
settled through the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of common stock, and the associated accrued interest of $13,854 was waived. The
Company recognized a loss of $266,146 in connection with the debt settlement. During the period ended August 31, 2016, the Company
repaid the remaining promissory notes in full for an aggregate amount of $75,000.

Going Concern and Liquidity Considerations   

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at August 31,
2016, the Company had working capital of $634 (November 30, 2015   working capital deficiency of $55,866) and an accumulated
deficit of $14,538,599 (November 30, 2015   $13,937,744). The Company intends to fund operations through equity financing
arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the
next 12 months.  

The
ability of the Company to continue in existence is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue
operations and the operations of both Vertitek and Aerolift.  

In
response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.  

These
factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

11.
Commitments   

Pursuant
to a letter of intent dated July 7, 2015, the Company is obligated to pay one vendor $5,000 for costs incurred to construct a
prototype and testing of such prototype. As at August 31, 2016, $3,000 has been paid in relation to this obligation.  

12.
Subsequent Events   

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events from August 31, 2016, through the date these financial statements were issued and determined
that there are no additional items to disclose.

causes and trends should not be construed to imply any conclusion that these results or trends will necessarily continue into
the future.  

Overview   

We
were incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on August 26, 2011. We have one wholly owned subsidiary, Vertitek
Inc., a Wyoming corporation ( Vertitek ), and a 50% interest in a joint venture entity, AeroLift eXpress, LLC, a Wyoming
limited liability corporation ( AeroLift ). From our inception until the quarter ended August 31, 2014, we were a
mineral exploration company exploring for precious metals, or gold and silver targets. Our property, known as the Carico Lake
Valley Property (the  Property ), was located in Lander County, Nevada.  

In
July 2014, the landowner notified us that our option to acquire an interest in the Property had been terminated and that the Property
had been sold to a third party. Our efforts from that date until the end of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2014, were primarily
directed to identifying new development properties.  

In
early December 2014, our majority shareholder determined it was in the best interests of our shareholders to change our business
focus from mining to pursuing opportunities for the commercialization of leading edge products and services in the rapidly expanding
technology industry. We therefore sought to develop or acquire concepts with valid business models positioned to make a significant
impact within the four key technology  megasectors : software, hardware, networking and semiconductors.  

Business
Strategy   

The
first major step in our shift to the technology sector was the appointment of Gerald B. Hammack as our sole officer and director
on December 8, 2014. Mr. Hammack has more than 30 years of experience in a variety of technology-related fields, including programming,
digital telephony and database management, as well as substantial expertise in the setup and management of complex data processing
systems.  

Over
the past several years, Mr. Hammack has been developing a series of software platforms and technologies designed to provide the
near real-time data processing required by the ever-expanding use of commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or UAVs (more commonly
referred to as drones). Towards the end of 2014, we rebranded Mr. Hammack s development efforts as the AIMD (Automated Intelligence
for Mobile Devices) data processing platform and adopted them as our own. On July 15, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase
agreement with Mr. Hammack pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to the intellectual property
relating to the AIMD platform in consideration for the issuance of $100,000 worth of our common stock to Mr. Hammack on that date
at a deemed price of $0.47 per share. Since we did not acquire any patents from Mr. Hammack, we recognized an intangible asset
value of $100,000 related to the acquisition.  

While
in the process of launching the AIMD platform, we determined that it would be necessary to find a partner that had the technology
and experience in the design and manufacture of UAVs in order to design and build prototype units to test and refine our product
and service offerings. After extensive investigation we located a UAV manufacturer, Vertitek. Vertitek s hardware and software
technology is being designed to enable a sophisticated level of autonomy for UAVs and other autonomous mobilized devices, including
precision guidance controls and advanced safety features. Vertitek has several under development commercial UAVs, each of which
is a multi-rotor platform that incorporates an integrated, fully autonomous autopilot that can be connected to, and controlled
from, the AIMD platform.  

On
January 27, 2015 we entered into a share exchange agreement with Vertitek and the sole shareholder of Vertitek, Masamos Services
Ltd., a Cypriot corporation ( Masamos ), to acquire 100% of the capital stock of Vertitek in exchange for the issuance
of shares of our common stock to Masamos. On March 31, 2015, the closing of the share exchange agreement occurred and we issued
1,000,000 shares of our common stock to Masamos in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Vertitek. As a result,
Vertitek became our wholly owned subsidiary.  

On
April 15, 2016, we entered into a joint venture agreement with James Stafford to form AeroLift (the  Joint Venture Agreement ).
Pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement, we currently own 50% of AeroLift and have committed funding up to $500,000 to launch
the AeroLift business model, of which $122,000 had been advanced as of August 31, 2016. AeroLift is led by a team of military
trained pilots, mission commanders and specialists with more than 60 years of combined aviation experience. AeroLift s aircraft
are military grade construction adapted for commercial applications. Together with state of the art ground control stations and
flight control software, AeroLift intends to deliver cutting edge unmanned services to clients in a variety of challenging environments.  

To
date, we have not generated any revenue through the sales of UAVs or the provision of software, hardware or cloud based services,
either through Vertitek, AeorLift or otherwise. As we are still developing our technologies, we have not yet launched our manufacturing,
sales or marketing operations and have not yet identified any customers for our systems or solutions.  

We
have never declared bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings nor have we had any material reclassifications, mergers,
consolidations, or purchases or sales of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.  

Results
of Operations   

Revenues   

We
have not generated any revenue since our inception. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future
and our ability to generate any revenue during the next 12 months continues to be uncertain.  

Three
Months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015   

Expenses   

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred $113,111 in operating expenses, including $45,263 in professional fees, $43,353
in general and administrative expenses, $22,500 in management fees and $1,995 in transfer agent fees. During the same period in
fiscal 2015, we incurred $190,229 in operating expenses, including $177,280 in professional fees, $15,000 in management fees and
$1,775 in transfer agent fees, as offset by a $3,286 gain in general and administrative expenses. The $77,118 decrease in our
operating expenses between the two periods was therefore primarily attributable to the significant decrease in our professional
fees, which was in turn related to our obligations under a consulting agreement we entered into on September 1, 2014 that was
amended effective February 28, 2015 to cancel the fixed monthly fee. During the three months ended August 31, 2016, however, our
general and administrative expenses increased due to a general increase in our operations.  

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred other expenses of $57,227, including a $56,773 equity loss associated with
the AeroLift joint venture and $454 in interest expenses, whereas we did not incur any other expenses during the same period in
fiscal 2015.  

Net
Loss   

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss from operations of $113,111, a net loss of $170,338, and a net
loss per share of $0.00. During the same period in fiscal 2015, we incurred a net loss from operations of $190,229, which was
equal to our net loss, and a net loss per share of $0.00.  

Nine
Months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015   

Expenses   

During
the nine months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred $263,007 in operating expenses, including $120,288 in professional fees, $84,775
in general and administrative expenses, $52,500 in management fees and $5,444 in transfer agent fees. During the same period in
fiscal 2015, we incurred $407,144 in operating expenses, including $345,740 in professional fees, $20,476 in general and administrative
expenses, $37,000 in management fees and $3,928 in transfer agent fees. The decrease in our operating expenses between the two
periods was largely attributable to the decrease in our professional fees as described above, as offset by increases in our general
and administrative expenses and management fees.  

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred other expenses of $337,855, including a $337,848 loss on the settlement of
debt, all of which was related to issuances of common stock to one creditor below market value, a $58,389 equity loss associated
with the AeroLift joint venture, and $13,313 in interest expenses. During the same period in fiscal 2015, we incurred other expenses
of $10,403,232, including a $10,404,422 loss on the settlement as offset by an interest gain of $1,190. That loss on the settlement
of debt was entirely due to issuances of common stock to various creditors that we completed on April 6, 2015, including 3,500,000
shares pursuant to the settlement of various promissory notes at a deemed price of $0.10 per share, which was well below the market
price of our common stock on that day.  

Net
Loss   

During
the nine months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss from operations of $263,007, a net loss of $600,855, and a net loss
per share of $0.01. During the same period in fiscal 2015, we incurred a net loss from operations of $407,144, a net loss of $10,810,376
and a net loss per share of $0.07.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As
of August 31, 2016, we had $45,717 in cash and cash equivalents, $146,067 in current assets, $243,697 in total assets, $45,433
in current and total liabilities, a working capital surplus of $100,634 and a retained deficit of $14,538,599.  

During
the nine months ended August 31, 2016, we used $298,362 in net cash on operating activities due to a combination of our adjusted
net loss and certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities, including a $35,355 decrease in our accounts payable and
$13,313 in interest accrual. During the same period in fiscal 2015 we used $290,275 in net cash on operating activities due primarily
to our adjusted net loss and a $116,342 increase in our accounts payable. The majority of our spending on operating activities
for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 was attributable to our net loss as described above, as adjusted for any equity
loss on the AeroLift joint venture and loss on the settlement of debt, and was associated with carrying out our reporting obligations
under applicable securities laws and pursuing opportunities for the commercialization of products and services in the technology
industry.  

During
the nine months ended August 31, 2016, we used $123,287 in net cash on investing activities, including our initial $122,000 investment
in AeroLift. During the same period in fiscal 2015, we used $39,588 in net cash on investing activities, substantially all of
which was in the form of advances to Vertitek and prototype development costs.  

During
the nine months ended August 31, 2016, we received $444,490 from financing activities, including $346,990 in proceeds from the
sale of our common stock and $172,500 in proceeds from promissory notes, as offset by a $75,000 promissory note repayment. During
the same period in fiscal 2015, we received $320,000 from financing activities, all of which was in the form of proceeds from
promissory notes.  

During
the nine months ended August 31, 2016, our cash position increased by $22,841 due to a combination of our operating, investing
and financing activities.  

Our
plans for the next 12 months are uncertain due to our current financial condition; however, we intend to raise additional funds
through public or private placement offerings. If we are unsuccessful in raising enough money through such efforts, we may review
other financing possibilities such as bank loans. At this time we do not have a commitment from any broker-dealer to provide us
with financing. There is no assurance that any financing will be available to us or if available, on terms that will be acceptable
to us. In the absence of such financing, we may be forced to cease or significantly curtail our operations.  

Plan
of Operations    

We
will need to raise additional capital to carry out our business plan. We have a 24-month plan during which we intend to implement
business development and marketing initiatives in order to create a vertically integrated UAV goods and services provider that
covers all operational areas from technology development to the end user experience.  

We
believe we must raise approximately $1,900,000 to pay for expenses associated with the development and commercialization of the
products and services being offered by us, Vertitek and AeroLift. Of this, we plan to use $1,150,000 to finance our general and
administrative expenses as well as acquire new equipment and systems, which we in turn plan to lease to our subsidiaries; $250,000
to develop Vertitek and its latest offering, Vertitek Racing; and $500,000 to help launch AeroLift.  

Valmie   

During
the next 24 months, we will continue to focus on integrating and leveraging our operating subsidiaries, Vertitek and AeroLift,
to develop and expand our position within the commercial UAV industry. We plan to seek acquisition opportunities or joint venture
partners that will allow us to enter under-developed or under-served segments of the market, and intend to form a leasing entity
through which we will acquire the systems and technologies required by our operating subsidiaries and lease them at commercially
reasonable rates. Using this leasing system, we will be able to maintain control of our capital assets and allow our subsidiaries
to focus solely on revenue generating activities and serving the needs of their customers.  

Vertitek   

As
Vertitek continues to develop its product line of customized drone platforms and systems, it will expand its service offerings
to include specialized engineering and development support for us, AeroLift and any other entities in which we may acquire an
interest. The Vertitek Racing team and its competition schedule will allow engineers to use real world testing and results to
continue the development of Vertitek s offerings.  

AeroLift   

We
anticipate that the next 24 months will be an exciting time for AeroLift as it continues to work towards providing both time-critical
UAV delivery services and actionable intelligence delivered through military grade UAV systems not currently available to the
general public. A series of full-scale public and private demonstrations are planned for the winter of 2016, which will showcase
for potential customers the cost savings and safety benefits of using the services AeroLift offers.  

Continued
Funding   

We
believe that the remaining funding available to us under our Equity Investment Agreement with Tuverga Finance Ltd. ( Tuverga )
will be sufficient to cover our needs for the next 24 months. In the event that we require additional financing, such as for the
acquisition of UAV systems, we will likely approach Tuverga to participate in a separate transaction related solely to the acquisition
of those assets. We believe Tuverga would be willing to participate under commercially reasonable terms.  

If
we are unable to agree to terms with Tuverga, we intend to pursue capital through public or private financing as well as borrowings
and other sources, such as loans from our existing shareholders in order to finance our business activities. We cannot guarantee
that additional funding will be available on favourable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, then our ability
to continue our operations may be significantly hindered.  

Going
Concern   

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates, among other things, that we will continue
to realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business. As at August 31, 2016, we had a working capital
surplus of $634 and a retained deficit of $14,538,599. We intend to fund our operations through equity financing arrangements,
which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the next 12 months.  

Our
ability to continue in existence is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue our operations
and the operations of both Vertitek and AeroLift. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive and Chief Financial

4.  
      The Registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are
    responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
    and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for
    the Registrant and have:   

(a)  
      Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
    such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
    to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
    during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

(b)  
      Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or

      Evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant s disclosure
    controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
    procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and   

(d)  
      Disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant s
    internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant s
    fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and   

5.  
      The Registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have
    disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant s auditors
    and the audit committee of the Registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   

(a)  
      All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
    control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant s ability to record,
    process, summarize and report financial information; and   

(b)  
      Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
    a significant role in the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
