  Form 10-Q      
 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)     NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS   
 Melrose Bancorp, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in February 2014 under the laws of State of Maryland. The Company s activity consists of
owning and supervising its subsidiary, Melrose Cooperative Bank (the  Bank ). The Bank provides financial services to individuals, families and businesses through our full-service banking office. Our primary business activity consists of
taking deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial real
estate loans, and to a much lesser extent consumer loans. The Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered cooperative bank headquartered in Melrose, Massachusetts. The Bank is subject to the regulations of, and periodic examination by, the Massachusetts
Division of Banks ( DOB ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The Bank s deposits are insured by the FDIC.  
 The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
 The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Information included herein as of September 30, 2016 and for the interim periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited; however, in the opinion of management, all
adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and were of a normal recurring nature. These statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included
in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future periods, including the year ended December 31, 2016.    The significant
accounting policies are summarized below to assist the reader in better understanding the consolidated financial statements and other data contained herein.  
 BASIS OF PRESENTATION:    The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary the Bank, and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiary, MCBSC, Inc., which is used to hold investment securities. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation.    USE OF ESTIMATES:  
 In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, impairment of securities and deferred income taxes.

  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:  
 As of September 30, 2016 (unaudited), the Company has total cash and cash equivalents in the following banks:  
   
   As of December 31, 2015, the Company has total cash and cash equivalents in the following banks:  
   
   EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS):    Basic
EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to exclude the weighted average number of unallocated shares held by the ESOP. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that would occur
if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings of the entity. For the purposes of computing diluted EPS, the treasury
stock method is used.    The calculation of basic and diluted EPS (unaudited) is presented below.  

(1) 
 Options to purchase 224,200 shares, representing all outstanding options, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 because the effect
is anti-dilutive.      FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  
 Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 825,  Financial Instruments,  requires that the Company disclose the estimated fair value for its financial
instruments. Fair value methods and assumptions used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures are as follows:    Cash and cash equivalents:
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value.    Securities: Fair values for
securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.  
 Loans held-for-sale: Fair values of loans held-for-sale are based on commitments on hand from investors or prevailing market prices.  
      7  

Table of Contents  

  Loans receivable: For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk,
fair values are based on carrying values. The fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.  
 Accrued interest receivable: The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates fair value.  
 Deposit liabilities: The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings and money market accounts) are,
by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair values for fixed-rate certificate accounts are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently
being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on certificate accounts.    Federal Home Loan Bank advances: Fair
values for Federal Home Loan Bank advances are estimated using a discounted cash flow technique that applies interest rates currently being offered on advances to a schedule of aggregate expected monthly maturities on Federal Home Loan Bank
advances.    Off-balance sheet instruments: The fair value of commitments to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter similar
agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments and the unadvanced portion of loans, fair value also considers the difference between
current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:  
 As an  emerging growth company,  as defined in Title 1 of Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, the Company has elected to use the extended
transition period to delay adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements may not be
comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. As of September 30, 2016, there is no significant difference in the comparability of the financial statements as a result of
this extended transition period.    In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01,
 Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The amendments in this ASU address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and
disclosure of financial instruments and makes targeted improvements to GAAP as follows:      

1. 
 Require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
net income. However, the entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for
the identical or a similar investment of the same manner.        

2. 
 Simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an
entity is required to measure the investment at fair value.        

3. 
 Eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at
amortized cost on the balance sheet.        

4. 
 Require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.    

5. 
 Require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has
elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments.        

6. 
 Require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying
notes to the financial statements.        

7. 
 Clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.

  Under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company, the amendments in this Update are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of item 5 above is permitted as of the beginning of fiscal years or interim periods for which financial statements have not been
issued. Early adoption of all other amendments in this ASU is not permitted. The Company anticipates that the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  This ASU was issued to increase transparency and comparability among
organizations by requiring reporting entities to recognize all leases, including operating, as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Under the extended transition period for
an emerging growth company, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years being after December 15, 2020. The Company anticipates that the adoption of
this ASU will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and
presented in the financial statements. Some of the key provisions of this new ASU include: (1) companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in-capital ( APIC ). Instead, they will
record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, and APIC pools will be eliminated. The guidance also eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can
recognize them. In addition, the guidance requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity; (2) increase the amount an employer can withhold to cover
income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation. The new guidance will also require an employer to classify the cash
paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on its statement of cash flows (current guidance did not specify how these cash flows should be classified); and
(3) permit companies to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated, as required today, or recognized when they occur. Under the
extended transition period for an emerging growth company, ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 31, 2018. Early
adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326):
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The ASU requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable
and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although
the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Organizations will continue to use judgement to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances. Additionally, the ASU
amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. Under the extended transition period for an emerging growth company, this update will be effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the
amendments of ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  Current GAAP is unclear or does
not include specific guidance on how to classify certain transactions in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how eight particular transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. Under the
extended transition period for an emerging growth company, this update will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. Entities will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively. If it is impracticable to apply to the guidance retrospectively for an issue, the amendments
related to that issue would be applied prospectively. As this guidance only affects the classification with the statement of cash flows, ASU No. 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.

  NOTE 3 - INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES  
 Debt and equity securities have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets according to management s intent. The amortized cost basis of
securities and their approximate fair values are as follows:      
   The scheduled maturities of debt securities were as follows as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited):  
   
   Not included in the maturity table above is preferred stock with no stated maturity of $1,037,000 at September 30, 2016
(unaudited).    There were no securities of issuers whose aggregate carrying amount exceeded 10% of stockholders  equity as of September 30, 2016
(unaudited) and December 31, 2015.    During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited) proceeds from the sales of
available-for-sale securities were $576,000 and $8,439,000, respectively, and gross realized gains on these sales amounted to $279,000 and $572,000, respectively. The tax expense on the realized gains during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $92,000 and $188,000, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2015 (unaudited) there were no sales of available-for-sale securities. Proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, amounted to $1.9 million. The gross realized gains on these sales amounted to $489,000 and the gross realized losses were $80,000. The tax expense applicable to these net realized gains amounted to
$164,000.

  The Company had no pledged securities as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015.  
 The aggregate fair value and unrealized losses of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and for twelve
months or more, and are not other-than-temporarily impaired, are as follows:      
   The Company conducts periodic reviews of investment securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment is
other-than-temporary. The Company s review for impairment generally includes a determination of the cause, severity and duration of the impairment; and an analysis of both positive and negative evidence available. The Company also determines if
it has the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery to cost basis. In regard to corporate debt, the Company also considers the issuer s current financial condition and its
ability to make future scheduled interest and principal payments on a timely basis in assessing other-than-temporary impairment.    During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, the Company had no writedowns of securities. During the nine months ended 2015, there were five marketable equity securities that were declared other-than-temporarily impaired for which an impairment loss of $377,000
was recognized. A summary of the Company s reviews of investment securities deemed to be temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:  
 Unrealized losses on U.S. Government and federal agency obligations amounted to $65,000 and consisted of six securities. The unrealized losses on all but one
of these debt securities were individually less than 5.0% of amortized cost basis, with one U.S. government and federal agency obligation at 5.0%. Unrealized losses on municipal bonds amounted to $10,000 and consisted of one security. The unrealized
loss on this debt security was 3.8% of amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on corporate bonds amounted to $13,000 and consisted of four securities. The unrealized losses on all but one of these debt securities were individually less than 1.0% of
amortized cost basis, with one corporate bond obligation at 1.6%. Unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities amounted to $66,000 and consisted of four securities. The unrealized losses on these debt securities were 0.3%, 3.2%, 6.2% and 7.2% of
amortized cost basis, respectively. The unrealized losses were primarily due to changes in interest rates.

   Credit Quality Information   
 In early 2016, the Company implemented a new 10 point internal loan rating system for commercial real estate, construction and commercial loans. For
residential real estate and consumer loans, the Company initially assesses credit quality based upon the borrower s ability to pay and subsequently monitors these loans based on the borrower s ability to pay. The new risk rating system
will assist the Company in better understanding the risk inherent in each loan. The new loan ratings are as follows:    Loans rated 1: Secured by cash
collateral or highly liquid diversified marketable securities.    Loans rated 2   3: Strongest quality loans in the portfolio not secured by cash.
Defined by consistent, solid profits, strong cash flow and are well secured. Very little vulnerability to changing economic conditions and compare favorably to their industry.  
 Loans rated 4   5: These loans are pass rated. Borrower will show average to strong cash flow, strong to adequate collateral coverage, and will have a
generally sound balance sheet. Inclusive in the 5 rating are all open and closed   end residential and retail loans which are paying as agreed.  
 Loans rated 6: Possess above average risk but still considered pass. Generally this rating is reserved for projects currently under construction or borrowers
with modest cash flow, although still meeting all loan covenants.    Loans rated 6W: Contain all the risks of a 6 rated credit but have an inherent weakness
that requires close monitoring. This rating also generally includes open and closed-end residential and retail loans which are greater than 30 days past due but display no other inherent weakness.  
 Loans rated 7: Potential weaknesses which warrant management s close attention. If weaknesses are uncorrected, repayment prospects may be weakened. This
is typically a transitional rating.    Loans rated 8: Considered substandard. There is a likelihood of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Generally, open and closed   end retail loans, as well as automotive and other consumer loans past 90 cumulative days from the contractual due date should be classified as an 8.  
 Loans rated 9: Borrower has a pronounced weakness and all current information indicates collection or liquidation of all debts in full is improbable and
highly questionable.    Loans rated 10: Uncollectable and a loss will be taken. Open and closed   end loans secured by residential real estate that are
beyond 180 days past due will be assessed for value and any outstanding loan balance in excess of said value, less cost to sell, will be classified as a 10.  
 On an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company formally reviews the ratings on all commercial real estate and construction loans.  
 As of September 30, 2016 (unaudited), one- to four- family residential real estate loans with balances totaling $289,000 had a risk rating of  8 -
substandard  and all other loans outstanding had a risk rating of  1 to 6 - pass.     As of December 31, 2015, one- to four- family
residential real estate loans with balances totaling $366,000 and home equity lines of credit totaling $197,000 had a risk rating of  8 - substandard  and all other loans outstanding had a risk rating of  1 to 6 - pass.

   NOTE 5 - PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT   
 The following is a summary of premises and equipment:      
    NOTE 6 - DEPOSITS     The
aggregate amount of time deposit amounts in denominations that meet or exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limit of $250,000 as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015 amounted to $23,718,000
and $16,876,000, respectively.    For time deposits as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) the scheduled maturities for each of the following years ended
September 30 are as follows:      
   Deposits from related parties held by the Bank as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015 amounted
to $2,564,656 and $4,030,000, respectively.     NOTE 7 - BORROWED FUNDS   
 The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLB). The FHLB Borrowings are secured by a blanket lien by the FHLB on certain residential loans
or securities with a market value at least equal to the outstanding balances. The remaining maximum borrowing capacity with the FHLB at September 30, 2016 was approximately $104.9 million subject to the purchase of additional FHLB stock. At
September 30, 2016 the Company had a three year fixed rate amortizing advance totaling $5.0 million, with an interest rate of 1.42%, which matures on September 19, 2019. In addition, the Company has the ability to borrow from the
Co-operative Central Bank. The Company had no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015.     NOTE 8 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
 The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These
financial instruments include commitments to originate loans and unadvanced funds on loans. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets. The contract amounts of those
instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.    The Company s exposure to credit loss
in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional
obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  
      15  

Table of Contents  

  Commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any
condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount
of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include secured interests in mortgages, accounts receivable,
inventory, property, plant and equipment and income-producing properties.    Notional amounts of financial instrument liabilities with off-balance sheet
credit risk are as follows:      
    NOTE 9 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS   
 ASC 820-10,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  provides a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles.
This guidance also allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis.  
 In accordance with ASC 820-10, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets
in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.    Level 1 - Valuations for assets and
liabilities traded in active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities.  
 Level 2 - Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer or broker markets. Valuations are obtained from third party pricing services for
identical or comparable assets or liabilities.    Level 3 - Valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other methodologies, including
option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, are not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker traded transactions. Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value
assigned to such assets and liabilities.    A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that
is significant to the fair value measurement.    A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the
general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. These valuation methodologies were applied to all of the Company s financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value for
September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015. The Company did not have any significant transfers of assets between levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and the
year ended December 31, 2015.    The Company s investments in preferred stock and marketable equity securities are generally classified within
level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices.  
      16  

Table of Contents  

  The Company s investment in debt securities available-for-sale is generally classified within level 2 of the
fair value hierarchy. For these securities, we obtain fair value measurements from independent pricing services. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. treasury yield
curve, trading levels, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the instrument s terms and conditions.    Level 3 is for positions
that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such
evidence, management s best estimate is used. Subsequent to inception, management only changes level 3 inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments, completed or pending third-party
transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities, subsequent rounds of financing, recapitalization and other transactions across the capital structure, offerings in the equity or debt markets, and changes in financial ratios or cash
flows.    The following summarizes assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:  
   
   Under certain circumstances the Company makes adjustments to fair value for its assets and liabilities although they are not
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. At September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015, there were no assets or liabilities carried on the consolidated balance sheets for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been
recorded.

  The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments, all of which are held or issued for
purposes other than trading, are as follows:      
   The carrying amounts of financial instruments shown in the above tables are included in the consolidated balance sheets under
the indicated captions. Accounting policies related to financial instruments are described in Note 2.     NOTE 10 - OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME
    Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in
assets and liabilities are reported as a separate component of the stockholders  equity section of the consolidated balance sheets, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income.  
 The components of other comprehensive (loss) income, included in stockholders  equity, are as follows:  

(1) 
 Reclassification adjustments include net realized securities gains. Realized gains have been reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and affect certain captions in the consolidated statements of
income as follows: pre-tax amount for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is reflected as a gain on sale of securities, net of $279,000 and $572,000, respectively. The tax effect, included in income tax expense for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $92,000 and $188,000, respectively. Pre-tax amount for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, is reflected as a gain on sale securities, net of $0 and $409,000, respectively, and a
write-down of $0 and $377,000, respectively. The tax effect, included in income tax expense, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $11,000 for the period. The after tax amount is included in net income.

  Accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015
consists of net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities, net of taxes.     NOTE 11 - REGULATORY MATTERS   
 The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework
for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The
Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.  
 Effective January 1, 2015, (with a phase-in period of two to four years for certain components), the Bank became subject to new capital regulations
adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( FRB ) and the FDIC, which implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The new regulations require a new common equity
Tier 1 ( CET1 ) capital ratio of 4.5%, increase the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio to 6.0% from 4.0%, require a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio
of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock and retained earnings, subject to applicable adjustments and deductions. Under new prompt corrective action regulations, in order to be considered  well capitalized,  the Bank must maintain
a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% (new) and a Tier 1 ratio of 8.0% (increased from 6.0%), a total risk based capital ratio of 10.0% (unchanged) and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% (unchanged). In addition, the regulations establish a capital conservation
buffer above the required capital ratios that began phasing in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year by 0.625% until it is fully phased in at 2.5% effective January 1, 2019. Beginning
January 1, 2016, failure to maintain the capital conservation buffer will limit the ability of the Bank and the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses.  
 The new regulation implemented changes to what constitutes regulatory capital. Certain instruments will no longer constitute qualifying capital, subject to
phase-out periods. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated
percentages of CET1 will be deducted from capital.    The new regulations also changed the risk weights of certain assets, including an increase in the risk
weight of certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or on non-accrual status to 150% from 100%, a credit conversion factor for the
unused portion of the commitments with maturities of less than one year that are not cancellable to 20% from 0%, an increase in the risk weight for mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital to 250% from
100%, and an increase in the risk weight for equity exposures to 600% from 100%.    Management believes, as of September 30, 2016, that the Bank meets
all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.    As of September 30, 2016, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank
as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, Common Equity tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as
set forth in the following table. There were no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s category.  
 The Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios (unaudited) are presented in the following table.

   NOTE 12   COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES   
 From time to time, our board of directors authorizes stock repurchase plans. In general, stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital
position and return excess capital to shareholders. Shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. Our board of directors authorized a stock
repurchase program, allowing us to repurchase up to 283,000 shares of our common stock from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions. The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will
depend on market conditions, applicable SEC rules and various other factors.    During the year ended December 31, 2015, 42,000 shares of common stock
were repurchased at an average cost of $14.60.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a total of 226,300 shares of common stock were
repurchased at an average cost of $15.31.    In October and November 2016, a total of 3,500 shares of common stock were repurchased at an average cost of
$15.45.     NOTE 13   STOCK BASED COMPENSATION   
 Melrose Bancorp, Inc. adopted the Melrose Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2015 Equity Incentive Plan ) to provide directors, officers,
and employees of the Company and Melrose Cooperative Bank with additional incentives to promote growth and performance of the Company and Melrose Cooperative Bank. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the issuance or delivery to participants of
up to 396,140 shares of Melrose Bancorp, Inc. common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units. Of this number, the maximum number of shares of Melrose Bancorp, Inc.
common stock that may be issued under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options is 282,957 shares, and the maximum number of shares of Melrose Bancorp, Inc. common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or
restricted stock units is 113,183 shares. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan was effective upon approval by stockholders at the November 23, 2015 annual meeting.  
 On May 12, 2016, the Company issued 44,300 shares of common stock restricted stock awards. The restricted stock award expense is based on $15.13 per
share, and shares vest over 5 years commencing one year from the grant date. During the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 the expense was $31,000 and $56,000, respectively. The recognized tax benefit was $11,000 and
$19,000, respectively.    On May 12, 2016, the Company granted 224,200 stock options. The stock options have an exercise price of $15.13 per share, and
vest ratably over 5 years commencing one year from the date of the grant. The stock option expense is equal to the number of options expected to vest each year times the grant date fair value of the shares as determined using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The Company completed an analysis of seven peer banks to determine the expected volatility of 20.24%. The exercise price used in the pricing model was $15.13, the closing price of the stock on the grant date. The expected life
was estimated to be 6.5 years and the 7 year treasury rate of 1.54% was used as the annual risk free interest rate. Using these variables, the estimated fair value is $3.71 per share. During the three and nine month periods ending September 30,
2016 the stock option expense was $42,000 and $64,000, respectively. The recognized tax benefit was $16,000 and $22,000, respectively.    At
September 30, 2016 the unrecognized share based compensation expense related to the 44,300 unvested restricted stock awards amounted to $614,000. The unrecognized expense will be recognized over a weighted average life of 4.6 years.  
 At September 30, 2016, none of the 224,200 stock options outstanding are exercisable, and the remaining contractual life is 9.6 years. The unrecognized
expense related to the unvested options is $768,000, and will be recognized over a weighted average life of 4.6 years.

   Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015   
 Total assets increased $36.0 million, or 15.6%, to $266.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $230.7 million at December 31, 2015. The
increase was primarily the result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents and net loans, partially offset by a decrease in available-for-sale securities.  
 Cash and cash equivalents increased $3.4 million, or 19.9%, to $20.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $16.9 million at
December 31, 2015. This increase was due primarily from proceeds from sales, maturities, and calls of available-for-sale securities, and an increase in deposits.  
 Securities available-for-sale decreased $13.0 million, or 28.9%, to $32.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $45.1 million at
December 31, 2015. The decrease in securities available-for-sale during the period was mostly a result of sales, maturities, and calls of available-for-sale securities.  
 Net loans increased $45.2 million, or 28.2%, to $205.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $160.3 million at December 31, 2015. The
increase in net loans was due primarily to an increase of $29.9 million, or 22.6%, in one-to four-family residential loans, an increase of $8.5 million, or 64.4%, in commercial real estate loans, and an increase of $7.3 million, or 171.3%, in
construction loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in one-to four-family residential loans was partly due to the increase in loans purchased. The increase in commercial real estate loans was partly due to a $2.8
million participation loan.    At September 30, 2016 our investment in bank-owned life insurance was $5.3 million, an increase of
$107,000, or 2%, from $5.2 million at December 31, 2015. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding offset for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that
is non-taxable.    Total deposits increased $33.4 million, or 18.1%, to $217.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $184.5 million at
December 31, 2015. The increase in deposits was due primarily to an increase of $29.8 million, or 34.1%, in time deposits, an increase of $1.7 million, or 5.1%, in money market accounts, and an increase of $6.0 million, or 46.4%, in demand
deposits. The increases in time deposits, money markets, and demand deposits were offset by a decrease of $4.6 million, or 26.6%, in NOW accounts. The increase in time deposits was a result of special promotions, as well as, offering listed
certificates of deposit through QwickRate. QwickRate is an unbiased online marketplace for CD buyers and sellers. The bank utilizes this national CD market as a source of time certificates of deposits. Depositors in this market are institutional,
non-consumer entities such as credit unions, banking institutions, public entities, CD brokers and some private corporations or non-profit organizations.  
 Borrowings increased to $5.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $0 at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, we had the
ability to borrow approximately an additional $104.9 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, subject to certain collateral requirements. Additionally at September 30, 2016, we had the ability to borrow up to $5.0 million on a Federal
Funds line of credit with the Co-operative Central Bank.    Total stockholders  equity decreased $2.3 million, or 5.0%, to $43.2
million at September 30, 2016 from $45.5 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of Company common stock totaling $3.5 million, partially offset by net income of $853,000 and other comprehensive income
of $136,000.

   Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
   General.   Net income increased $180,000, or 87.4%, to $386,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $206,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net income increased primarily due to gains on sales of available-for-sale securities, and an increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, noninterest expense
and income tax expense.      Interest and Dividend Income.   Interest and dividend income increased $402,000, or 26.3%, to $1.9
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to an increase in interest and fees on loans, which increased $448,000, or 34.8%, to $1.7 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest and fees on loans was primarily the result of an increase in new loan originations.  
 Interest and dividends on securities decreased $52,000, or 22.5%, to $179,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $231,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulting primarily from a decrease in the average balance of available-for-sale securities of $12.1 million, or 26.6%, to $33.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $45.5
million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.    Other interest income increased $6,000, or 85.7%, to $13,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from $7,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to changes in interest rates. There was an increase of $1.7 million in the average balance of other interest earning assets quarter to
quarter.      Interest Expense.   Interest expense increased $103,000, or 31.6%, to $429,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $326,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $37.9 million, or 24.0%, in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits.  
   Net Interest and Dividend Income.   Net interest and dividend income increased $299,000, or 24.9%, to $1.5 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the net interest margin of 13 basis points to 2.40% for 2016 from 2.27% for 2015. This was offset in part by a
decrease in net interest-earning assets of $169,000, or 0.3%, to $53.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $53.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Provision for Loan Losses.   We recorded a provision for loan losses of $117,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2016, an increase of $82,000 from the provision of $35,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to an increase in total loans of $17.7 million, or 9.4%, to $206.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $188.3
million at June 30, 2016. The increase in total loans was due primarily to an increase of $15.8 million, or 10.8%, in one-to four-family residential loans, an increase of $2.7 million, or 14.4%, in commercial real estate loans, partially offset
by a decrease of $370,000, or 3.1%, in construction loans during the three months ended September 30, 2016.    There were no
charge-offs for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. The allowance for loan losses was $859,000 or 0.42% of total loans, at September 30, 2016, an increase of $294,000, or 52.0%, compared to $565,000, or 0.40%
of total loans, at September 30, 2015. There were no nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016 compared to $285,000 at September 30, 2015.  
   Noninterest Income.   Noninterest income increased $220,000, or 211.5%, to $324,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2016 from $104,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to an increase in the gain on sales of available-for-sale securities, net to $279,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $0 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in other income of $54,000, or 96.4%, to $2,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $56,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
   There were no loans originated for sale and sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Fees
and service charges decreased $4,000, or 16.0%, to $21,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $25,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest expense increased $126,000, or 12.9%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 from $973,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to an increase to salary and employee benefits, audits and examination expenses and data processing expenses.

   Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   
   General.   Net income increased $350,000, or 69.6%, to $853,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $503,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net income increased primarily due to an increase in net interest and dividend income and noninterest income, offset by an increase in noninterest expense, and income tax expense.  
   Interest and Dividend Income.   Interest and dividend income increased $1.1 million, or 25.6%, to $5.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from $4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on loans, which increased $1.1 million, or 30.3%, to $4.7 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest and fees on loans was the result of an increase in new loan originations and an increase in the yield on loans.  
 Interest and dividends on securities decreased $12,000, or 1.9%, to $631,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $643,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulting primarily from a decrease of $5.9 million, or 13.2%, in the average balance on securities to $38.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $44.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, offset by an increase in the yield on securities of 0.25%, from 1.93% to 2.18%.      Interest
Expense.   Interest expense increased $243,000, or 25.8%, to $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $943,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $31.2
million, or 20.1%, in the average balance on interest-bearing deposits to $186.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $155.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Net Interest and Dividend Income.   Net interest and dividend income increased $864,000, or 25.6%, to $4.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to our net interest margin increase of 20 basis points. This was offset in part as our net interest-earning assets decreased
$533,000, or 1.0%, to $52.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $52.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Provision for Loan Losses.   We recorded a $279,000 provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
compared to $45,000 recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to an increase in total loans of $45.2 million, or 28.1%, to $206.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $160.8 million at December 31,
2015. The increase in total loans was due primarily to an increase of $29.9 million, or 22.6%, in one-to four-family residential loans, an increase of $8.5 million, or 64.4%, in commercial real estate loans, and an increase of $7.4 million, or
171.3%, in construction loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    There were no charge-offs for the nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The allowance for loan losses was $859,000 or 0.40% of total loans, at September 30, 2016, an increase of $294,000, or 52.0%, compared to $565,000, or 0.40% of total loans, at September 30, 2015.
There were no nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016 compared to $285,000 at September 30, 2015.      Noninterest
Income.   Noninterest income increased $481,000, or 213.8%, to $706,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $225,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase is primarily due to gains on sales of
available-for-sale securities, net of $572,000 in 2016 as compared to a gain, net of writedowns of $32,000 in 2015, resulting in an increase in 2016 of $540,000. We recorded $572,000 and $409,000 in gains on sales of available-for-sale securities
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were no writedowns of available-for-sale securities recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $377,000 in writedowns of available-for-sale
securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in other income of $51,000, or 85.0%, to $9,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $60,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. There were no loans originated for sale and sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      
   Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest expense increased $551,000, or 19.6%, to $3.4 million, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $2.8 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Noninterest expense increased primarily due to increases to salaries and employee benefits as well as data processing, audit and examination expenses, and
the expense for professional services.  
      25  

Table of Contents  

  Salaries and employee benefit expense increased $294,000, or 16.5%, to $2.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of hiring additional staff as well as normal salary increases and increases in payroll taxes. Additionally, stock based compensation
expense, including ESOP expense, was $205,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $80,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The expense for professional services increased $191,000, or 219.5%, to
$278,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 from $87,000 for the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to increases in legal and consulting fees related to stock based compensation and the use of additional
consulting services in the loan department and other areas. Data processing expenses increased $34,000, or 14.5%, to $269,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $235,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Audits
and examination expenses increased $26,000, or 19.0%, to $163,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $137,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     Income Tax Expense.     Income tax expense increased $210,000, or 88.2%, to $448,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $238,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was 34.4% and 32.1%, respectively.    
   Average Balances and Yields.   The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain
other information for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited). All average balances are daily average balances based upon amortized costs. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average
