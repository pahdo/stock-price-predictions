 GENERAL  
   
 We intend to commence operations in the business of graphic design. Our primary services are aimed at medium-sized businesses and planned to be as follows: creating, producing, redesigning and delivering graphic works of various kinds on customer demand. By graphic works it is implied: personal or corporate logos, brand logos, brand identities, redesign of existing logos or designing logos based on customer s sketches; designing, creating, customizing, producing of corporate brand books, art posters, advertising posters, event posters; creating illustrations, infographics, information posters; creating, designing or re-designing corporate fonts, brand fonts, packages; design prints to be used on most sorts of outwear. Due to customer demand or business growth, a few changes in the business might occur to meet the requirements of the customers or on the account of the niche the Company plans to take. 
   
 As we plan to provide online graphic design services we keep in mind to provide our service around the world. We plan to start our sales primarily in Germany. The final product of the graphic design service is a multimedia file(s) which possible to download to any secured cloud-based server or secured customer's FTP server. It makes the business convenient for worldwide operation through the Internet. We intend to use online and phone communications with our potential customers to deliver a graphic design service. We believe that our key marketing strategy is likely to be online marketing and direct sales. We intend to focus our marketing campaign on the Internet as an option to promote our service worldwide and intend to use English version website as primary version. We plan to develop multilingual website for our graphic design service proposal.   
   
 Our principal office address is located at Landhausstrasse, 228, Stuttgart, Germany 70178.  
   
  Business Concept  
   
 The Company s primary goal is to design logos, identities, posters, customize or redesign existing works to meet the expectations of the customers. As business might expand into related markets, our customers might be able to apply for custom designs of their corporate stationery or a website as well. For our potential clients comfort, we think of establishing an online webstore with ready-to-use works, such as logos. In case of ordering a new work or demanding customization of existing ones, the customer will be provided with a form to fill in, in order to clarify the details of work to be done (what colors or fonts are to be used, Company s motto etc.) 
   
 Thus, customers are likely to be provided with the following:  
   
 1) a webstore - to order ready-made logos, posters and other works; 
 2) a set of packages the customers may chose from -  basic, extended, premium (with its own features each); 
 3) market research of the industry and competitors; 
   
  Clients  
   
 Our services are aimed at medium-sized enterprises who would like to stand out among their competitors with their unique logo or brand identity, as well as at individuals who desire to obtain some sort of graphic work of their own.  On the account of appropriate registration, we will provide our services to our potential clients who, presumably, fall under the description:  
   
 1) medium-sized or small business competing to stand out in a row of similar services; 
 2) business that lacks corporate or brand identity or businesses going through rebranding; 
 3) on-line services (shops, video and music streaming services, online gaming services etc.) that needs web design or icons matching their services or identity. 
 4) well-known companies that needs a product logo or a product concept;

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS  
   
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.  Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements.  Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.  Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
   
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
   
 We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 
   
 We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. 
   
 Our net loss for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 was $13,024 compared to a net loss of $612 during the period from Inception (October 26, 2014) to August 31, 2015. During fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 we have generated $7,800 in revenue. For the period from Inception (October 26, 2014) to August 31, 2015, we have not generated any revenues. 
   
 During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, we incurred expenses of $20,824 compared to $612 incurred during the period from Inception (October 26, 2014) to August 31, 2015.   
   
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
 As of August 31, 2016 our current assets were $20,389 compared to $7,013 in current assets at August 31, 2015. As of August 31, 2016, our current liabilities were $1,625 compared to $625 in current liabilities at August 31, 2015.  
   
 Stockholders  equity increased from $6,388 as of August 31, 2015 to $18,764 as of August 31, 2016.  
   
 The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 8,046,027 for the year ended August 31, 2016 compared to 1,404,531 for the period from Inception (October 26, 2014) to August 31, 2015. 

6  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $13,024. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $612 for the period from inception (October 26, 2014) to August 31, 2015. 
   
  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  
   
 We have financed our operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the year ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows from financing activities was $26,400 received from proceeds from issuance of common stock and loans from a director. For the period from inception (October 26, 2014) to August 31, 2015, net cash flows from financing activities was $7,625 received from proceeds from issuance of common stock and advance from director. 
   
 PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 
   
 We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 
   
 Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business and (ii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

7  

MATERIAL COMMITMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments. 
   
 PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT 
   
 We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
   
 As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
 GOING CONCERN 
   
 The independent auditors' report accompanying our August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  
   
  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
   
  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of  
  Spelt Group Corp.  
   
  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Spelt Group Corp. as of August 31, 2016, and the related statements of operations, stockholders  deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended August 31, 2016. Spelt Group Corp. s management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The financial statements of Spelt Group Corp. as of August 31, 2015, and for the period from October 26, 2014 (inception) to August 31, 2015, were audited by other auditors whose report dated October 21, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.  
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Spelt Group Corp. as of August 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended August 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
  We were not engaged to examine management s assertion about the effectiveness of Spelt Group Corp. s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 included in the accompanying report and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon.  
  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Spelt Group Corp. will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, these conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
  (Audited)  
   
  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
   
 SPELT GROUP CORP. (the  Company ) is a corporation established under the laws in the State of Nevada on October 26, 2014.  
 Since inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new graphic design business.  The Company has generated revenue and expenses from the limited efforts to date.   
 The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the Company s business plan. 
   
  Basis of Presentation   
 The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 
   
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management s estimates and assumptions. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At August 31, 2016 the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts. 

14  

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share  
   
 Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  
  Revenue Recognition  
   
 The Company follows the guidance of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. We record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been provided, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. 
   
  New Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows. 
   
  Subsequent Events  
   
 The Company has evaluated all transactions from August 31, 2016 through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration. 
   
  NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN  
 The Company s financial statements as of August 31, 2016 been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not raised sufficient funds to execute its business plans and has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (October 26, 2014) to August 31, 2016 of $13,636. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.   

15  

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 4   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
 As of August 31, 2016, the Company s sole officer and director loaned the Company $1,625 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  . The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. 
   
  NOTE 5   INCOME TAX  
 As of August 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $13,636 that may be available to reduce future years  taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
 An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year August 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
