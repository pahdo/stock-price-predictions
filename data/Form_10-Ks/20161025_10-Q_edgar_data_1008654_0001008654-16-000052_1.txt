  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited)  

Note 1: 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
     Basis of Presentation:   The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tupperware Brands Corporation and its subsidiaries, collectively  Tupperware  or the  Company , with all intercompany transactions and balances having been eliminated. These condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited   2015   financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 26, 2015  .  
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.  
  These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared following the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and, in the Company's opinion, reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring items that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the balance sheet, statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations. Operating results of any interim period presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full fiscal year. 
  The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of December. As a result, the 2016 fiscal year will include 53 weeks, as compared with 52 weeks for fiscal 2015, and the fourth quarter of 2016 will include 14 weeks. 
  Use of Estimates:   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.  
   
           Note 2: 
    Shipping and Handling Costs  
     The cost of products sold line item includes costs related to the purchase and manufacture of goods sold by the Company. Among these costs are inbound freight charges, duties, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, depreciation expense, internal transfer costs and warehousing costs of raw material, work in process and packing materials. The warehousing and distribution costs of finished goods are included in delivery, sales and administrative expense ( DS A ). Distribution costs are comprised of outbound freight and associated labor costs. Fees billed to customers associated with the distribution of products are classified as revenue. The distribution costs included in DS A expense for the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015   were   $32.6 million   and   $32.7 million  , respectively, and for the year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were   $99.1 million   and   $103.2 million  , respectively. 
   
           Note 3: 
    Promotional Costs  
     The Company frequently makes promotional offers to members of its independent sales force to encourage them to fulfill specific goals or targets for sales levels, party attendance, addition of new sales force members or other business-critical functions. The awards offered are in the form of product awards, special prizes or trips. 
  The Company accrues for the costs of these awards during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award and reports these costs primarily as a component of DS A expense. These accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards, based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred. During the qualification period, actual results are monitored, and changes to the original estimates are made when known. Promotional and other sales force compensation expenses included in DS A expense totaled   $89.5 million   and   $88.2 million   for the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $281.2 million   and   $288.0 million   for the year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively.

    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 

Pretax amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss that related to cash flow hedges consisted of net   gain  s of   $4.3 million   and   $14.1 million   for the year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. Associated with these items were tax   provision  s of   $1.2 million   and   $3.3 million  , respectively. See   Note 11   for further discussion of derivatives. 
  For the year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , pretax amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss related to pension and other post-retirement items consisted of prior service   benefit  s of   $1.1 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively, pension settlement costs of   $1.5 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, and actuarial   losses   of   $1.3 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively.

Note 7:  
    Re-engineering and Impairment Costs 
     The Company recorded   $2.4 million   and   $0.3 million   in re-engineering charges during the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $5.4 million   and   $4.5 million   for the year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively.  
  In both years, these charges were primarily related to severance costs incurred for headcount reductions in several of the Company s operations in connection with changes in its management and organizational structures. 
  The balances included in accrued liabilities related to re-engineering and impairment charges as of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015   were as follows: 

The accrual balance as of   September 24, 2016  , related primarily to severance payments to be made by the end of the   2016  . 
  Included in the re-engineering and impairment caption on the Company's consolidated statement of income in the year-to-date period of   2015   was   $13.5 million   in long-term fixed asset impairments in Venezuela. 
   
           Note 8:  
    Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
     The Company's goodwill and intangible assets relate primarily to the December 2005 acquisition of the direct-to-consumer businesses of Sara Lee Corporation.  
  In the     third     quarters of     2016   and   2015  , the Company completed the annual assessments for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, concluding there were   no   impairments. The Company only considers the goodwill balances of   $77 million   and   $28 million   associated with the Fuller Mexico and NaturCare Japan reporting units, respectively, to be significant relative to total equity. 
  These assessments included a step 1 impairment evaluation for the goodwill associated with the Fuller Mexico reporting unit as prescribed under ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. The fair value analysis for Fuller Mexico was completed using a combination of the income and market approach with a   75 percent     weighting on the income approach. The significant assumptions used in the income approach included estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows, including projections of revenue, costs, utilization of assets and capital requirements. The income approach, or discounted cash flow approach, also requires an estimate as to the appropriate discount rate to be used for each entity. The most sensitive estimate in this valuation is the projection of operating cash flows, as these provide the basis for the estimate of fair market value. The Company s cash flow model used a forecast period of   10 years   and a terminal value. The growth rates were determined by reviewing historical results of the operating unit and the historical results of the Company s other similar business units, along with the expected contribution from growth strategies being implemented. The market approach relies on an analysis of publicly-traded companies similar to Tupperware and deriving a range of revenue and profit multiples. The publicly-traded companies used in the market approach were selected based on their having similar product lines of consumer goods, beauty products and/or companies using a direct-to-consumer distribution method. The resulting multiples were then applied to the reporting unit to determine fair value.    
  The significant assumptions for the Fuller Mexico step 1 analysis included annual revenue growth rates ranging from   1 percent     to   5 percent     with an average growth rate of     4 percent  , including a     3 percent     growth rate used in calculating the terminal value. The discount rate used for Fuller Mexico was     14.8 percent  .

  TUPPERWARE BRANDS CORPORATION  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited)  

The amount by which the estimated fair value of the Fuller Mexico reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, at     20 percent  ,   was more in the third quarter of     2016   than in the     2015     assessment, primarily due to an increase in the estimated fair market value in connection with improved market pricing metrics and other observable market conditions, as well as a lower carrying value in 2016, reflecting the amortization of the definite-lived Fuller tradename  . Though the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value in the annual assessment, a smaller sales force size and/or operating performance significantly below current expectations, including changes in projected future revenue, profitability and cash flow, as well as higher working capital, interest rates or cost of capital, could have a negative effect on the fair value of the reporting unit and therefore reduce the fair value below the carrying value. This could result in recording an impairment charge to the goodwill of Fuller Mexico.  
  Also in the third quarter of 2016, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for the goodwill associated with the NaturCare reporting unit and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than its carrying amount. The estimated fair value of the NaturCare reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by   130 percent  , as of September 2015, the date of the reporting unit's most recent step 1 analysis. Based on the Company's evaluation of the assumptions and sensitivities associated with the step 1 analysis for NaturCare, the Company concluded that the fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value as of September 2015. 
  Other than for the Fuller Mexico reporting unit, management has concluded there is no significant foreseeable risk of failing a future step 1 impairment test, nor is there significant foreseeable risk of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets falling below their respective carrying values. Given the sensitivity of fair value valuations to changes in cash flow or market multiples, the Company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to the Company s performance. Actual results below forecasted results or a decrease in the forecasted future results of the Company s business plans or changes in discount rates could also result in an impairment charge, as could changes in market characteristics including declines in valuation multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies. Impairment charges would have an adverse impact on the Company s net income and shareholders' equity.    
   
           Note 9:  
    Segment Information  
     The Company manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of products, primarily through independent direct sales consultants. Certain operating segments have been aggregated based upon consistency of economic substance, geography, products, production process, class of customers and distribution method. 
  Effective from the first quarter of 2016, the Nutrimetics business in France, previously reported in the Asia Pacific segment, is being reported in the Europe segment. Comparable information from prior periods has been reclassified to conform with the new presentation. In full year 2015, Nutrimetics France generated less than one half percent of total sales.    
  The Company's reportable segments include the following:  
                 Europe 
    Primarily design-centric preparation, storage and serving solutions for the kitchen and home through the Tupperware        brand. Europe also includes Avroy Shlain          in South Africa and Nutrimetics        in France, which sell beauty and personal care products. Some units in Asia Pacific also sell beauty and personal care products under the NaturCare       , Nutrimetics        and Fuller        brands. 
      Asia Pacific

Debt Obligations 

____________________ 
     
  Credit Agreement 
  As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company had a weighted average interest rate on outstanding   LIBOR   based borrowings of   1.50 percent   under the Credit Agreement. 
  At   September 24, 2016  , the Company had   $659.3 million   of unused lines of credit, including   $400.9 million   under the committed, secured Credit Agreement, and   $258.4 million   available under various uncommitted lines around the world.  
  The Credit Agreement has customary financial covenants related to interest coverage and leverage. These restrictions are not expected to impact the Company's operations. As of   September 24, 2016  , and currently, the Company had considerable cushion under its financial covenants. 
   
           Note 11: 
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  
     The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of its international operations. Although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the Company's local manufacturing in many markets, a strengthening U.S. dollar generally has a negative impact on the Company. In response to these fluctuations, the Company uses financial instruments to hedge certain of its exposures and to manage the foreign exchange impact to its financial statements. At its inception, a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value, cash flow or net equity hedge.  
  Fair value hedges are entered into with financial instruments such as forward contracts, with the objective of limiting exposure to certain foreign exchange risks primarily associated with accounts payable and non-permanent intercompany transactions. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings. In assessing hedge effectiveness, the Company excludes forward points, which are considered to be a component of interest expense. The forward points on fair value hedges resulted in pretax gains of   $3.4 million   and   $2.6 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $11.2 million   and   $9.0 million   for the respective year-to-date periods. 
  The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures resulting from certain forecasted purchases and classifies these as cash flow hedges. At initiation, the Company's cash flow hedge contracts are generally for periods ranging from   one   to   fifteen months  . The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings as the transactions being hedged are recorded. As such, the balance at the end of the current reporting period in other comprehensive income, related to cash flow hedges, will generally be reclassified into earnings within the next   twelve months  . The associated asset or liability on the open hedges is recorded in other current assets or accrued liabilities, as applicable. In assessing hedge effectiveness, the Company excludes forward points, which are included as a component of interest expense.

The Company also uses financial instruments, such as forward contracts and certain euro denominated borrowings under the Company's Credit Agreement, to hedge a portion of its net equity investment in international operations and classifies these as net equity hedges. Changes in the value of these financial instruments, excluding any ineffective portion of the hedges, are included in foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive loss  .   The Company recorded, net of tax, in other comprehensive income a net gain of   $6.5 million   and   $9.9 million   associated with these hedges in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of   2016  , respectively, and a net gain of   $27.7 million   and   $54.1 million   associated with such hedges for the respective periods of   2015  . Due to the permanent nature of the investments, the Company does not anticipate reclassifying any portion of these amounts to the income statement in the next twelve months. In assessing hedge effectiveness, the Company excludes forward points, which are included as a component of interest expense. 
  While the forward contracts used for net equity and fair value hedges of non-permanent intercompany balances mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses, they result in an impact to operating cash flows as they are settled, whereas the hedged items do not generate offsetting cash flows. The net cash flow impact of these currency hedges for the year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were   outflow  s of   $5.6 million   and   $21.1 million  , respectively. 
  The Company considers the total notional value of its forward contracts as the best measure of the volume of derivative transactions. As of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  , the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts to purchase currencies were   $118.1 million   and   $141.9 million  , respectively, and the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts to sell currencies were   $118.1 million   and   $137.4 million  , respectively. As of   September 24, 2016  , the notional values of the largest positions outstanding were to purchase euro   $108.4 million   and to sell   Indonesian rupiah     $21.7 million  . 
  The following table summarizes the Company's derivative positions, which are the only assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and the impact they had on the Company's financial position as of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  . Fair values were determined based on third party quotations (Level 2 fair value measurement):

Note 12: 
    Fair Value Measurements  
     Due to their short maturities or their insignificance, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and short-term borrowings approximated their fair values at   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  . The Company estimates that, based on current market conditions, the value of its   4.75%  , 2021 senior notes was   $651.3 million   at   September 24, 2016  , compared with the carrying value of   $599.4 million  . The higher fair value resulted from changes, since issuance, in the corporate debt markets and investor preferences. The fair value of debt is classified as a Level 2 liability, and is estimated using quoted market prices as provided in secondary markets that consider the Company's credit risk and market related conditions. See   Note 11   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the Company's derivative instruments and related fair value measurements. 
   
           Note 13:  
    Retirement Benefit Plans  
     Components of net periodic benefit cost for the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were as follows: 

During the year-to-date periods ending   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , approximately   $1.7 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively, of pretax expenses were reclassified from other comprehensive income to a component of net periodic benefit cost. As they relate to non-U.S. plans, the Company uses current exchange rates to make these reclassifications. The impact of exchange rate fluctuations is included on the net amortization line of the table above. 
   
   The effective tax rates   for the     third   quarter and year-to-date periods of   2016   were   38.4 percent   and   30.4 percent   compared with     28.5 percent   and   28.4 percent  , respectively,   for the comparable   2015   periods. The   2016     rates were higher primarily due to a gain from the land transactions near the Company's headquarters during the third quarter, which was subject to an effective U.S. federal and state tax rate of     38.5 percent  .   The 2016 year-to-date effective tax rate is below the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to lower foreign effective tax rates.    
  As of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  , the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefit was   $20.7 million   and   $21.8 million  , respectively. The Company estimates that as of September 24, 2016, approximately   $19.2 million   of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the Company's global operations are recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties were   $6.8 million   and   $6.0 million   as of the periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015  .

The Company estimates that it may settle one or more foreign audits in the next twelve months that may result in a decrease in the amount of accrual for uncertain tax positions of up to   $1.0 million  . For the remaining balance as of   September 24, 2016  , the Company is not able to reliably estimate the timing or ultimate settlement amount. While the Company does not currently expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to the uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease related to audits in various foreign jurisdictions that may conclude during that period or new developments that could also, in turn, impact the Company's assessment relative to the establishment of valuation allowances against certain existing deferred tax assets. These valuation allowances relate to tax assets in jurisdictions where it is management's best estimate that there is not a greater than 50 percent probability that the benefit of the assets will be realized in the associated tax returns. The likelihood of realizing the benefit of deferred tax assets is assessed on an ongoing basis. This assessment requires estimates as to future operating results, as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's tax planning strategies. At this time, the Company is not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. 
   
           Note 15: 
    Statement of Cash Flow Supplemental Disclosure  
     Under the Company's stock incentive programs, employees are allowed to use shares retained by the Company to satisfy minimum statutorily required withholding taxes in certain jurisdictions. In the year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  ,   21,189   and   12,847   shares, respectively, were retained to fund withholding taxes, with values totaling   $1.1 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively, which were included as stock repurchases in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

     Stock option activity for   2016   is summarized in the following table:  

The intrinsic value of options exercised totaled   $0.2 million   and   $4.7 million   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.9 million   and   $7.3 million   in the respective year-to-date periods. 
  The Company also has time-vested, performance-vested and market-vested share awards. The activity for such awards in   2016   is summarized in the following table:  

Compensation expense related to the Company's stock based compensation for the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were as follows: 

As of   September 24, 2016  , total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to all stock based awards was   $20.9 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.7 years  .

    Guarantor Information  
     The Company's payment obligations under its senior notes due in 2021 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior secured basis, by Dart Industries Inc. (the "Guarantor"). The guarantee is secured by certain "Tupperware" trademarks and service marks owned by the Guarantor.  
  Condensed consolidated financial information as of   September 24, 2016   and   December 26, 2015   and for the quarter-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   for Tupperware Brands Corporation (the "Parent"), the Guarantor and all other subsidiaries (the "Non-Guarantors") is as follows.  
  Each entity in the consolidating financial information follows the same accounting policies as described in the consolidated financial statements, except for the use by the Parent and Guarantor of the equity method of accounting to reflect ownership interests in subsidiaries that are eliminated upon consolidation. The Guarantor is   100%   owned by the Parent, and there are certain entities within the Non-Guarantors classification that the Parent owns directly. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of either the Parent or the Guarantor to obtain adequate funds from their respective subsidiaries by dividend or loan that should interfere with their ability to meet their operating needs or debt repayment obligations.

Note 19: 
    New Accounting Pronouncements  
     In August 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to existing guidance on presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the Statement of Cash Flows. This guidance is intended to reduce diversity in the classification of transactions related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, zero-coupon debt instruments settlement, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, insurance claims settlement and corporate-owned life insurance settlement, distributions from equity method investments and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of this amendment to have an impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an amendment to existing guidance regarding revenue from contracts with customers. The amendment outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The August 2015 amendment also allows early adoption of the revenue standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. In March and April 2016, the FASB issued amendments to provide clarification on implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued amendments to provide clarification on assessment of collectibility criteria, presentation of sales taxes and measurement of noncash consideration. In addition, the amendment provided clarification and included simplification to transition guidance on contract modifications and completed contracts at transition. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this amendment on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to existing guidance regarding employee share-based payments. Under the amendment, all excess tax benefits and tax deficits will be recognized in the income statement. Regardless of the impact on taxes payable, the tax benefits will be recognized in the current period and excess tax benefits will be classified as an element of cash flow operating activities. In addition, the amendment included simplification to existing guidance on forfeitures, intrinsic value and the withholding of shares for participants' personal income taxes. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. There will be an impact of adopting this standard on the consolidated financial statements that likely will lead to increased volatility of the Company's tax rate that will be dependent on the timing and intrinsic value of future share-based compensation award exercises. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to existing guidance on lease accounting that requires the assets and liabilities arising from operating leases be presented in the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this amendment on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 2. 
    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
      
  The following is a discussion of the results of operations for the   13   and   39 weeks ended     September 24, 2016  , compared with the   13   and   39 weeks ended     September 26, 2015  , and changes in financial condition during the   39 weeks ended     September 24, 2016  .   The Company's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of December. As a result, the 2016 fiscal year will include 53 weeks, as compared with 52 weeks for fiscal 2015, and the fourth quarter of 2016 will include 14 weeks.    
  The Company's primary means of distributing its products is through independent sales organizations and individuals, which in many cases are also its customers. The vast majority of the Company's products are, in turn, sold to end customers who are not members of its sales force. The Company is largely dependent upon these independent sales organizations and individuals to reach end consumers, and any significant disruption of this distribution network would have a negative financial impact on the Company and its ability to generate sales, earnings and operating cash flows. The Company's primary business drivers are the size, activity, diversity and productivity of its independent sales organizations. 
  As the impacts of foreign currency translation are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, the Company believes the presentation of results on a local currency basis, as a supplement to reported results, helps improve readers' ability to understand the Company's operating results and evaluate performance in comparison with prior periods. The Company presents local currency information that compares results between periods as if current period exchange rates had been used to translate results in the prior period. The Company uses results on a local currency basis as one measure to evaluate performance. The Company generally refers to such amounts as calculated on a "local currency" basis, or "excluding the impact of foreign currency." These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Results on a local currency basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.  
  Effective from the first quarter of 2016, the Nutrimetics business in France, previously reported in the Asia Pacific segment, is being reported in the Europe segment. Comparable information from prior periods has been reclassified to conform with the new presentation. In full year 2015, Nutrimetics France generated less than one half percent of total sales.

Reported sales were even compared with the   third   quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales   increased     2 percent  . The Company defines established market economies as those in Western Europe (including Scandinavia), Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. All other countries are classified as having emerging market economies. The Company's businesses operating in emerging market economies had a   5 percent     increase   in local currency sales, primarily in the Tupperware North America and South America segments. Local currency sales in the Company's businesses that operate in established economy markets, as a group,   decreased     5 percent   compared with   2015  . 
  Operating and net income   increased     48 percent   and   35 percent  , respectively, in the   third   quarter. Excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, operating and net income   increased     51 percent   and   39 percent  , respectively, primarily reflecting   $22.2 million higher pretax gains from land transactions   and increased segment profit in Asia Pacific, Tupperware North America and South America, including $1.7 million lower   impact related to bolivar denominated assets in connection with the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar  , and from lower unallocated corporate costs. These were partially offset by lower segment profit in Beauty North America and Europe.  
  Reported sales for the year-to-date period   decreased     5   percent. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales   increased     2   percent. The Company's emerging markets   increased     5 percent   in local currency sales, while local currency sales in the established markets   decreased     4 percent  . Net income for the year to date period primarily reflects $11.7 million more in pretax income from land transactions and increased segment profit in Asia Pacific, Tupperware North America and South America. This was partially offset by lower segment profit in Beauty North America and Europe. Also impacting the comparison, was a   $13.5 million   impairment of long-term fixed assets in Venezuela during the first quarter 2015. The impact related to bolivar denominated assets in connection with the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in the year-to-date periods of 2016 and 2015 was   $4.2 million and $13.1 million  , respectively. 
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities for the periods ending   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was   $92.3 million   and   $72.2 million  , respectively.   The favorable comparison primarily reflected a lower cash outflow than in 2015 from the Company's hedging activities, lower cash tax payments, and better management of inventory. The net impact of these items was partially offset by an increase in outflows of cash related to other net working capital items, particularly payables due to the timing of payments at year-end.

Net Sales 
  Reported sales were even in the   third   quarter. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales   increased     2 percent  . The average impact of higher prices was 3 percent. 
  The Company's emerging market units accounted for   71 percent   and   70 percent   of the Company's reported sales in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Reported sales in these units increased   $6.2 million  , or   2 percent  , which included a   negative     $11.5 million   impact from   weaker   foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the sales of these units increased   5 percent   most significantly in Argentina, related to inflationary driven pricing, along with some increased volume, in Brazil, due to a larger, more active sales force, in China, from growth in the number of experience studios (physical selling locations) and higher productivity including from digital marketing initiatives, in Tupperware Mexico and Tupperware South Africa from larger sales forces. The sales growth in these units was partially offset by a decrease in Egypt from curtailed shipments in light of currency controls, in Fuller Mexico from a smaller sales force, and in Indonesia and Turkey from smaller, less active sales forces. The average impact of higher prices in the emerging market units was 4 percent. 
  Reported sales in the established market units   decreased     $5.4 million  , or   3 percent  . Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales in these units were down   5 percent  . Among these units, the most significant local currency decreases were in Austria from a less active and productive sales force, in Australia/New Zealand from a less active sales force, in BeautiControl, due to a less productive sales force, and in Scandinavia from a less active and productive sales force. The average price increase in the established market units was 1 percent. 
  On a year-to-date basis, emerging markets accounted for   67   percent and   68   percent of total Company sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total sales on a reported basis in the emerging markets decreased   $60.3 million  , including a negative   $112.6 million   impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales increased in these units by   5   percent. Total sales for the established markets decreased   $19.2 million  , or   4   percent, for the year-to-date period of 2016, compared with the same period of 2015, which included a negative   $0.4 million   impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The sources of the year-to-date fluctuations largely followed those of the third quarter comparison except for a larger impact on the comparison from the sales decrease in France for the year-to-date period. 
  A more detailed discussion of the sales results by reporting segment is included in the segment results section below.  
  As discussed in   Note 3   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company includes promotional costs in delivery, sales and administrative expense (DS A). As a result, the Company's net sales may not be comparable with other companies that treat these costs as a reduction of revenue. 
  Gross Margin 
  Gross margin as a percentage of sales was   67.7 percent   and   66.9 percent   in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase of   0.8   percentage points ("pp") primarily reflected a favorable mix of products sold (0.4 pp) and lower manufacturing costs (0.2 pp), as well as less of an impact than last year of inventory in Venezuela being included in cost of goods sold at the stronger, historical exchange rate when it was procured and produced rather than the rate used to translate sales in the quarter (0.1 pp). This was partially offset by higher resin costs (0.1 pp).  
  For the year-to-date periods, gross margin as a percentage of sales was   67.9 percent   in 2016, compared with   67.3 percent   for the same period of 2015. The factors leading to the   0.6   percentage point increase primarily reflected the benefit of mix of products sold (0.4), lower resin costs (0.2 pp) and lower obsolescence expense (0.2 pp). This was partially offset by the mix impact from relatively higher sales in certain units with lower than average gross margins (0.4 pp). 
  As discussed in   Note 2   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company includes costs related to the distribution of its products in DS A. As a result, the Company's gross margin may not be comparable with other companies that include these costs in costs of products sold.

Costs and Expenses 
  DS A as a percentage of sales was   54.5 percent   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with   55.4 percent   in   2015  . The comparison reflected lower unallocated corporate and group costs (0.6 pp), lower promotional costs primarily in Asia Pacific (0.3 pp), and lower marketing costs, mainly in Tupperware North America (0.2 pp), partially offset by a negative impact from the translation effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including the high share of dollar denominated costs as a ratio of sales in light of weaker foreign exchange rates (0.1 pp).  
  For the year-to-date periods, DS A as a percentage of sales increased to   54.0 percent   from   53.9   percent in 2015, primarily reflecting the unfavorable translation effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (0.6 pp). Excluding this impact, the improvement was primarily related to lower unallocated corporate and group costs (0.6 pp) and lower marketing costs mainly in Asia Pacific (0.2 pp). This was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison from lower operating costs in 2015, primarily in Europe (0.3 pp). 
  Specific segment impacts are discussed in the segment results section. 
  Re-engineering Costs 
  Refer to   Note 7   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of re-engineering activities and related accruals. 
  The Company recorded   $2.4 million   and   $0.3 million   in re-engineering charges during the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $5.4 million   and   $4.5 million   for the respective year-to-date periods.   In both years, these charges were primarily related to severance costs incurred for headcount reductions in several of the Company s operations in connection with changes in its management and organizational structures.    
  For the remainder of   2016  , the Company expects to incur approximately $4 million of such costs. 
  Included in the re-engineering and impairment caption on the Company's consolidated statement of income in the year-to-date period of 2015 was   $13.5 million   in long-term fixed asset impairments in Venezuela. 
  Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
  In the     third     quarters of     2016  , the Company completed the annual assessments for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, concluding there were   no   impairments. The Company only considers the goodwill balances of   $77.0 million   and   $28.0 million   associated with the Fuller Mexico and NaturCare Japan reporting units, respectively, to be significant relative to total equity.

These assessments included a step 1 analysis related to Fuller Mexico, for which the significant assumptions included annual revenue increases ranging from   1 percent     to   5 percent     with an average growth rate of     4 percent  , including a     3 percent     growth rate used in calculating the terminal value. The discount rate used for Fuller Mexico was     14.8 percent  .     The amount by which the estimated fair value of the Fuller Mexico reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, at     20 percent  ,   was more in the third quarter of     2016   than in the     2015     assessment, primarily due to an increase in the estimated fair market value in connection with improved market pricing metrics and other observable market conditions, as well as a lower carrying value in 2016, reflecting the amortization of the definite-lived Fuller tradename  . Local currency sales in Fuller Mexico and operating profit have been declining since 2011 at which time the fair value of Fuller Mexico exceeded the carrying value by 77 percent. Since 2011, local currency sales declined 9 percent in 2012, 7 percent in 2013, 3 percent in 2014 and 2 percent in 2015. Local currency sales have declined 7 percent in the 2016 year-to-date period. Over this same time period, operating profit as a percentage of sales declined from the mid teens in 2012 to a low-double digit in 2016. This operating performance, over time, has led to a lower estimated fair value. This lower estimated fair value has been partially offset by lower discount rates and a lower entity carrying value from amortization of the definite-lived Fuller tradename asset, as well as a net asset position that has otherwise, over time, been reduced in light of the smaller scope of the business. Fuller Mexico continues to carry a total sales force size and field manager deficit as of the end of September, despite new programs aimed at higher rates of sales force additions and retention, though productivity is higher. Certain programs in place are aimed at creating a pipeline to identify strong candidates within the sales force who can be trained and motivated for promotion to field manager, a critical component of growth going forward. Despite these factors, the fair value exceeded the carrying value as of the end of the third quarter of 2016. Though the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value in the annual assessment, a smaller sales force size and/or operating performance significantly below current expectations, including changes in projected future revenue, profitability and cash flow, as well as higher working capital, interest rates or cost of capital, could have a negative effect on the fair value of the reporting unit and therefore reduce the fair value below the carrying value. This could result in recording an impairment to the goodwill of Fuller Mexico, including prior to the 2017 annual assessment.  
  Also in the third quarter of 2016, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for the goodwill associated with the NaturCare reporting unit and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than its carrying amount. The estimated fair value of the NaturCare reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by   130 percent  , as of September 2015, the date of the reporting unit's most recent step 1 analysis. Based on the Company's evaluation of the assumptions and sensitivities associated with the step 1 analysis for NaturCare, the Company concluded that the fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value as of September 2015. 
  Other than for the Fuller Mexico reporting unit, management has concluded there is no significant foreseeable risk of failing a future step 1 impairment test, nor is there significant foreseeable risk of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets falling below their respective carrying values. Given the sensitivity of fair value valuations to changes in cash flow or market multiples, the Company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to the Company s performance. Actual results below forecasted results or a decrease in the forecasted future results of the Company s business plans or changes in discount rates could also result in an impairment charge, as could changes in market characteristics including declines in valuation multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies. Impairment charges would have an adverse impact on the Company s net income and shareholders' equity.    
  Gains on Disposal of Assets 
  In 2014 and 2015, the Company entered into two joint ventures with a real estate development partner to develop land near the Company's Orlando headquarters. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded gains of $24.2 million in connection with the sale of the joint ventures. Total cash proceeds from the sale were $30.0 million, including $0.9 million related to the operation of the joint ventures during development. The income from the joint venture operations was recorded in other income on the Company's consolidated statement of income. The joint ventures had been recorded under short-term other assets using the equity method.

Net Interest Expense 
  Net interest expense was   $12.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared with   $10.8 million   in   2015  . In the year-to-date periods, net interest expense was   $33.8 million   in 2016, compared with   $35.1 million   in 2015. The changes in net interest expense in the year-over-year comparisons was primarily due to the timing of recognition of forward points related to the Company's forward currency contracts.  
  Tax Rate 
  The effective tax rates   for the     third   quarter and year-to-date periods of   2016   were   38.4 percent   and   30.4 percent      compared with     28.5 percent   and   28.4 percent  , respectively,   for the comparable   2015   periods. The   2016     rates were higher primarily due to a gain from the land transactions near the Company's headquarters during the third quarter, which was subject to an effective U.S. federal and state tax rate of     38.5 percent  .   The 2016 year-to-date effective tax rate is below the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to lower foreign effective tax rates.    
  As discussed in   Note 14   to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's uncertain tax positions increase the potential for volatility in its tax rate. As such, it is reasonably possible that the effective tax rates in any individual quarter will vary from the full year expectation. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate what impact that may have on any individual quarter. 
  Net Income 
  Reported net income in the   third   quarter of   2016     increased     $12.6 million   compared with   2015  . Compared with   2015  , net income was negatively impacted by   $1.0 million   from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net income   increased     39 percent   in the   third   quarter of 2016, primarily reflecting   $22.2 million higher pretax gains from land transactions   and increased segment profit in Asia Pacific, in Tupperware North America, in South America, and from lower unallocated corporate costs. This was partially offset by lower segment profit in Beauty North America and Europe.  
  Net income for the year-to-date period   increased     $16.9 million   compared with last year, including a negative   $17.9 million   translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The   increase   in net income in local currency primarily reflects $11.7 million from higher pretax gains from land surrounding the Orlando, Florida headquarters and increased segment profit in Asia Pacific from improved gross margins, and in Tupperware North and South America from higher sales volume. 
  International operations generated   91 percent   of sales and   100 percent   of the Company's net segment profit in the   third   quarters and the year to date periods of   2016   and   2015  . 
  The sale of beauty products generated   17 percent   of sales in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of   2016   and   19 percent   in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of   2015  .

Reported sales   decreased     10 percent   compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  . Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales   decreased     7 percent   mainly from lower volume. Overall, prices in the segment increased 2 percent. 
  Emerging markets accounted for   $43.6 million   and   $49.9 million  , or   41   and   42 percent  , of the reported sales in the segment in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. On a local currency basis, the emerging market units' sales   decreased   by   7 percent  , primarily reflecting a significant decrease in Egypt, due to curtailed shipments in response to the imposition of stricter currency controls, and in Turkey, from a smaller, less active sales force due to the external environment and response to the Company's programs. This was partially offset by an increase in Tupperware South Africa due to a larger sales force. 
  The established market units' reported sales   decreased     8 percent  . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, these markets decreased   7 percent  , reflecting a decrease in volume, primarily due to less active and productive sales forces in Austria and Scandinavia.  
  Reported segment profit   decreased     $7.2 million  , in the   third   quarter of   2016   versus   2015  , and excluding the impact of foreign currency, decreased $6.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales in Austria, Egypt, and Scandinavia along with increased promotional spending in France. 
  On a year-to-date basis, reported sales and segment profit   decreased     11   percent and   37 percent  , respectively, compared with   2015  . Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales in   2016   were   down     7 percent   compared with   2015  . The variances largely mirror the quarter with the exception of a larger negative impact in the year-to-date comparison in France than in the third quarter and less of an impact from Scandinavia in the year-to-date period. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, segment profit was   down     32   percent on a year-to-date basis. The factors impacting the segment profit comparisons are largely the same as those impacting the quarterly comparison along with more impact on the comparison from lower profit in France and Turkey, mainly from lower sales, as well as lower group administrative costs.

The Russian ruble, South African rand, and the Turkish lire were the main currencies that impacted the year-over-year sales comparison, while the South African rand was the currency that most significantly impacted the profit comparison. 
  The Company's business in Egypt declined in the fourth quarter of 2015 and more significantly in the first through third quarters of 2016, from curtailed shipments related to currency controls. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2015, Egypt had performed well, generating meaningful sales and profit increases and generating cash in Egyptian pounds. Product for this business is sourced primarily from the Company s manufacturing facilities in Europe, and due to the imposition of the stricter currency controls beginning in 2015, the intercompany amount owed by the Egyptian business for the product and related costs totaled $8.0 million as of   September 24, 2016  , notwithstanding that the Egyptian subsidiary held $9.3 million worth of Egyptian pounds at that date. In light of the currency restrictions, the Company does not expect its operations in Egypt to improve significantly.

Reported sales   decreased     1 percent   compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  . Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, sales   decreased     4 percent  . The sales decrease was due to lower volume, partially offset by an average price increase of 1 percent. 
  Emerging markets accounted for   $160.3 million   and   $163.0 million  , or   85 percent   of the reported sales in the segment in the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  . Compared with   2015  , sales in emerging markets in 2016 were   positively   impacted by   $1.6 million   from changes in foreign currency rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates, sales in these units   decreased     3 percent  . The most significant decreases were in Indonesia from a smaller, less active sales force, in Korea, largely due to lower business-to-business sales compared with the third quarter of 2015 and in the Philippines, due to lower volume related to the exit of the fashion category. These were partially offset by China, primarily related to growth in the number of experience studios and better productivity, including from digital marketing initiatives. 
  The established market units' reported sales were even compared with third quarter 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, these markets decreased   9 percent  , reflecting a decrease in volume, primarily due to a less active sales force in Tupperware Australia/New Zealand.

Segment profit   increased     7 percent   compared with the   third   quarter of   2015  . Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, segment profit   increased     5 percent  , primarily due to the higher sales in China, a benefit from favorable resin costs, and reduced promotional expense.  
  On a year-to-date basis, reported sales   decreased     3   percent compared with the same period of   2015  . Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, sales   decreased     1   percent. The decrease in local currency sales is primarily related to smaller sales forces in India and Indonesia, in Korea due to lower business to business sales compared with 2015, and the Philippines due to lower volume related to the exit of the fashion category. This was partially offset by an increase in experience studios in China along with better productivity and from a larger sales force in Malaysia and Singapore. On a year-to-date basis, the increase in segment profit was related to the higher sales volume in China and in Malaysia and Singapore. This was partially offset by Indonesia from lower sales volume and in the Philippines related to lower sales volume and higher operating expenses.  
  In terms of foreign currencies, the change in the value of the Chinese renminbi versus the U.S. dollar had the most significant impact on the year-over-year sales and profit comparisons in the third quarter and year-to-date periods, although the Malaysian ringgit also had a meaningful impact on the year-to-date sales and profit comparisons.

Reported sales for the segment   increased     30 percent   in the   third   quarter of   2016  . Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales   increased     33 percent  . Of the   33 percent   increase in local currency sales, approximately one third of the increase reflected the impact of higher prices in the segment, mainly due to inflation in Argentina and Venezuela. 
  The most significant increase in local currency sales was in Brazil, the largest unit in South America, from higher volume of products sold. The volume improvement reflected a highly active sales force driven by strong sales force additions. The sales in Argentina and Venezuela increased primarily from higher prices mainly in light of significant inflation, though about one-fourth of the increase in Argentina was related to volume. 
  Reported segment profit   increased     $11.0 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  . Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, segment profit increased $10.1 million, primarily in Brazil from the higher sales and lower product costs and in Venezuela from $1.7 million less of an impact than last year of inventory being included in cost of goods sold at the stronger, historical exchange rate when it was procured and produced rather than the rate used to translate sales in the quarter and the transaction impact on net monetary assets from the weakening of the Venezuelan bolivar. 
  The year-to-date sales comparisons largely mirrored the quarter. The segment profit variance for the year-to-date period was largely the result of the increase in sales and lower warehousing expenses in Brazil and from $8.9 million less of an impact in connection with the Venezuelan items, which were   $4.2 million and $13.1 million  , in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  The Argentine peso and the Brazilian real had the most significant translation impacts on the year-over-year sales comparisons, while the Brazilian real was the currency that most significantly impacted the profit comparison.

Financial Condition 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources:   The Company's net working capital position   increased   by   $36.7 million   compared with the end of   2015  . Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, working capital increased   $18.0 million  , primarily reflecting a   $35.4 million   net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments around year-end and the payout of management incentives, and a   $17.4 million   increase in inventory, related to expectations for future sales being higher in the fourth quarter than the first quarter of each year. These local currency increases were partially offset by a   $37.3 million   increase in short-term borrowings, net of cash and cash equivalents. 
  The Company continues to carry debt in connection with the $600 million in senior notes due in 2021.  
  As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company had total borrowings of   $197.8 million   outstanding under its Credit Agreement, including   $193.3 million   denominated in euro.  
  Loans taken under the Credit Agreement bear interest under a formula that includes, at the Company's option, one of three different base rates, plus an applicable spread. The Company normally chooses LIBOR as its base rate. Although the Company's euro LIBOR base rate was below zero throughout the first nine months of 2016 and currently, under the Credit Agreement the base rate cannot be below zero. As of   September 24, 2016  , the Credit Agreement dictated a spread of   150   basis points, which gave the Company a weighted average interest rate on   LIBOR   based borrowings of   1.50 percent   under the Credit Agreement. 
  The Company routinely increases its revolver borrowings under the Credit Agreement and uncommitted lines during each quarter to fund operating, investing and financing activities and uses cash available at the end of each quarter to reduce borrowing levels. As a result, the Company incurs more interest expense and has higher foreign exchange exposure on the value of its cash during each quarter than would relate solely to the quarter end cash and debt balances.    
  The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including financial covenants requiring a minimum level of interest coverage and allowing a maximum amount of leverage. As of   September 24, 2016  , and currently, the Company had considerable cushion under its financial covenants. However, economic conditions, adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, lower than foreseen sales, profit and/or cash flow generation, the payment of dividends, share repurchases or the occurrence of other events discussed under  Forward Looking Statements  and elsewhere could cause noncompliance. 
  At   September 24, 2016  , the Company had   $659.3 million   of unused lines of credit, including   $400.9 million   under the committed, secured Credit Agreement, and   $258.4 million   available under various uncommitted lines around the world. If necessary, with the agreement of its lenders, the Company is permitted to increase its borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement by a total of up to $200.0 million. 
  See   Note 10   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company's debt. 
  The Company monitors the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents and diversifies its cash and cash equivalents among counterparties, which minimizes exposure to any one of these entities. Furthermore, the Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and the possible liquidity and credit risks of its counterparties. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its working capital and capital spending needs, and its current dividend. This liquidity includes to the extent that it is accessible, its cash and cash equivalents, which totaled   $98.5 million   as of   September 24, 2016  , cash flows from operating activities, and access to its Credit Agreement, as well as access to other various uncommitted lines of credit around the world. The Company has not experienced any limitations on its ability to access its committed facility.

Cash and cash equivalents ( cash ) totaled   $98.5 million   as of   September 24, 2016  . Of this amount, $95.8 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. Of the cash held outside of the United States, approximately 30 percent was not eligible for repatriation due to the level of past statutory earnings by the foreign units in which the cash was held or other local restrictions. An additional 40 percent of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries in which the Company's current intent is to indefinitely reinvest the cash, as it is needed for working capital and to otherwise fund on-going operations. In the event circumstances change, leading to the conclusion that these funds will not be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would need to provide at that time for the income taxes that would be triggered upon their repatriation. The remaining cash is subject to repatriation tax effects.  
  The Company s most significant foreign currency exposures are to the Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, euro, Indonesian rupiah and the Mexican peso. Business units in which the Company generated at least $100 million of sales in   2015   included Brazil, China, Germany, Indonesia, Fuller Mexico, Tupperware Mexico and Tupperware United States and Canada. Of these units, sales by Brazil and Indonesia exceeded $200 million. Downturns in the Company's business in these units, including but not limited to, difficulties in making additions to, retention and activity of the Company's independent sales force or the success of new products and/or promotional programs, could adversely impact the Company's ability to generate operating cash flows. 
  Operating Activities:   Net cash   provided by   operating activities for the periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   was   $92.3 million   and   $72.2 million  , respectively.   The favorable comparison primarily reflected a lower cash outflow than in 2015 from the Company's hedging activities, lower cash tax payments, and better management of inventory. The net impact of these items was partially offset by an increase in outflows of cash related to other net working capital items, particularly payables due to the timing of payments at year-end.  
  Investing Activities:   During the year-to-date periods of   2016   and   2015  , the Company had   $38.2 million   and   $42.4 million  , respectively, of capital expenditures. In both   2016   and   2015  , the most significant capital expenditures were related to molds. In   2016   and   2015  , capital expenditures included $9.0 million and $8.8 million, respectively, related to manufacturing and supply chain capabilities excluding molds. Partially offsetting the capital spending were proceeds from the sale of long-term assets of $31.8 million and $17.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily reflecting transactions associated with land near the Company's Orlando, Florida headquarters.  
  Financing Activities:   Dividends paid to shareholders were   $104.0 million   and   $103.6 million   in the first nine months   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Proceeds received from the exercise of stock options were $  0.6 million   and   $7.6 million   in the year-to-date periods of 2016 and   2015  , respectively. The Company also increased revolver borrowings through its Credit Agreement by   $33.0 million   for the funding of investing and financing activities in excess of cash flow generated by operating activities and in light of a higher cash balance in September 2016 than at the end of 2015.    
  Open market share repurchases by the Company are permitted under an authorization that runs until February 1, 2017 and allows up to $2.0 billion to be spent. There were no share repurchases under this program during the first nine months of 2016 or 2015. Since 2007, the Company had spent $1.29 billion to repurchase 21.3 million shares under this program. Going forward, in setting share repurchase amounts, the Company expects to target over time a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.75 times (as defined in the Company's Credit Agreement). The Company does not currently plan to make open market share repurchases. 
  Repurchases under the Company s stock incentive programs are made when employees use shares to satisfy the minimum statutorily required withholding taxes. In the year-to-date periods of   2016   and   2015  ,   21,189   and   12,847   shares were retained to fund withholding taxes, totaling   $1.1 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively.

           Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
     One of the Company's market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on its borrowings. The Company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings and the currencies in which it borrows.

     Table of Contents  

Loans taken under the Credit Agreement are of a short duration and bear interest under a formula that includes, at the Company's option, one of three different base rates, plus an applicable spread. The Company generally selects the London interbank offered rate ("  LIBOR  "). Although the Company s euro LIBOR base rate was below zero throughout the first nine months of 2016 and currently, under the Credit Agreement, the base rate cannot be below zero. As of   September 24, 2016  , the Credit Agreement dictated a spread of   150   basis points, which gave the Company a weighted average interest rate on its U.S. dollar and euro denominated LIBOR based borrowings under the Credit Agreement of   1.50 percent  .  
  As of   September 24, 2016  , the Company had total borrowings of   $197.8 million   outstanding under its Credit Agreement, with   $193.3 million   denominated in euro. If short-term interest rates varied by 10 percent, which in the Company's case would mean short duration U.S. dollar and euro LIBOR, with all other variables remaining constant, the Company's annual interest expense would not be significantly impacted. 
  The Company routinely increases its revolver borrowings under the Credit Agreement and uncommitted lines during each quarter to fund operating, investing and financing activities and uses cash available at the end of each quarter to reduce borrowing levels. As a result, the Company incurs more interest expense and has higher foreign exchange exposure on the value of its cash during each quarter than would relate solely to the quarter end cash and debt balances. 
  A significant portion of the Company's sales and profit come from its international operations. Although these operations are geographically dispersed, which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries, the Company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations. These risks include local political and economic environments and relations between foreign and U.S. governments.  
  Another economic risk of the Company is exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of its international operations. The Company is not able to project, in any meaningful way, the effect of these possible fluctuations on translated amounts or future earnings. This is due to the Company's constantly changing exposure to various currencies, the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the U.S. dollar and the large number of currencies involved, although the Company's most significant income and cash flow exposures are to the Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, euro, Indonesian rupiah and Mexican peso. 
  Although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the Company's local product sourcing in many countries, a strengthening U.S. dollar generally has a negative impact on the Company. In response to this fact, the Company uses financial instruments, such as forward contracts, to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations. In addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates, the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations. The Company also hedges, with these instruments, certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable, non-permanent intercompany transactions and a portion of purchases forecasted for generally up to the following 15 months. The Company does not seek to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translated value of the sales, profit or cash flow generated by its operations.  
  While the Company's derivatives that hedge a portion of its equity in its foreign subsidiaries and its fair value hedges of balance sheet risks all work together to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses, they result in an impact to operating cash flows as they are settled. For the year-to-date periods ended   September 24, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , the cash flow impact of these currency hedges were   outflow  s of   $5.6 million   and   $21.1 million  , respectively.  
  The U.S. dollar equivalent of the Company's most significant net open forward contracts as of   September 24, 2016   were to buy euro worth   $108.4 million   and to sell   $21.7 million   in   Indonesian rupiah  . In agreements to sell foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, for example, an appreciating dollar versus the opposing currency would generate a cash inflow for the Company at settlement, with the opposite result in agreements to buy foreign currencies for U.S. dollars. The notional amounts change based upon changes in the Company's outstanding currency exposures. Based on rates existing as of   September 24, 2016  , the Company was in a net   receivable   position of approximately   $2.5 million   related to its currency hedges under forward contracts, which upon settlement, could have a significant impact on the Company's cash flow. The Company records the impact of forward points in net interest expense.

     Table of Contents  

A precise calculation of the impact of currency fluctuations is not practical since some of the contracts are between non-U.S. dollar currencies. The Company continuously monitors its foreign currency exposure and expects to enter into additional contracts to hedge exposure in the future. See further discussion regarding the Company's hedging activities for foreign currency in   Note 11   to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  The Company is subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations. The risks related to creditworthiness and non performance have been considered in the determination of fair value for the Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The Company continues to closely monitor its counterparties and will take action, as appropriate and possible, to further manage its counterparty credit risk.  
  The Company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and, in particular, the cost of oil and natural gas-based resins, including the fact that in some cases resin prices are actually in, or are based on, currencies other than that of the unit buying the resin, which introduces a currency exposure that is incremental to the exposure to changing market prices. Resins are the primary material used in production of most Tupperware        products, and the Company estimates that   2016   cost of sales will include approximately   $134 million   for the cost of resin in the Tupperware        brand products it produces and has contract manufactured. The Company uses many different kinds of resins in its products. About three-fourths of its resins are  polyolefins  (simple chemical structure, easily refined from oil), and as such, the price of these is typically strongly affected by the underlying price of oil and natural gas. The remaining one-fourth of its resins is more highly engineered, where the price of oil and natural gas plays a less direct role in determining price. With a comparable product mix and exchange rates, a 10 percent fluctuation in the cost of resin would impact the Company's annual cost of sales by approximately   $13 million   compared with the prior year. In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company estimates there was a $0.7 million negative impact on its gross margin related to sales of the Tupperware        products it produced and had contract manufactured due to resin cost changes, as compared with   2015  . For full year   2016  , the estimated impact of resin cost changes, on a local currency basis, on the Company's gross margin related to sales of the Tupperware        products it produces and has contract manufactured is a benefit of approximately   $1.5 million  , as compared with   2015  . In addition to the impact of the price of oil and natural gas, the price the Company pays for its resins is also impacted by the relative changes in supply and demand. The Company partially manages its risk associated with rising resin costs by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short-term pricing arrangements. It also manages its margin through cash flow hedges in some cases when it purchases resin in currencies, or effectively in currencies, other than that of the purchasing unit, through the pricing of its products, with price increases on its product offerings generally in line with consumer inflation in each market, and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and promotionally priced offers. It also, on occasion, makes advance material purchases to take advantage of current favorable pricing. At this point in time, the Company has determined that entering into forward contracts for resin is not practical or cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place. However, should circumstances warrant, the Company may consider such contracts in the future.  
  The Company has a program to sell land held for development around its Orlando, Florida headquarters ("Orlando Land"). This program is exposed to the risks inherent in the real estate development process. Included among these risks is the ability to obtain all necessary government approvals, the success of attracting tenants for commercial or residential developments in the Orlando real estate market, obtaining financing and general economic conditions, such as interest rate increases. Based on the variety of factors that impact the Company's ability to close sales transactions, it cannot predict when the program will be completed.
