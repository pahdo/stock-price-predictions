In September 2015, we announced that we had launched a new nucleic acid sequencing platform, the PacBio Sequel  System, which   will   provide higher throughput, more scalability, a reduced footprint and lower sequencing project costs compared to the PacBio      RS II System, while maintaining the existing benefits of our SMRT   Sequencing   Technology. 

The names  Pacific Biosciences,   PacBio,   SMRT,   SMRTbell,   Sequel  and our logo are our trademarks  . 

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Basis of Presentation 

In the opinion of management, our accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ( Financial Statements ) have been prepared on a consistent basis with our December 31, 2015 audited Consolidated Financial Statements and include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state the information set forth herein. The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and, as permitted by such rules and regulations, omit certain information and footnote disclosures necessary to present the statements in accordance with   accounting principles generally accepted in the United States   ( U.S. GAAP ). These Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the   nine  -month period   ended   September   30  ,    2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year or any future periods. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.   GAAP   requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements.   Our estimates include, but are not limited to,   the valuation of inventory, revenue valuation, the   valuation of a financing derivative and long-term notes,   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, the   delivery period for collaboration agreements, the useful lives assigned to long-lived assets, and the computation provisions for income taxes.   Actual results could differ materially from these estimates  .   

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

The following table   sets forth the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis as of   September   30  , 2016   and December 31, 201  5  , respectively  : 

7   

Table of Contents  

We classify our   cash deposits and money market funds within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using bank balances or quoted market prices.   We classify our   investments as Level 2 instruments based on market pricing and other observable inputs.   W  e   did not classify any   of our investments within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

During the   nine  -  month period  s   ended   September 3  0,     201  6   and 201  5  ,     there were   no   impairments of our investments. 

The estimated fair value of the Financing Derivative l  iability (as defined in Note 6     Notes Payable  ) was determined using Level 3 inputs, or significant unobservable inputs.   Refer to Note 6     Notes Payable for a detailed description and valuation approach.   Changes to the estimated fair value of the Financing Derivative are recorded in  Other income (expense), net  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive   income (  loss  )  .   

The following table provides the changes   in the estimated fair value of the Financi  ng   Derivative during the   nine  -month period ended   September   30  , 201  6   (in thousands): 

During the     nine  -  month period ended   September   30  , 201  6   there were   no   transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 assets or liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis and   the   valuation techniques   used   did not change compared   to our   established practice.  

Financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

The carrying amount of our accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, current  ,    approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying value of our other liabilities, non-current  ,   approximates fair value due to the time to maturity and prevailing market rates. 

We determined the estimated fair value of the Notes (as defined in Note 6     Notes Payable  ) using Level 3 inputs, or significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of the Notes was determined by comparing the difference between the estimated fair value of the Notes with and without the Financing Derivative by calculating the respective present values from future cash flows using   a    weighted average market yield   of   1  1  .  4  %     and   1  3.5  %     at   September     30  ,   201  6   and December 31, 201  5  , respectively  .

Table of Contents  

The estimated fair value and carrying value of the Notes are   as follows (in thousands): 

Net   Income     (l  oss  )   per Share 

Basic net income (loss) per share and diluted net income (loss) per share are presented in conformity with ASC 260   Earnings per Share  , for all periods presented. Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and potential shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, warrants and common stock issuable pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the treasury stock method. 

The following table presents the calculation of weighted average   number of   shares of common stock used in the computations of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share amounts presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

The following outstanding common stock options and warrants to purchase common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted net income(loss) per share for the periods presented because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect (in thousands):

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 

In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU     ) No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing   the   lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost   and net realizable value test.   ASU 2015-11 is effective for annual report periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is effective for us in the   first quarter of 2017.   We have   elected to early adopt ASU 2015-11 effective   beginning with   the three-month period ended March 31, 2016, as permitted by the standard. The early adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In March   2016, the FASB issued   A  SU     2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ,     which amends the current stock compensation guidance. The amendments simplify the accounting for the taxes related to stock based compensation, including adjustments to how excess tax benefits and a company's payments for tax withholdings should be classified. The standard is effective for fiscal   periods   beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases.   The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840,   Leases  .   ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.   We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ,    requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or   the   cumulative effect transition method.   ASU 2014-09 is effective for   periods beginning after December 15, 201  7  , 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date. Accordingly, the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 3. CONTRACTUAL REVENUE  

During September 2013, we entered into a Development, Commercialization and License Agreement (the  Roche Agreement ) with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd ( Roche ), pursuant to which we account for, and recognize as revenue, the up-front payment   received thereunder   using the proportional performance method over the periods in which the delivery of elements   pursuant to   the   Roche Agreement   occurs. We recognize revenue   under th  e Roche A  greement   using a straight-line convention over the service periods of the deliverables as this method approximates our performance of services pursuant to the   agreement  . Out of the   $35.0   million upfront cash payment received, quarterly amortization of   $1.7   million has been recognized as contractual revenue from the fourth quarter of 2013   to the fourth quarter of 2014. Beginning   in     the three-m  onth period ended March 31, 2015,   we revised the estimated development period related to our contractual revenue amortization based on increasing certainty of the development time on a prospective approach   and quarterly amortization of   $3.6   million has been recognized as contractual revenue   for each of the four quarters of 2015 and for the   each of the   first   t  hree     quarter  s   of 2016  .     As of   September   30, 2016  ,     the   total   deferred contractual revenue balance was   $  1.3   million,   relat  ing   to the amount   allocated to the deliverable of our participation on the joint steering committee   and   will be fully amortized by the third quarter of 2026  .    

Further  , the Roche Agreement provide  d   for additional payments totaling up to   $40.0   million upon the achievement of certain development milestones. Consideration from development milestones is recognized in the period in which a milestone is achieved only if the milestone is considered substantive in its entirety.   We achieved the first development milestone under the Roche     Agreement and reco  gnized   the related   $10.0   million as contractual revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014. We achieved the second and third (final) development milestones under the Roche Agreement and recognized the related   $10.0   million and   $20.0   million     as contractual revenue   during the three-month period  s   ended June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

NOTE     5  .    INVENTORY 

As of   September   30  , 2016 and   December 31, 201  5  ,    our   inventory     consisted of the following components: 

NOTE 6. NOTES PAYABLE 

Pursuant to a Facility Agreement (the  Facility Agreement ) we entered into with entities affiliated with Deerfield Management Company, L.P. (collectively,  Deerfield ) during February 2013, we issued promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of   $20.5   million (the  Notes ). The Notes bear simple interest at a rate of   8.75%   per annum, payable quarterly in arrears commencing on April 1, 2013.  

In connection with the execution of the Facility Agreement, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of   5,500,000   shares of common stock immediately exercisable at an exercise price per share initially equal to   $2.63   (the  Warrants ).   As of   September 30  , 2016  ,    no   warrant  s     remained   outstanding.   Please see Note 8 Stockholders    E  quity for the warrant-related activities during the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016. 

In addition, the Facility Agreement requires us to maintain consolidated cash and cash equivalents on the last day of each calendar quarter of not less than   $2.0   million. As security for our repayment of our obligations under the Facility Agreement, we granted to Deerfield a security interest in substantially all of our property. 

The Facility Agreement has a maximum term of   seven   years from inception  .    Subsequent to the date of the Facility Agreement, at the election of the holders of Notes representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, the Notes holders may elect to receive   25%   of the net proceeds from any financing that includes an equity component, including without limitation, the sale or issuance of our common stock, options, warrants or other securities convertible or exchangeable for shares of our common stock, as payment of the Notes. This right is subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Facility Agreement  .    The Notes holders have the option to require us to repay the Notes if we complete a Major Transaction   (as defined in the Facility Agreement)  , including a change of control or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally, the principal balance of the Facility Agreement may become immediately   due and payable upon an E  vent of   D  efault   (as defined in the Facility Agreement)  , in which case the Notes holders would have the right to require us to repay   100%   of the principal amount of the loan, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Facility Agreement does not provide for a prepayment of the Notes at our option. 

Financing Derivative 

A number of features embedded in the Notes to the Facility Agreement   met the requirements to be accounted for as   a    derivative, including the indemnification of certain withholding taxes and the acceleration of debt upon (i) a qualified financing, (ii) an Event of Default, (iii) a Major Transaction, and (iv) the exercise of the warrant via offset to debt principal. These features represent a single derivative (the  Financing Derivative ) that was bifurcated from the debt instrument and accounted for as a liability at fair value, with changes in fair value between reporting periods recorded in other income (expense), net.  

The estimated fair value of the Financing Derivative was determined by comparing the difference between the fair value of the Notes with and without the Financing Derivative by calculating the respective present values from future cash flows   using   1  1  .  4  %   and

1  3  .5%     weighted average market yield     at   September   30  , 2016   and December 31, 201  5  , respectively  .    The estimated fair value of   the Financing Derivative as of   September   30  , 2016   and December 31, 201  5     was   $0.  2   million   and   $0.  6   million  , respectively  . 

Notes 

We initially recorded the Notes and Warrants at   $14.1   million and   $6.4   million, respectively, based upon the relative fair value allocation of the   $20.5   million of proceeds. The carrying value of the Notes at the inception of the debt was   $12.8     million, resulting in an original issue discount of   $7.7   million.     As of   September   30  , 2016   and December 31, 201  5  ,    a    debt discount   of   $  4.  6   million and   $  5  .4   million, respectively, remained to be amortized through   February 2020  , the maturity of the Notes. 

NOTE 7  .    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

L  eases 

In December 2009 we entered into a lease agreement for a manufacturing and office facility in Menlo Park. In order for the facility to meet our needs and operating requirements, substantial tenant improvements, including improvements to the structural elements and principal operating systems of the facility, were necessary. The lessor provided a tenant improvement allowance of   $1.8   million to apply towards the necessary improvements and we remained obligated for additional amounts over the afforded allowance. Due to our involvement in and the nature of the renovations made to the facility and our obligations to fund the costs of renovations exceeding the incentives afforded to us, we account for the facility as if we are the owner. Accordingly  ,   we recorded   $3.0   million of building and leasehold improvement assets, reflecting the   $1.2   million fair value of the facility prior to commencing renovations and the $1.8 million of landlord incentives within property and equipment, net and a corresponding liability recorded to facility financing obligation.  

A  s a   result of   the   lease amendment agreement described below, future rent expense associated with   our existing Menlo Park facility   lease  s   was reduced to   zero  . The   remaining long-term facility financing obligation  s     associated with th  ese   lease  s, presented as  Other liabilities, non-current  on the condensed   consolidated balance sheets at   September   30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015,   w  ere     $1.  6   million   and   $1.4   million,   respectively  .    

Lease Amendment Agreement 

On July 23, 2015, we entered into a Lease Amendment Agreement (the  Lease Amendment Agreement ) with Peninsula Innovation Partners, LLC (the  Existing Landlord ), which amends the terms and conditions of certain of our existing Menlo Park facility real property leases. The Lease Amendment Agreement provides for, among other things, amendments of the term for certain of the existing leases, the termination of all renewal, expansion and extension rights contained in any of the existing leases with the Existing Landlord (including our options to extend the terms for certain of the existing leases for two consecutive five-year periods), as well as rent abatement for a specified period of time. As consideration for our agreement to amend the existing leases pursuant to the Lease Amendment Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, we became eligible to receive up to   four   payments of   $5.0   million each from the Existing Landlord over time (the  Landlord Payments ), and rent abatement for the remainder of the lease. In the event that we breach any of the leases and fail to cure such breach within the time permitted, the Existing Landlord would have no obligation to make the final $5.0 million payment. On September 1, 2015, the permitting process related to an architectural approval and a change of use permit with respect to our new premises at 1315 O Brien Drive, Menlo Park, California (the  O Brien Premises ) was completed, which satisfied the contingencies under the Lease Amendment Agreement. As a result, we recorded   $23.0   million in    Gain on lease amendments  in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the   three-month period ended September 3  0  , 2015  , reflecting that   our rent payments were reduced to zero for the remaining term of our existing Menlo Park facility real property leases, the aggregate of   $20.0   million in Landlord Payments became receivable and any associated financing obligation was revalued. Of the $20.0 million in Landlord Payments, the first   $5.0   million Landlord Payment was received in September 2015  ,    the second   $5.0   million Landlord Payment was received in February 2016   and   the   third   $5.0   million Landlord Payment was received in   August   2016  .   

In June 2016   we entered into a Second Lease Amendment Agreement with the Existing Landlord that modified the payment schedule for the   final   $5.0   million  ,    such that   $2.6   million became a short term receivable and was recorded in    Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets  and   $2.4   million was   recorded in    Other Long-term Assets  in the condensed consolidated balance sheets   as of September 30, 2016  .    We do not believe that there are any remaining performance obligations relating to the remaining Landlord Payments.  

O Brien Lease Agreement 

On July 22, 2015, we entered into a new lease agreement (the  O Brien Lease ) with respect to the O Brien Premises. The term of the O Brien Lease is one hundred thirty-two   (132)   months, commencing on the date that is the later of April 15, 2016 or the date on which the O Brien Premises landlord has substantially completed certain shell improve  ments and tenant improvements. Based on the currently agreed construction schedule, the O Brien Lease   is expected to   comme  n  ce   in   the   fourth   quarter of   2016  .     Base monthly rent   will   be abated for the first six (6) months of the lease term and thereafter will be   $540,000   per month during the first year of the lease

term, with specified annual increases thereafter until reaching   $711,000   per month during the last twelve (12) months of the lease term. We were required to pay   $2,160,000   in prepaid rent which will be applied to the monthly rent installments due for the first to fourth months after the rent abatement period. We were required to establish a deposit of   $4.5   million in the form of a letter of credit in October 2015; and, as such, $4.5 million was recorded in  Long-term restricted cash  in the   condensed   consolidated balance sheet as of   both   September   30  , 2016 and   December 31, 2015  .    The landlord is obligated to construct certain shell improvements at the landlord s cost and expense and provide us with improvement allowances in the amount of   $12.6   million.  

Under the O Brien Lease, we expect to pay approximately   $80   million in rent and   $24   million in operating expenses over the expected lease term. In addition to the lease payments, we are also required to reimburse the landlord for certain improvement costs in excess of the tenant improvement allowances provided. These improvement costs, along with the costs associated with the anticipated move to the O Brien Premises, are expected to be substantial in nature. These future expenditures   are expected to be partially offset by the   $  5  .0   million of future Landlord Payments from our Existing Landlord as described above.    

Legal 

On November 2, 2016, we filed a complaint against Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd., Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Inc. and Metrichor, Ltd. (together,  ONT ) with the U.S. International   Trade Commission for patent infringement. We are seeking injunctive relief with   respect to several ONT products  , including ONT s MinION and PromethION devices. The complaint is based on our U.S. Patent No. 9,404,146, entitled  Compositions and methods for nucleic acid sequencing  which covers   novel   methods for sequencing single nucleic acid molecules using linked double-stranded nucleic acid templates, providing improved sequencing accuracy. We are seeking, among other things, an exclusion order permanently barring entry of infringing ONT products into the Unite  d States, and   a cease and desist order preventing ONT from advertising and selling infringing products in the United States.    The estimated financial effect associated with this   complaint   cannot be made as of this 10-Q filing time.  

From time to time, we may   also be involved   in a variety of   other claims, lawsuits  , investigations and proceedings relating to securities laws, product liability, patent infringement, contract disputes, employment and other matters that arise in the normal course of our business. In addition, third parties may, from time to time, assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We currently do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any of the matters described above is probable or reasonably estimable, or that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business; however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of litigation and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

NOTE 8. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 

Equity Offering 

During the three-month period ended March 31, 2016,   we issued 3.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $8.80 per share through our  at-the-market  offering, resulting in net proceeds of $26.5 million. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, we issued 3.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $9.56 per share through our  at-the-market  offering, resulting in net proceeds of $31.7 million. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, no shares of common stock were issued through our  at-the-market  offering. In total, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, we issued 6.5 million shares of our common stock through our  at-the-market  offering, resulting in net proceeds of $58.2 million.  

As of September 30, 2016, no shares of common stock remained available for future sales through our  at-the-market  offering. 

Warrants 

In connection with the execution of the Facility Agreement, we issued immediately exercisable warrants to purchase 5,500,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price per share initially equal to $2.63, all of which were outstanding at December 31, 2015. The number of shares of common stock into which the warrants are exercisable and the exercise price will be adjusted to reflect any stock splits, payment of stock dividends, recapitalizations, reclassifications or other similar adjustments in the number of outstanding shares of common stock. The exercise price may also be adjusted to reflect certain dividends or other distributions, including distributions of stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement or similar transaction  .   

During the three months ended March 31, 2016, warrants to purchase 3,818,000 shares of common stock were net exercised, resulting in the issuance of approximately 3.0 million shares. During the three months ended June 30, 2016,   warrants to purchase the remaining 1,682,000 shares of common stock were net exercised, resulting in the issuance of approximately 1.2 million shares in the first week of July 2016. The cashless net exercises of the warrants did not result in any additional funds being collected by us.  

As of September 30, 2016, no warrants remained outstanding.

Overview  

We   design, develop and manufacture sequencing systems   to help scientists resolve genetically complex problems.   Based on our novel Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT     ) Sequencing technology, our products enable:   de novo   genome assembly to finish genomes in order to more fully identify, annotate and decipher genomic structures; full-length transcript analysis to improve annotations in reference genomes, characterize alternatively spliced isoforms   in important gene families,   and find novel genes; targeted sequencing to more comprehensively characterize genetic variations; and   real-time kinetic information for epigenome characterization  . Our technology   provides high accuracy, ultra-long reads, uniform coverage, and is the only DNA sequencing technology that provides the ability to simultaneously detect epigenetic changes  .    PacBio        sequencing systems, including consumables and software, provide a simple, fast, end-to-end workflow for SMRT Sequencing  . 

In September 2015, we announced that we had launched a new nucleic acid sequencing platform, the Sequel  TM     System, which will provide higher throughput, more scalability, a reduced footprint and lower sequencing project costs compared to the PacBio      RS II System, while maintaining the existing benefits of our SMRT   Sequencing   Technology. 

Basis of Presentation 

Revenue 

During the three  -     and   nine  -  month periods ended   September   30,   2016 and   2015  , product revenue was primarily derived from the sale of   Sequel and   RS II instruments and associated consumables. Service and other revenue was primarily derived from product maintenance agreements sold on our installed ins  truments.   Contractual revenue   was derived from   the quarterly amortization from the   non-refundable upfront payment of $35.0 million   that   we received   in   September 2013 pursuant to the Roche Agreement.     As of September 30, 2016, $33.7 million of the $35.0 million upfront payment has been amortized. The remainder is currently scheduled to be amortized   less than   $100 thousand per quarter through 20  2  6.  

In addition,   the Roche Agreement provides for additional payments totaling up to $40.0 million upon the achievement of certain development milestones. Consideration from development milestones   is recognized in the period in which a milestone is achieved only if the milestone is considered substantive in its entirety.   We achieved the first development milestone under the Roche Agreement and recorded the related $10.0 million as contractual revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014. We achieved the second and third (final) development milestones under the Roche Agreement and recognized the related $10.0 million and $20.0 million     as contractual revenue during the   three-month period  s   ended Jun  e 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively  . 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue reflects the direct cost of product components, third-party manufacturing services and our internal manufacturing overhead and customer service infrastructure costs incurred to produce, deliver, maintain and support our instruments, consumables, and services. There are no incremental costs associated with our contractual revenue; all product development costs are reflected in research and development expense. 

Manufacturing overhead is predominantly comprised of labor  , facilities and   costs related to information technology.   We determine and capitalize manufacturing overhead into inventory based on a standard cost model that approximates actual costs.  Prior to achieving manufacturing volumes that correlated with our estimated normal capacity (the production levels expected to be achieved over a number of periods under normal circumstances with available resources), we based our capitalized overhead relative to our normal capacity.  Prior to achieving normal capacity, excess manufacturing resources were engaged in research and development  

17   

Table of Contents  

activities, including     next generation products, internal use research products, and general support activities. As such, manufacturing costs in excess of amounts reflected in inventory were expensed as a component of research and development expense.  

Service costs include the direct costs of components used in support, repair and maintenance of customer instruments as well as the cost of personnel, materials, shipping and support infrastructure necessary to support the installed customer base.  

Research and Development Expense 

Research and development expense consists primarily of expenses for personnel engaged in the development of our SMRT   Sequencing   technology, the design and development of our future products and current product enhancements. These expenses also include prototype-related expenditures, development equipment and supplies, facilities costs and other related overhead. We expense research and development costs during the period in which the costs are incurred. However, we defer and capitalize non-refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are received or the related services are rendered.  

Sales, General and Administrative Expense  

S  ales  , general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.  

Interest Expense 

Interest expense is primarily related to   our   debt facility and includes the amortization of debt discount and other related costs. To a lesser extent,   these   amounts also include interest expense relating to our facility financing obligations resulting from a lease agreement entered into in 2010. We expect interest expense to increase during future periods as the recorded value   of our debt facility   accretes to the amount due at maturity. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and investments, accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums related to investments, net gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, net gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the financing derivative and foreign income taxes. 

Income Taxes 

Except for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015,   we have incurred net losses   in every quarter since inception   and have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for such losses as they have been   fully   offset by valuation allowances. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited   Financial S  tatements, which have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The preparation of these Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

There have been no   material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5  .

Revenue 

Total revenue for the three-month period ended   September 30  , 2016 was $2  5.  1   million compared to $  13.9   million for the same period during 2015.  

Product revenue during the three-month period ended   September   30, 2016 consisted of $  11.5   million from sales of Sequel and RS II instruments and $  6.5   million from sales of consumables, compared to $  2.2   million from sales of RS II instruments and $  5.4   million from sales of consumables for the same period during 2015. Instrument revenue recognized for the three-month period ended   September   30, 2016 primarily stemmed from Sequel instrument installations. The increase in consumable sales   was     primarily   attributable to a larger installed base of instruments.   G  oing forward, we expect almost all of our new installations to be Sequel Systems.  

Service and other revenue of $3.  5   million and $2.  8   million for the three-month periods ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was primarily derived from product maintenance agreements sold on our installed instruments. The increase in service and other revenue was   primarily   attributable to supporting   a    larger installed base of instruments.  

Contractual revenue relates to the quarterly amortization of $3.6 million in each of the three-month periods ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015 from the non-refundable upfront payment of $35.0 million we received during September 2013 pursuant to the Roche Agreement.  

Gross Profit 

Gross profit for the   third   quarter of 2016 was $1  2.  6     million, resulting in a gross margin of 5  0.  3  %, compared to gross profit of $  6.6   million and a gross margin of   47.1  % for the same period in 2015. The   increase in   gross profit and   gross   margin for the   third quarter of   2016 over the same period in 2015   was primarily due to the     shift from sales of RS II instruments in 2015 to sales of higher margin Sequel instruments in 2016  , as well as growth in sales of Sequel instruments in 2016  .   

Cost of product revenue was $  9.3   million for the three-month period ended   September   30  , 2016, compared to cost of product revenue of $  5.1   million for the same period during 2015.   The   increase   in cost of product revenue was   primarily   due to   increased product cost associated with higher product revenue.  

C  ost of service and other revenue for the three-month period ended   September 3  0  , 2016 was $  3.  2   million for the   third quarter of   2016, compared to $2.  2   million for the same period during 2015. The increase in cost of service and other revenue was primarily driven by the increased material and labor costs associated with supporting   a larger installed base of   instruments.

Research and Development Expense 

During the three-month period   ended   September 30,   2016, research and development expense increased by $  1.3   million, or   8  %, compared to the same period during 2015. The increase in research and development expense was primarily attribut  able   to an increase of $  1.5   million in compensation expenses   resulting from increased headcount  , including that from stock-based compensation expense  ,    partially offset by   a decrease of $0.3 million in production development costs  .    Research and development expense included stock-based compensation expense of $  2.1   million and $1  .2   million during the three-month periods ended   September   30  , 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Sales, General and Administrative Expense 

During the three-month period ended   September   30  , 2016, s  ales  , general and administrative expense increased by $  1.  1   million, or   10  %, compared to the same period during 2015. The increase in sales, general and administrative   expense was primarily attributable   to an increase   of $  1.  1     million   for higher   compensation   expenses resulting from increased headcount  , including that from st  ock-based compensation expense  .    Sales, general and administrative expense included stock-based compensation expense of $2.  4   million and $1.  7   million during the three-month periods ended   September   30  , 2016 and 2015  , respectively  .    

Gain on lease amendments 

On July 23, 2015, we entered into a Lease Amendment Agreement (the  Lease Amendment Agreement ) with Peninsula Innovation Partners, LLC (the  Existing Landlord ), which amend  ed   the terms and conditions of certain of our existing Menlo Park facility real property leases. The Lease Amendment Agreement provides for, among other things, amendments of the term for certain of the existing leases, the termination of all renewal, expansion and extension rights contained in any of the existing leases with the Existing Landlord (including our options to extend the terms for certain of the existing leases for two consecutive five-year periods), as well as rent abatement for a specified period of time. As consideration for our agreement to amend the existing leases pursuant to the Lease Amendment Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, we became eligible to receive up to   four   payments of   $5.0   million each from the Existing Landlord over time (the  Landlord Payments ), and rent abatement for the remainder of the lease. In the event that we breach any of the leases and fail to cure such breach within the time permitted, the Existing Landlord would have no obligation to make the final $5.0 million payment. On September 1, 2015, the permitting process related to an architectural approval and a change of use permit with respect to our new premises at 1315 O Brien Drive, Menlo Park, California (the  O Brien Premises ) was completed, which satisfied the contingencies under the Lease Amendment Agreement. As a result, we recorded   $23.0   million in    Gain on lease amendments  in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive   income   for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, reflecting that   our rent payments were reduced to zero for the remaining term of our existing Menlo Park facility real property leases, the aggregate of   $20.0   million in Landlord Payments became receivable and any associated financing obligation was revalued. Of the $20.0 million in Landlord Payments, the first   $5.0   million Landlord Payment was received in September 2015  ,    the second   $5.0   million Landlord Payment was received in February 2016   and   the   third   $5.0   million Landlord Payment was received in   August   2016  .   

During   June 2016  ,    we entered into a Second Lease Amendment Agreement with the Existing Landlord   which   modified the payment schedule for the   final   $5.0   million,   such that $2.6 million became a short term receivable and was recorded in    Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets  and $2.4 million was   recorded in    Other Long-term Assets  in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016  .    We do not believe that there are any remaining performance obligations relating to the remaining Landlord Payments.  

Interest Expense 

Interest expense for the three-month period ended   September   30  , 2016   and 2015   related primarily to the debt facility entered   into   in February 2013.

Revenue 

Total revenue for the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 201  6   was $  6  5.0   million compared to $  56.5   million for the same period during 201  5  .   

Product revenue during the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 201  6   consisted of $  27.8   million from sales of   Sequel and   RS II instruments and $  16.2   million from sales of consumables, compared to $1  3.5   million from sales of instruments and $  14.2   million from sales of consumables for the same period during 201  5  . The increase in instrument sales   was   primarily attributable to a larger number of new   system   installations. The increase in consumable sales   was   primarily attributable to a larger installed instrument base  .     We anticipate product revenue to   increase   for 2016     compared with 2015   and goin  g forward, we expect almost all   of our new installations to be Sequel Systems  . 

Service and other revenue of   $  10.  2     million and $  8.0   million for the   nine  -month periods ended   September   30,   2016 and   2015, respectively, was primarily derived from product maintenance agreements sold on our installed instruments. The increase in service and other revenue year over year was primarily attributable to a larger installed base of instruments.  

Contractual revenue   was   $  10.8   million and $  20.8   million for the   nine  -month periods ended   September   30,   2016 and   2015, respectively,   $10.8 million of contractual revenue was recorded in each of the periods   from the amortization of the non-refundable up-front payment of $35.0 million we received during September 2013 pu  rsuant to the Roche Agreement.   In addition, we achieved the second development milestone under the Roche Agreement and we recorded the related $10.0 million as contractual revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.    

For the three-month period ending December 31, 2016, we expect to record   less than   $100 thousand in contractual revenue, leaving approximately $1.3 million to be amortized through 2026.  

Gross Profit 

Gross profit was $  32.  8   million, representing a gross margin of 5  0.  4  % for the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 201  6, compared to a gross profit of $2  7.0   million,   representing a gross margin of 4  7.8  %     for the same period of 2015.   Even including t  he $10.0 million   in contractual revenue at 100% margin   recorded during the third quarter of   201  5, gross profit and gross margin for the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 201  6    in  creased over the same period in 2015 primarily   due to   the   shift from sales of RS II instr  uments in   2015 to sales of higher margin Sequel instruments   in 2016.

Table of Contents  

Cost of product revenue   was $23.3 million for both the nine  -month period  s   ended   September 30  , 201  6   and   201  5  . While a larger number of instruments were installed in 2016 compared with 2015, the total costs of sales was similar, as the Sequel instruments installed in 2016 had a lower average cost per instrument as compared with that of the RS instrument  s   installed in 2015. 

Cost of service and other revenue was $  8.9   million for the   nine  -month period ended   September 3  0, 2016, compared to $  6.2   million for the same period during 2015. The increase of $  2  .7 million in cost of service and other revenue was primarily driven by the increased material and labor costs associated with supporting   a larger number of installed   instruments.

During the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 201  6  , research and development expense increased by $  5.7   million, or   1  2  %, compared to the same period during 201  5  . The increase   of $5.7 million   in research and development expense was primarily attribut  able   to an increase of $  5.1   million for higher compensation related expenses resulting from increased headcount  .    Research and development expense included stock-based compensation expense of $  6.2   million and $  3.7   million during the   nine  -month periods ended   September   30,   2016 and   2015, respectively.  

We   anticipate that   our research and development expenses for the full year 2016   will be   higher than in 2015  , but such quarterly levels may vary   depending on the timing of   research and development projects among other factors. 

Sales, General and Administrative Expense 

During the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 201  6  , s  ales  , general and administrative expense increased by $  2  .  4   million, or   7  %, compared to the same period during 201  5  . The increase in sales, general and administrative expense   was primarily attribut  able   to an increase of   $3.3   million   for higher compensation related expenses resulting from increased headcount   and increased stock-based compensation  , par  tially offset by   a decrease of $0.8 million in facility expenses due to the rent   abatement   in 2016 in connection with our move to the O Brien Premises  .    Sales, general   and administrative expense included stock-based compensation expense of $  6.9   million and $  5.2   million during the   nine  -month periods ended   September   30,   2016 and   2015, respectively.  

We anticipate that our sales, general and administrative expenses for the   fiscal   y  ear of 2016 will be higher than   that of   2015, but such quarterly levels may vary depending on   the   timing of headcount increases among other factors and may   also   be affected by costs associated with the transition to our new headquarters in Menlo Park, California.  

Interest Expense 

Interest expense for the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 201  6     and 2015   related primarily to the debt facility entered into in February 2013.    

Liquidity   and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through product sales, issuance of common stock and convertible preferred stock, in addition to our debt facility and payments from Roche pursuant to the terms of the Roche Agreement. Cash, cash equivalent  s   and investments at   September   30  , 2016   totaled $  87.3   million, compared to $  82.3   million at December 31, 201  5  .   

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least 12 months; however, we   may need   to raise additional capital in the future. These expectations are based on our current operating and financing plans     which are subject to change. Factors that may affect our capital needs include, but are not limited to, slower than expected adoption of our products   resulting in lower sales of our products and services; future acquisitions; our ability to maintain new collaboration and customer arrangements; the progress of our research and development programs and our collaboration agreement with Roche; initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights;   the purchase of patent licenses; the costs associated with the transition to our new facilities in Menlo Park, California; and other factors. 

To the extent we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into

collaboration agreements on unattractive terms. Our inability to raise capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations 

Operating Activities 

Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for the development of ongoing product enhancements and future product manufacturing and sale of instruments and consumables, and support functions related to our s  ales  , general and administrative activities. The net cash used for the   nine  -month periods ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015 primarily reflects the net loss for those periods, partially offset by non-cash operating expenses including depreciation, stock-based compensation and also reflects changes in working capital. 

We used $  55.  0   million of cash from operating activities for the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016, compared to cash usage of $  47.2   million for the corresponding period in 2015. The cash used in operating activities for the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 was due primarily to a net loss of $  55.  3   million,   a reduction in deferred contractual revenue of $  10.8   million, an increase in accounts receivable of $  6.5   million and an increase in inventory of $  7.1   million,   partially offset by stock-based compensation of $  14.7   million   and   depreciation of $  2.8   million  .   

The cash used in operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 was due to a net loss of $30.3 million, a $15.0 million increase in prepaid and other assets related to the Landlord Payments associated with the Lease Amendment Agreement, a non-cash portion of gain on lease amendments of $3.0 million, a reduction in deferred contractual revenue of $10.8 million, and an increase in inventory of $2.0 million, partially offset by  stock-based compensation of $9.8 million and depreciation of $2.7 million..  

Investing Activities 

Our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and investment purchases and maturities.  

We   used $  21.  5   million of cash from investing activities for the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 compared to receiving   $  31.0   million of cash from investing activities for   the corresponding period in 2015. The cash used in investing activities for the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 was due primarily to net purchase of investments of $  16.0     million and   net   purchase of property and equipment   of $  5.  5   million.  

The receipt of cash of $31.0 million from investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 was due primarily to net maturities and sales of investments of $33.2 million  , partially offset by   net purchases of property and equipment of $2.1 million. 

Financing Activities 

We received   $6  5  .7 million and   $  6.9     million   of cash from financing activities during the   nine  -month periods ended   September   30,   2016 and   2015, respectively. 

The receipt of cash of $6  5  .7 million from financing activities during the   nine  -month period ended   September   30, 2016 was due primarily to net proceeds of $58.2 million from our common stock  at-the-market  offering program and $  7  .5 million from the issuance of common stock through our equity compensation plans.   As of   September   30, 2016,   no   shares of   common stock remained available for future sales through  at-the-market  offering  s  .   

The receipt of cash of $6.9 million from financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 was due primarily to $5.5 million from the issuance of common stock through our equity compensation plans and net proceeds of $1.4 million from our common stock  at-the-market  offering program. 

Capital Resources 

Common Stock  At-the-Market  Offering  

During April 2012, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC pursuant to which we could, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $150.0 million of our common stock,   preferred stock, depository shares,   warrants  , units   or debt securities. On May 1, 2012, the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC, which allowed us to access the capital markets for the three-year period following this effective date. 

On October 5, 2012, we entered into a sales agreement pursuant to which we sold shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of approximately $30.0 million through an  at-the-market  offering.  

On November 8, 2013, the sales agreement was amended to increase the shares of our common stock available for sale pursuant to the sales agreement, and, pursuant to such amendment, we sold additional   shares of our common stock for an   aggregate offering price of approximately $30.0 million.

In November 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $150 million of our common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, units or debt securities. On November 21, 2014, the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC, which will allow us to access the capital markets for the three-year period following the effective date.  

On February 3, 2015, the sales agreement was amended again in order to further increase the shares of our common stock available for sale pursuant to the sales agreement, and, pursuant to such amendment, we sold additional   shares of our common stock for an   aggregate offering price of approximately $30.0 million.  

On February 3, 2016  ,   we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, additional shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million under the sales agreement. Such aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock is in addition to the shares sold under the original sales agreement, dated October 5, 2012, the first amendment to such sales agreement, dated November 8, 2013, and amounts previously sold under the second amendment to such sales agreement, dated February 3, 2015.   Pursuant to such amendment, we sold additional   shares of our common stock for an   aggregate offering price of approximately $30.0 million.  

On May 18, 2016  ,   we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, additional shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million under the sales agreement. Pursuant to such amendment, we sold additional   shares of our common stock for an   aggregate offering price of approximately $30.0 million.  

We pay a commission equal to 3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under the sales agreement. We are not obligated to   sell s  hares of our common stock under the sales agreement. 

As of   September   30  , 2016,   no   common stock remained available   for future sales through   our   current    at-the-market  offering  s   to date  ;    however  ,   we may   need   to raise additional capital in the future   through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, including future  at-the-market      offerings. 

Debt Facility Agreement 

Under the terms of our February 2013 debt agreement with Deerfield (the  Facility Agreement ), we received $20.5 million and we issued promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $20.5 million (the  Notes ). The Notes bear simple interest at a rate of 8.75% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears commencing on April 1, 2013 and on the first business day of each January, April, July and October thereafter  . The Facility Agreement   has a maximum term of seven years. We received net proceeds of $20.0 million, representing $20.5 million of gross proceeds, less a $500,000 facility fee, before deducting other expenses of the transaction. 

The Facility Agreement also contains various representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, customary for financings of this type, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens on our assets, except as permitted under the Facility Agreement. In addition, the Facility Agreement requires us to maintain consolidated cash and cash equivalents on the last day of each calendar quarter of not less than $2.0 million. As security for our repayment of our obligations under the Facility Agreement, we granted a security interest in substantially all of our property and interests in property.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of   September   30  , 2016  ,   we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into standard indemnification arrangements. Pursuant to these arrangements, we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to its technology, or from claims relating to our performance or non-performance under a contract, any defective products supplied by us, or any negligent acts or omissions, or willful misconduct, committed by us or any of our employees, agents or representatives. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual after the execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable because it involves claims that may be made against us in future periods, but have not yet been made. To date, we have not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. 

We also enter and have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers that may require us to indemnify them against liabilities that arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, except as prohibited by applicable law. In addition, we may have obligations to hold harmless and indemnify third parties involved with our fund raising efforts and their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities related to claims arising against such parties pursuant to the terms of agreements entered into between   us and   such third parties in connection with such fund   raising efforts.   No additional liability associated   with such indemnification agreements has been recorded   as of   September   30  , 2016  .

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest R  ate and Market Risk 

Our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash, cash equivalents and investments, all of which have maturities of less than three years. The goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our goals, we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of   securities of   high credit quality. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged, are classified as available-for-sale, and are, due to their relatively short-term nature, subject to minimal interest rate risk. We currently do not hedge interest rate exposure. Because of the short-term maturities of our investments, we do not believe that   a hypothetical 10% change   in market   interest   rates would have any material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio. 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

The majority of our expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a portion of our operations consists of sales activities outside of the United States; therefore  ,   we have foreign exchange exposures relating to non-U.S. dollar revenues, operating expenses, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and currency balances. Our primary exposure is with the Euro.     Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the hypothetical gains and losses     based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposure  ; however, we do not believe that the effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements.    

Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures  . 

Disclosure Controls and P  rocedures 

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions   regarding required disclosure. 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control object  ives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource co  nstraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to t  heir costs  . 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial R  eportin  g 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September   30  , 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings  . 

On November 2, 2016, we filed a complaint against Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd., Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Inc. and Metrichor, Ltd. (together,  ONT ) with the U.S. International Trade Commission for patent infringement. We are seeking injunctive relief with respect to several ONT products including ONT s MinION and PromethION devices. The complaint is based on our U.S. Patent No. 9,404,146, entitled  Compositions and methods   for nucleic acid sequencing  which covers   novel   methods for sequencing single nucleic acid molecules using linked double-stranded nucleic acid templates, providing improved sequencing accuracy. We are seeking, among ot  her things, an exclusion order   permanently barring entry of infringing ONT products into the United States, and a cease and desist order preventing ONT from advertising and selling infringing products in the United States  .    The estimated financial effect associated with this complaint cannot be made as of this 10-Q filing time.  

From time to time, we may also be involved in a   variety of   other claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings relating to securities laws, product liability, patent infringement, contract disputes, employment and other matters that arise in the normal course of our business. In addition, third parties may, from time to time, assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We currently   do not   believe that the matters described above   will have a material adverse effect on our business; however, the results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of litigation and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

Item 1A.     Risk Factors 

You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

We have limited experience as a commercial company. 

Our first commercial product launched in 2011 and we have had limited sales to date. As such, we have limited historical financial data upon which to base our projected revenue, planned operating expenses or upon which to evaluate our company and our commercial prospects. Furthermore, in September 2015, we launched a new nucleic acid sequencing platform, the PacBio Sequel  System but have made only limited deliveries of the Sequel System to date. Based on our limited experience in developing and marketing new products, we may not be able to effectively: 

drive adoption of our current and future products, including the Sequel System;     

attract and retain customers for our products;     

provide appropriate levels of customer training and support for our products;     

implement an effective marketing strategy to promote awareness of our products;     

develop, manufacture and commercialize new products or achieve an acceptable return on our research and development efforts and expenses;     

comply with regulatory requirements applicable to our products;     

anticipate and adapt to changes in our market;     

maintain and develop strategic relationships with vendors and manufacturers to acquire necessary materials for the production of our existing or future products;     

scale our manufacturing activities to meet potential demand at a reasonable cost;     

avoid infringement and misappropriation of third-party intellectual property;     

obtain any necessary licenses to third-party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms;     

obtain valid and enforceable patents that give us a competitive advantage;     

protect our proprietary technology; and     

attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

In addition, a high percentage of our expenses is and will continue to be fixed. Accordingly, if we do not generate revenue as and when anticipated, our losses may be greater than expected and our operating results will suffer. 

We have incurred losses to date, and we expect to continue to incur significant losses as we develop our business and may never achieve profitability. 

We have incurred net losses since inception and we cannot be certain if or when we will produce sufficient revenue from our operations to support our costs. While we achieved profitability for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, this result was largely due to a one-time gain on lease amendments. We have incurred net losses for all other fiscal periods, and, even if profitability is achieved in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability on a consistent basis. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. 

If our products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient market acceptance, we will not generate expected revenue and our business may not succeed. 

We cannot be sure that our current or future products will gain acceptance in the marketplace at levels sufficient to support our costs. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the market for genetic analysis to include new applications that are not practicable with other current technologies. To accomplish this, we must successfully commercialize, and continue development of, our proprietary Single Molecule, Real-Time (  SMRT     ) Sequencing technology for use in a variety of life science and other applications, including uses by academic, government and clinical laboratories, as well as pharmaceutical, diagnostic, biotechnology and agriculture companies, among others. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing additional customers for our products. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that our products will be satisfactory to potential customers in the markets we seek to reach. These markets are new and dynamic, and there can be no assurance that they will develop as quickly as we anticipate, that they will reach their full potential or that they will be receptive to our recently-launched Sequel System. As a result, we may be required to refocus our marketing efforts, and we may have to make changes to the specifications of our products to enhance our ability to enter particular markets more quickly. Even if we are able to implement our technology successfully, we and/or our sales and distribution partners may fail to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our current or future products across the full range of our intended life science and other applications. If the market for our products grows more slowly than anticipated, if we are unable to successfully scale the manufacturing of new products to meet demand, if competitors develop better or more cost-effective products or if we are unable to further grow our customer base, our current and future sales and revenue would be materially harmed and our business may not succeed.  

If we are unable to successfully develop and timely manufacture our products, including Sequel Systems and related consumables, our business may be adversely affected. 

In light of the highly complex technologies involved in our products, there can be no assurance that we will be able to manufacture and commercialize our new products on a timely basis or continue providing adequate support for our existing products. The commercial success of the Sequel System depends on a number of factors, including performance and reliability of the system, our anticipating and effectively addressing customer preferences and demands, the success of our sales and marketing efforts, effective forecasting and management of product demand, purchase commitments and inventory levels, effective management of manufacturing and supply costs, and the quality of the Sequel System, including related consumables such as SMRT Cells and reagents. Should we face delays in or discover unexpected defects during the further development or manufacturing process of Sequel System instruments or consumables, including any delays or defects in software development or product functionality, the timing and success of the rollout of the Sequel System may be significantly impacted, which may materially and negatively impact our revenue and gross margin. The ability of our customers to successfully utilize the Sequel System will also depend on our ability to deliver high quality SMRT Cells and reagents. We have designed new SMRT Cells and other consumables for the Sequel System,   and our new SMRT Cells are being sourced from a prototype chip vendor. We are in the process of transferring SMRT Cell production to a high-volume manufacturer and may experience unanticipated delays or other issue  s.  Our production of the new SMRT Cells has initially been and may in the future be below desired levels and we have experienced and may experience in the future manufacturing delays, product defects and SMRT Cell variability, any of which could negatively impact our ability to sell Sequel Systems or result in other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The development of our products is complex and costly. Problems in the design or quality of our products may have a material and adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition, and operating results, and could result is us losing our certifications from the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ). If we were to lose ISO certification, then our customers, including Roche, might choose not to purchase products from us. Unanticipated problems with our products could divert substantial resources, which may impair our ability to support our new and existing products, and could substantially increase our costs. If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle, we may be forced to delay product shipments or the scaling of manufacturing or supply. In particular, if the continued rollout of the Sequel System is delayed or is not successful, we may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our substantial research and development

efforts, and our business may be materially and adversely affected. The expenses or losses associated with delayed or unsuccessful product development or lack of market acceptance of our new products could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

The development and commercialization of our current and future products, including those related to our arrangement with Roche, may not result in the benefits we anticipate, and any dispute with Roche could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We entered into the Roche Agreement with Roche in September 2013, pursuant to which we have been developing and expect to manufacture products for certain clinical research uses and ultimately for use in human   in vitro   diagnostics, including sequencing systems and consumables based on our proprietary SMRT Sequencing technology and our Sequel System. We are engaged in substantial and complex research and development efforts, which, if successful, may result in the introduction of new products in the future. Our research and development efforts are complex and require us to incur substantial expenses. We may not be able to develop and commercialize new products or achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our research and development efforts and expenses. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to develop and manufacture future products as provided by the terms of the Roche Agreement or that Roche will choose or be able to commercialize and sell the products we develop or supply under the Roche Agreement. We could also be involved in disputes with Roche, which could lead to delays in or termination of our development and manufacture of products under the Roche Agreement, and result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. In addition, any such dispute could diminish Roche s commitment to us and reduce the resources they devote to commercializing the products developed or supplied under the Roche Agreement. If Roche terminates or breaches the Roche Agreement, or otherwise acquires, develops and/or commercializes alternative or competing products or services, the successful commercialization of our products for clinical uses would be materially and adversely affected. 

Furthermore, we anticipate that Roche may account for a significant percentage of our total revenue in the future if they commercialize products developed or supplied under the Roche Agreement. As a consequence, our customer base may be concentrated and Roche s purchasing behavior could cause our quarterly revenue and results of operations to be materially impacted and to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For example, any cancellation of orders or any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by Roche could materially affect our revenue and results of operations in any quarterly period. In such circumstances, the loss of Roche as   a   customer, or a significant delay or reduction in its purchases, could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

We must successfully manage new product introductions and transitions, we may incur significant costs during these transitions, and they may not result in the benefits we anticipate.    

If our products and services fail to deliver the performance or results expected by our current and future customers, or are not delivered on a timely basis, our reputation and credibility may suffer, our current and future sales and revenue may be materially harmed and our business may not succeed. For instance, if we are not able to realize the benefits we anticipate from the development and commercialization of the Sequel System or our future products, including the expected benefits from the Roche Agreement, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the introduction of the Sequel System and other future products may lead to our limiting or ceasing development of further enhancements to our existing products as we focus our resources on the new products, and could result in reduced marketplace acceptance and loss of sales of our existing products, materially adversely affecting our revenue and operating results. The introduction of new products, such as the Sequel System, may also have a negative impact on our revenue in the near-term as our current and future customers may delay or cancel orders of existing products in anticipation of new products and we may also be pressured to decrease prices for our existing products. Further, we could experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions, purchasing decisions or transition requirements with respect to newly-launched products, such as the Sequel System. We could incur significant costs in completing the transition,   including costs of inventory write-downs of our products  , as current or future customers transition to the new Sequel System. If we do not successfully manage this product transition, our business, reputation and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 

We rely on other companies for the manufacture of certain components and sub-assemblies and intend to outsource additional sub-assemblies in the future. We may not be able to successfully scale the manufacturing process necessary to build and test multiple products on a full commercial basis, which could materially harm our business.  

Our products are complex and involve a large number of unique components, many of which require precision in manufacturing. The nature of our products requires customized components that are currently available only from a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources. We have chosen to source certain critical components from a single source, including suppliers for our SMRT Cells, reagents and instruments. Furthermore, we are in the process of transferring production of the SMRT Cells for our Sequel System to a high-volume manufacturer and may experience unanticipated delays or other issues in connection with such transition. If we are required to purchase these components from alternative sources, it could take several months or longer

to qualify the alternative sources. If we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components on a timely basis, or if these components do not meet our expectations or specifications for quality and functionality, our operations and manufacturing will be materially and adversely affected, we could be unable to meet customer demand and our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

The operations of our third-party manufacturing partners and suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations or that are beyond our control. If our manufacturing partners or suppliers are unable or fail to fulfill their obligations to us for any reason, we may not be able to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand or our obligations under sales agreements, including the Roche Agreement, in a timely manner, and our business could be harmed as a result. Our current manufacturing process is characterized by long lead times between the placement of orders for and delivery of our products. If we have ordered insufficient components to manufacture our products on a timely basis to meet customer demand, our sales and our gross margin may be adversely affected and our business could be materially harmed. If we are unable to reduce our manufacturing costs and establish and maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing suppliers as we scale our operations, our business could be materially harmed. 

We may be unable to consistently manufacture our instruments and consumable kits, including SMRT Cells, to the necessary specifications or in quantities necessary to meet demand at an acceptable cost. 

In order to successfully generate revenue from our products, we need to supply our customers with products that meet their expectations for quality and functionality in accordance with established specifications. Our customers have previously experienced variability in the performance of our instruments and SMRT Cells. Moreover, we are manufacturing a new version of our SMRT Cells for the Sequel System. Our production of the new SMRT Cells has initially been and may in the future be below desired levels and we have experienced and may experience in the future manufacturing delays, product defects and SMRT Cell variability, especially as we transfer production of our SMRT Cells to a high-volume manufacturer. There is no assurance that we will be able to manufacture our products so that they consistently achieve the product specifications and quality that our customers expect, including those products and specifications that may be developed pursuant to the Roche Agreement. Problems in the design or quality of our products may have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition, and operating results, and could result is us losing our ISO certifications. If we were to lose our ISO certification, then our customers, including Roche, might choose not to purchase products from us. There is also no assurance that we will be able to increase manufacturing yields and decrease costs, or that we will be successful in forecasting customer demand or manufacturing and supply costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to increase manufacturing to meet anticipated demand. An inability to manufacture products and components that consistently meet specifications, in necessary quantities and at commercially acceptable costs, will have a negative impact, and may have an material adverse effect, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Rapidly changing technology in life sciences and diagnostics could make our products obsolete unless we continue to develop and commercialize new and improved products and pursue new market opportunities. 

Our industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend on our ability to continually improve our products, to develop and introduce new products that address the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis and to pursue new market opportunities. These new market opportunities may be outside the scope of our proven expertise or in areas where the market demand is unproven, and new products and services developed by us may not gain market acceptance. Our inability to develop and introduce new products and to gain market acceptance of the Sequel System and other new products could harm our future operating results. Unanticipated difficulties or delays in replacing existing products with new products or in commercializing the Sequel System or other new or improved products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand could diminish future demand for our products and harm our future operating results. 

Increased market adoption of our products by customers may depend on the availability of sample preparation and informatics tools, some of which may be developed by third parties. 

Our commercial success may depend in part upon the development of sample preparation and software and informatics tools by third parties for use with our products. We cannot guarantee that third parties will develop tools that our current and future customers will find useful with our products. A lack of complementary sample preparation and informatics tools may impede the adoption of our products and may materially and adversely impact our business. 

We operate in a highly competitive industry and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will likely be harmed. 

Some of our current competitors, including Illumina, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., as well as other potential competitors, have greater name recognition, more substantial intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, significantly  

29   

Table of Contents  

greater financial, technical, research and/or other resources, more experience in new product development, larger and more established manufacturing capabilities and marketing, sales and support functions, and/or more established distribution channels to deliver products to customers than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In light of these advantages, even if our technology is more effective than the products or service offerings of our competitors, current and potential customers might purchase competitive products and services instead of our products. There are also several companies in the process of developing new, potentially competing technologies, products and/or services,   including     Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd., against whom we have filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission for patent infringement.   Increased competition may result in pricing pressures, which could harm our sales, profitability or market share. Our failure to further enhance our existing products and to introduce new products to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.    

We may be unable to successfully increase sales of our products. 

Our ability to achieve profitability depends on our ability to attract customers for our current and future products, and we may be unable to effectively market our products. To perform sales, marketing, distribution and customer support functions successfully, we face a number of risks, including: 

our ability to attract, retain and manage the sales, marketing and service personnel necessary to expand market acceptance for our technologies;     

the time and cost of maintaining and growing a specialized sales, marketing and service force for a particular application, which may be difficult to justify in light of the revenue generated; and     

our sales, marketing and service force may be unable to execute successful commercial activities.     

We have enlisted and may continue to enlist third parties to assist with sales, distribution and customer support. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in attracting desirable sales and distribution partners or that we will be able to enter into arrangements with such partners on terms favorable to us. If our sales and marketing efforts, or those of any of our third-party sales and distribution partners, are not successful, our technologies and products may not gain market acceptance, which could materially impact our business operations. 

We may need to raise additional financing to fund our existing operations. Equity and debt securities we issue may have rights senior to common stockholders and additional equity financing will dilute the holdings of current stockholders.  

We may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all, particularly in light of restrictions under our debt agreement. We have incurred and may further incur additional debt. Debt holders have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets and the terms of our existing debt agreement restrict certain activities, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Fundraising through sales of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities will have a dilutive effect on our existing investors. 

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. 

Our net losses since inception and our expectation of incurring substantial losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future, combined with our existing indebtedness, could:  

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including under   our existing   debt agreement;     

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;     

limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and other business opportunities;     

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our indebtedness;     

increase the volatility of the price of our common stock;     

limit our flexibility to react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;     

place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less or no indebtedness; and     

limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.     

Our existing debt contains covenants which may adversely impact our business and our failure to comply with such covenants could cause our outstanding indebtedness to become immediately payable. 

Our existing debt contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries  ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens on our assets. These covenants impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take certain actions that may be in our best interests. 

30   

Table of Contents  

A breach of any of the covenants contained in our debt could result in an event of default. If an event of default exists, debt holders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the debt to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable, debt holders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our property and interests in property, including our intellectual property, as collateral under our existing debt. If the debt holders accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayment, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our business. 

In addition, at the election of the holders representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes issued pursuant to our existing debt agreement, the holders may elect to receive 25% of the net proceeds from any financing that includes an equity component, including, without limitation, the sale or issuance of our common stock, options, warrants or other securities convertible or exchangeable for shares of our common stock, as partial payment of the notes. This right is subject to certain exceptions set forth in our existing debt agreement. To the extent we raise additional capital in the future through the sale of common stock under any future  at-the-market  offering or through other financing activities, we may be obligated, at the election of the holders of the notes, to pay 25% of the net proceeds from any such financing activities as partial payment of the notes. 

Our products are highly complex, have recurring support requirements and could have unknown defects or errors, which may give rise to claims against us or divert application of our resources from other purposes. 

Products using our SMRT Sequencing technology are highly complex and may develop or contain undetected defects or errors. Our customers have in the past experienced reliability issues with our existing products, and we have only recently launched the Sequel System, such that support costs are difficult to predict. Despite testing, defects or errors may arise in our products, which could result in a failure to maintain or increase market acceptance of our products, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation and increased warranty, service and maintenance costs. New products or enhancements to our existing products in particular may contain undetected errors or performance problems that are discovered only after delivery to customers. If our products have reliability or other quality issues or require unexpected levels of support in the future, the market acceptance and utilization of our products may not grow to levels sufficient to support our costs and our reputation and business could be harmed. We generally ship our sequencing instruments with one year of service included in the purchase price with an option to purchase one or more additional years of service. We also provide a warranty for our consumables, which is generally limited to replacing, or at our option, giving credit for any consumable with defects in material or workmanship. Defects or errors in our products may also discourage customers from purchasing our products. The costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our operating margins. If our service and support costs increase, our business and operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

In addition, such defects or errors could lead to the filing of product liability claims against us or against third parties who we may have an obligation to indemnify against such claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend and result in substantial damages. Although we have product liability insurance, any product liability insurance that we have or procure in the future may not protect our business from the financial impact of a product liability claim. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable terms. Any insurance that we have or obtain will be subject to deductibles and coverage limits. A product liability claim could have a serious adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We depend on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. If we lose members of our senior management team or other key personnel or are unable to successfully retain, recruit and train qualified scientists, engineers and other personnel, our ability to develop our products could be harmed and we may be unable to achieve our goals. 

Our future success depends upon the continuing services of members of our senior management team and scientific and engineering personnel. In particular, our scientists and engineers are critical to our future technological and product innovations and we will need to hire additional qualified personnel. Our industry, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, and the turnover rate can be high. We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies, academic institutions and research institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics. Our employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice and would be free to work for a competitor. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all, and other senior management may be required to divert attention from other aspects of the business. In addition, we do not have  key person  life insurance policies covering any member of our management team or other key personnel. The loss of any of these individuals or any inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, including scientists, engineers and others, could prevent us from pursuing collaborations and materially and adversely affect our product development and introductions, business growth prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

A significant portion of our potential sales depends on customers  spending budgets that may be subject to significant and unexpected variation which could have a negative effect on the demand for our products. 

Our instruments represent significant capital expenditures for our customers. Potential customers for our current or future products include academic and government institutions, genome centers, medical research institutions, clinical laboratories, pharmaceutical, agricultural, biotechnology, diagnostic and chemical companies. Their spending budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Spending budgets are based on a wide variety of factors, including the allocation of available resources to make purchases, funding from government sources which is highly uncertain, the spending priorities among various types of research equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures during economically uncertain periods. Any decrease in capital spending or change in spending priorities of our current and potential customers could significantly reduce the demand for our products. Any delay or reduction in purchases by potential customers or our inability to forecast fluctuations in demand could harm our future operating results. 

We may not be able to convert our orders in backlog into revenue. 

Our backlog represents product orders from our customers that we have confirmed and for which we have not yet recognized revenue. We may not receive revenue from these orders, and the order backlog we report may not be indicative of our future revenue. 

Many events can cause an order to be delayed or not completed at all, some of which may be out of our control. If we delay fulfilling customer orders or if customers reconsider their orders, those customers may seek to cancel or modify their orders with us. Customers may otherwise seek to cancel or delay their orders even if we are prepared to fulfill them. If our orders in backlog do not result in sales, our operating results may suffer. 

Delivery of our products could be delayed or disrupted by factors beyond our control, and we could lose customers as a result. 

We rely on third-party carriers for the timely delivery of our products. As a result, we are subject to carrier disruptions and increased costs that are beyond our control. Any failure to deliver products to our customers in a safe and timely manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose customers. If our relationship with any of these third-party carriers is terminated or impaired or if any of these carriers are unable to deliver our products, the delivery and acceptance of our products by our customers may be delayed, which could harm our business and financial results. The failure to deliver our products in a safe and timely manner may harm our relationship with our customers, increase our costs and otherwise disrupt our operations. 

We are, and may become, subject to governmental regulations that may impose burdens on our operations, and the markets for our products may be narrowed. 

We are subject, both directly and indirectly, to the adverse impact of government regulation of our operations and markets. For example, export of our instruments may be subject to strict regulatory control in a number of jurisdictions. The failure to satisfy export control criteria or to obtain necessary clearances could delay or prevent shipment of products, which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Moreover, the life sciences industry, which is expected to be one of the primary markets for our technology, has historically been heavily regulated. There are, for example, laws in several jurisdictions restricting research in genetic engineering, which may narrow our markets. Given the evolving nature of this industry, legislative bodies or regulatory authorities may adopt additional regulations that may adversely affect our market opportunities. Additionally, if ethical and other concerns surrounding the use of genetic information, diagnostics or therapies become widespread, there may be less demand for our products.  

Our business is also directly affected by a wide variety of government regulations applicable to business enterprises generally and to companies operating in the life science industry in particular. Failure to comply with government regulations or obtain or maintain necessary permits and licenses could result in a variety of fines or other censures or an interruption in our business operations which may have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenue and the cost of operating our business. 

Our products could in the future be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other domestic and international regulatory agencies, which could increase our costs and delay our commercialization efforts, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations. 

Our products are not currently subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) clearance or approval since they are not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of disease. However, in the future, certain of our products or related applications, or those developed or supplied pursuant to our agreement with Roche, could be subject to FDA regulation, or the FDA s regulatory jurisdiction could be expanded to include our products. Even where a product is exempted from FDA clearance or approval, the FDA may impose restrictions as to the types of customers to which we or our partners can market and sell our products. Such regulation and restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Many countries have laws and regulations that could affect our products. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. Unlike many of our competitors, this is an area where we do not have expertise. We, or our other third-party sales and distribution partners, may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such countries or may incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals. In addition, the export by us of certain of our products, which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution, may be subject to FDA or other export restrictions. 

Doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our business. 

We currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions. Conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources. If we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. International operations entail a variety of risks, including challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, tariffs and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which we sell our products, including as a result of the recent referendum held in the United Kingdom on its membership in the European Union (the outcome of which was a vote on favor of leaving the European Union), difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery delays and significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws. In conducting our international operations, we will be subject to U.S. laws relating to our international activities, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as well as foreign laws relating to our activities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. Failure to comply with these laws may subject us to financial and/or other penalties in the United States and/or foreign countries that could materially and adversely impact our operations or financial condition. 

Changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market. Our revenue from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the U.S. dollar relative to our international customers  local currencies could make our products more expensive, impacting our ability to compete     or as a result of financial or other instability in such locations which could result in decreased sales of our products. Our costs of materials from international suppliers may also increase as the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to their local currency. Foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations. Such actions may materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 

If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our business and our stock price. 

Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be evaluated frequently. We may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. Operating as a public company requires sufficient resources within the accounting and finance functions in order to produce timely financial information, ensure the level of segregation of duties, and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting customary for a U.S. public company. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company will have been detected. 

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we perform periodic evaluations of our internal control over financial reporting. While we have in the past performed this evaluation and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was operating effectively, there can be no assurance that in the future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered. In addition, if we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth. 

Our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to substantial limitations. 

Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an  ownership change  is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses ( NOLs ) to offset future taxable income. We believe that we  

33   

Table of Contents  

have had one or more ownership changes, as a result of which our existing NOLs are currently subject to limitation. Future changes in our stock ownership could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382. We may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs even if we attain profitability.  

Our sales cycle is unpredictable and lengthy, which makes it difficult to forecast revenue and may increase the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results. 

The sales cycle for our sequencing instruments is lengthy because they represent a major capital expenditure and generally require the approval of our customers  senior management. This may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly during the periods in which our sales volume is low. Because of these fluctuations, it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. Past fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have resulted in decreases in our stock price. Such fluctuations also mean that investors may not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance. Sales to existing customers and the establishment of a business relationship with other potential customers is a lengthy process, generally taking several months and sometimes longer. Following the establishment of the relationship, the negotiation of purchase terms can be time-consuming, and a potential customer may require an extended evaluation and testing period. We cannot be sure what the sales cycle will be for the Sequel System. In anticipation of product orders, we may incur substantial costs before the sales cycle is complete and before we receive any customer payments. As a result, in the event that a sale is not completed or is canceled or delayed, we may have incurred substantial expenses, making it more difficult for us to become profitable or otherwise negatively impacting our financial results. Furthermore, because of our lengthy sales cycle, the realization of revenue from our selling efforts may be substantially delayed, our ability to forecast our future revenue may be more limited and our revenue may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.  

Moreover, in previous quarters, we recognized substantial revenue derived from milestone payments under the Roche Agreement. All of the milestones under the Roche Agreement have now been achieved, however, which may significantly affect our quarterly operating results in fiscal 2016, particularly during the periods in which our sales volume is low. As a result, it is possible that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.  

Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental, health and safety laws, which can be expensive and may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and some of our products include hazardous materials. Accordingly, we are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and permits relating to environmental, health and safety matters, including, among others, those governing the use, storage, handling, exposure to and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the health and safety of our employees, and the shipment, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of products containing hazardous materials. Liability under environmental laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. For example, under certain circumstances and under certain environmental laws, we could be held liable for costs relating to contamination at our or our predecessors  past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. We could also be held liable for damages arising out of human exposure to hazardous materials. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, property damage and personal injury claims, investigations, the suspension of production or product sales, loss of permits or a cessation of operations. Any of these events could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We also expect that our operations will be affected by new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations on an ongoing basis, or more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations. New laws or changes to existing laws may result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how we manufacture them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Our facilities in California are located near earthquake faults, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment, which could require us to cease or curtail operations. 

Our facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area are located near earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fire, floods, power loss, communications failures and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities would be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired. In addition, the nature of our activities could cause significant delays in our research programs and commercial activities and make it difficult for us to recover from a disaster. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions. Accordingly, an earthquake or other disaster could materially and adversely harm our ability to conduct business.

Our ability to successfully manage our transition to our new headquarters could result in a material adverse effect on our business or operations if we underestimate the costs of the transition, experience delays or quality issues with our manufacturing, or if internal measures to mitigate these risks are not effective. 

We are in the process of transitioning to our new headquarters in Menlo Park, California. The successful transition of our headquarters, including the transition of our manufacturing facilities, is largely dependent upon the cooperation and continued performance of both our current and future landlords, as well as third-party contractors who are preparing certain shell improvements and tenant improvements. During the transition period, we must establish procedures to ensure that our current and future manufacturing facilities meet our quality standards while maintaining a reasonable cost structure. In addition, after our new manufacturing facilities have been qualified, it may take a considerable period of time to commence volume production. We have already devoted significant expenses and resources in connection with the transition, and there is no assurance that we can manage the transition successfully. If the transition does not go as expected, in addition to other issues noted above, we could experience delayed shipments of products, unexpected cost overruns or quality issues, or loss of our ISO certifications, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and business reputation.     In addition, in the event that we breach any of our current Menlo Park facility real property leases and fail to cure such breach within the time permitted, the landlord would have no obligation to make the final payment due to us under the leases, as amended, as consideration for our agreement to amend the leases. 

Ethical, legal, privacy and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our technology. 

Our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans, agricultural crops and other living organisms. The information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications which may have underlying ethical, legal, privacy and social concerns, including the genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing for genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions. Governmental authorities could, for safety, social or other purposes, call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing. Such concerns or governmental restrictions could limit the use of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Disruption of critical information technology systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business, customer relations and financial condition. 

Information technology ( IT ) helps us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiently and accurately produce our financial statements. IT systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including sales forecast, order fulfillment and billing, customer service, logistics, and management of data from running samples on our products. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, power loss, natural disasters, human acts, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, disruption of our operations, which could harm our reputation and financial results. 

If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper IT infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions or loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. 

Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. 

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our IT infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other disruptions. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other persons into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our IT systems. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation, which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.

Regulations related to conflict minerals will cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products. 

We are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that require us to conduct diligence, and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. Furthermore, the complex nature of our products requires components and materials that may be available only from a limited number of sources and, in some cases, from only a single source. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to components, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. We may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to alter our processes or sources of supply to avoid using such materials. Reputational harm could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 

Failure to secure patent or other intellectual property protection for our products and improvements to our products may reduce our ability to maintain any technological or competitive advantage over our current and potential competitors. 

Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is uncertain and depends on complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties. For example:  

we or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or issued patents;     

we or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;     

it is possible that neither our pending patent applications nor the pending patent applications of our licensors will result in issued patents;     

the scope of the patent protection we or our licensors obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies, developing competing products, designing around our patented technologies or independently developing similar or alternative technologies;     

our and our licensors  patent applications or patents have been, are and may in the future be, subject to interference, opposition or similar administrative proceedings, which could result in those patent applications failing to issue as patents, those patents being held invalid or the scope of those patents being substantially reduced;     

we or our partners may not adequately protect our trade secrets;     

we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or     

the patents of others may limit our freedom to operate and prevent us from commercializing our technology in accordance with our plans.     

The occurrence of any of these events could impair our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others or prevent us from establishing or maintaining a competitive advantage over our competitors. 

Variability in intellectual property laws may adversely affect our intellectual property position. 

Intellectual property laws, and patent laws and regulations in particular, have been subject to significant variability either through administrative or legislative changes to such laws or regulations or changes or differences in judicial interpretation, and it is expected that such variability will continue to occur. Additionally, intellectual property laws and regulations differ by country. Variations in the patent laws and regulations or in interpretations of patent laws and regulations in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and may change the impact of third-party intellectual property on us. Accordingly, we cannot predict the scope of the patents that may be granted to us with certainty, the extent to which we will be able to enforce our patents against third parties or the extent to which third parties may be able to enforce their patents against us. 

Some of the intellectual property that is important to our business is owned by other companies or institutions and licensed to us, and changes to the rights we have licensed may adversely impact our business. 

We license from third parties some of the intellectual property that is important to our business. If we fail to meet our obligations under these licenses, these third parties could terminate the licenses. If the third parties who license intellectual property to us fail to maintain the intellectual property that we have licensed, or lose rights to that intellectual property, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated, which could subject us to claims of intellectual property infringement. Termination of these  

36   

Table of Contents  

licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms, or could subject us to claims of intellectual property infringement in litigation or other administrative proceedings that could result in damage awards against us and injunctions that could prohibit us from selling our products. In addition, some of our licenses from third parties limit the field in which we can use the licensed technology. Therefore, in order for us to use such licensed technology in potential future applications that are outside the licensed field of use, we may be required to negotiate new licenses with our licensors or expand our rights under our existing licenses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such licenses or expanded rights on reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we have limited rights to participate in the prosecution and enforcement of the patents and patent applications that we have licensed. As a result, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. Further, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, we may need to rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms. The occurrence of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

The measures that we use to protect the security of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate, which could result in the loss of legal protection for, and thereby diminish the value of, such intellectual property and other rights. 

In addition to patents, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements, and by entering into confidentiality agreements with our third-party development, manufacturing, sales and distribution partners, who may also acquire, develop and/or commercialize alternative or competing products or provide services to our competitors. For example, Roche has certain access to our trade secrets and other proprietary information pursuant to the Roche Agreement, subject to the confidentiality provisions thereof; however, Roche has also developed and commercialized its 454 Life Sciences sequencing systems and is developing alternative and potentially competing sequencing products through its acquisition of Genia Technologies. There can be no assurance that our measures will provide adequate protection for our intellectual property and proprietary information. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be disclosed to others, or others may gain access to or disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Additionally, others may independently develop proprietary information and techniques that are substantially equivalent to ours. The occurrence of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our intellectual property may be subject to challenges in the United States or foreign jurisdictions that could adversely affect our intellectual property position. 

Our pending, issued and granted U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications have been, are and may in the future be, subject to challenges by third parties asserting prior invention by others or invalidity on various grounds, through proceedings, such as interferences, reexamination or opposition proceedings. Addressing these challenges to our intellectual property has been, and any future challenges can be, costly and distract management s attention and resources. For example, we previously incurred significant legal expenses to litigate and settle a complaint seeking review of a patent interference decision of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Additionally, as a result of these challenges, our patents or pending patent applications may be determined to be unpatentable to us, invalidated or unenforceable in whole or in part. Accordingly, adverse rulings in these proceedings may negatively impact the scope of our intellectual property protection for our products and technology, and may materially and adversely affect our business. 

Some of our technology is subject to  march-in  rights by the U.S. government. 

Some of our patented technology was developed with U.S. federal government funding. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise  march-in  rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that such action is necessary to (i) achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, (ii) alleviate health or safety needs, (iii) meet requirements of federal regulations, or (iv) give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government and such government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications. Furthermore, our rights in such inventions are subject to government license rights and foreign manufacturing restrictions.

We are involved in legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights. 

Our intellectual property rights involve complex factual, scientific and legal questions. We operate in an industry characterized by significant intellectual property litigation. Even though we may believe that we have a valid patent on a particular     technology, other companies may have from time to time taken, and may in the future take, actions that we believe violate our patent rights  . For example, we have filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission against Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd. for patent infringement.   Legal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time and resources and adverse parties may bring claims against us and/or our intellectual property. Our enforcement actions may not be successful, could give rise to legal claims against us and could result in some of our intellectual property rights being determined to be invalid or not enforceable.  

We could in the future be subject to legal proceedings with third parties who may claim that our products infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. 

Our products are based on complex, rapidly developing technologies. We may not be aware of issued or previously filed patent applications that belong to third parties that mature into issued patents that cover some aspect of our products or their use. In addition, because patent litigation is complex and the outcome inherently uncertain, our belief that our products do not infringe third-party patents of which we are aware or that such third-party patents are invalid and unenforceable may be determined to be incorrect. As a result, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, that we infringe their patent rights and have filed, and may in the future file, lawsuits or engage in other proceedings against us to enforce their patent rights. In addition, as we enter new markets, our competitors and other third parties may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our ability to develop further, commercialize, or sell products or services, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. Patent litigation between competitors in our industry is common. Additionally, we have certain obligations to many of our customers and suppliers to indemnify and defend them against claims by third parties that our products or their use infringe any intellectual property of these third parties. In defending ourselves against any of these claims, we have in the past incurred, and could in the future incur, substantial costs, and the attention of our management and technical personnel could be diverted. For example, we previously incurred significant legal expenses to litigate and settle a complaint alleging patent infringement. Even if we have an agreement that indemnifies us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. To avoid or settle legal claims, it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more products or relating to current or future technologies, which could negatively affect our gross margins. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may be unable to modify our products so that they do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some situations, the results of litigation or settlement of claims may require us to cease allegedly infringing activities which could prevent us from selling some or all of our products. The occurrence of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

In addition, in the course of our business, we may from time to time have access or be alleged to have access to confidential or proprietary information of others, which, though not patented, may be protected as trade secrets. Others could bring claims against us asserting that we improperly used their confidential or proprietary information, or that we misappropriated their technologies and incorporated those technologies into our products. A determination that we illegally used the confidential or proprietary information or misappropriated technologies of others in our products could result in us paying substantial damage awards or being prevented from selling some or all of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 

We have not yet registered some of our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. 

Some of our trademark applications may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. In addition, in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. 

Our use of  open source  software could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation. 

A portion of our products or technologies developed and/or distributed by us incorporate  open source  software, and we may incorporate open source software into other products or technologies in the future. Some open source software licenses require that we disclose the source code for any modifications to such open source software that we make and distribute to one or more third parties, and that we license the source code for such modifications to third parties, including our competitors, at no cost. We monitor the use of open source software in our products to avoid uses in a manner that would require us to disclose or grant licenses under our source code that we wish to maintain as proprietary; however, there can be no assurance that such efforts have been or will be  

38   

Table of Contents  

successful. In some circumstances, distribution of our software that includes or is linked with open source software could require that we disclose and license some or all of our proprietary source code in that software, which could include permitting the use of such software and source code at no cost to the user. Open source license terms are often ambiguous and there is little legal precedent governing the interpretation of these licenses. Successful claims made by the licensors of open source software that we have violated the terms of these licenses could result in unanticipated obligations, including being subject to significant damages, being enjoined from distributing products that incorporate open source software and being required to make available our proprietary source code pursuant to an open source license, which could substantially help our competitors develop products that are similar to or better than ours or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business. 

Risks Related to Owning Our Common Stock 

The price of our common stock has been, is, and may continue to be, highly volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid to acquire them. 

The market price of our common stock is highly volatile, and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including: 

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;     

announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;     

announcements by our customers, partners or suppliers relating directly or indirectly to our products, services or technologies;     

overall conditions in our industry and market;     

addition or loss of significant customers;     

changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products;     

actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;     

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or achievement of significant milestones;     

additions or departures of key personnel;     

competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;     

issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;     

fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;     

disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters or our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our technologies;     

announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;     

sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;     

stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;     

reports, guidance and ratings issued by securities or industry analysts; and     

general economic and market conditions.     

If any of the forgoing occurs, it would cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Stock markets in general and the market for companies in our industry in particular have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been a party to this type of litigation in the past and may be the target of this type of litigation again in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. 

Future sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall. 

We maintain a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $150 million of our common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, units or debt securities. We have established, and may in the future establish,  at-the-market  offerings pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock. Sales of securities under the registration statement have resulted and will continue to result in dilution of our   existing   stockholders, and such sales could cause our stock price to fall.  

In addition, if our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market, it could cause our stock price to fall. W  e may also issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common  

39   

Table of Contents  

stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause   our stock price to fall  .   

Concentration of ownership by our principal stockholders may result in control by such stockholders of the composition of our board of directors. 

Our existing significant stockholders, executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own a significant number of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. 

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock. 

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that: 

authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and up to approximately 1,000,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued shares of common stock;     

require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;     

specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President;     

establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;     

establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered terms;     

provide that our directors may be removed only for cause; and     

provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.     

These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. 

Our development agreement with Roche may deter or reduce the number of potential acquirers thus reducing or placing negative pressure on our stock price. 

The Roche Agreement could make an acquisition of us less likely, whether or not we realize the expected benefits from the Roche Agreement. For example, the exclusive rights and licenses granted to Roche pursuant to the Roche Agreement, or our development, manufacturing and supply obligations pursuant to the Roche Agreement, may make an acquisition of us less appealing to third parties that compete with Roche. 

Our large number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock may potentially dilute existing stockholders  stockholdings. 

We have a significant number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Our board of directors may issue shares of common stock from this authorized but unissued pool from time to time without stockholder approval, resulting in the dilution of our existing stockholders. 

We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 

We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our existing debt agreement restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any  

40   

Table of Contents  

determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.
