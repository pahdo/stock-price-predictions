1.      NATURE
                                         OF OPERATIONS     

Intelligent
Cloud Resources Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated on March 27, 2014 in the state of Nevada. The Company is engaged
in providing IT solutions and Cloud based services. The Company s principal place of business is located at 8717 N. Mattox
Rd., C198, Kansas City, MO 64154.  

2.      GOING
                                         CONCERN     

These
condensed interim financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue on a going concern basis. The Company
has incurred losses since inception and the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to
develop profitable operations and to continue to raise adequate financing. In order for the Company to meet its liabilities as
they become due and to continue its operations, the Company is solely dependent upon its ability to generate such financing.  

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise funds, in which case the Company may be unable to meet
its obligations. Should the Company be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business,
the net realizable value of its assets may be materially less than the amounts recorded in these condensed interim financial statements.  

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence.   

3.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

Basis
of Presentation   

The
Company s unaudited condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations
of the SEC. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed interim financial statements do not include all information and footnotes required
by US GAAP for complete annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed interim
financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair
presentation. Interim operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December
31, 2016 or for any other interim period. The unaudited condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the audited financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
Company s fiscal year-end is December 31. The Company s functional currency is Canadian ( CDN ) dollars.
The Company s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar.

3.      SUMMARY
                                         OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)     

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the condensed interim financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed interim financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Areas involving significant estimates and assumptions include accruals, going concern assessment, valuation of embedded
derivatives within convertible promissory notes and valuation allowance for deferred tax asset. These estimates are reviewed periodically,
and, as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known. Actual results could
materially differ from those estimates .   

Revenue
recognition   

Revenues
from services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been performed, the amount is
fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards   

The
Company evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued and determined that the adoption of these pronouncements would not
have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  

4.      CONVERTIBLE
                                         PROMISSORY NOTES     

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into convertible promissory note agreements (the  Agreements )
with certain investors (referred to as the  the Holders  or  Mini Investors ), whereby the Company issued
Convertible Notes (the  Convertible Notes  or  Notes ) in various principal amounts. The notes would bear
an interest rate of 10% per annum. Under the convertible note agreements, the lender had the right to convert all or any
part of the outstanding and unpaid principal and interest into shares of the Company s common stock; provided however, that
in no event shall the lender be entitled to convert any portion of the notes that would result in the beneficial ownership by
it and its affiliates to be more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. The lender exercised this
right on September 30, 2016.

4.      CONVERTIBLE
                                         PROMISSORY NOTES (continued)     

The
key terms/features of the Mini Investors Convertible Notes were as follows:  

1.    The
                                         Holders had the right from and after the date of issuance, and until any time the Notes
                                         are fully paid, to convert any outstanding and unpaid principal portion of the Notes,
                                         and accrued interest (10% rate), into fully paid and non assessable shares of Common
                                         Stock (par value $.0001).    

2.    The
                                         Notes were convertible at a fixed conversion price of $0.50 or upon default, the lessor
                                         of fixed conversion price $0.25 and 100% of 10 trading day low VWAP (default condition).    

3.    Beneficial
                                         ownership is limited to 4.99% initially and upon the Holders request to 9.99%.    

4.    The
                                         Notes could be prepaid in whole or in part, at any time during the period beginning on
                                         the issue date and ending on the date which is maturity, beginning at 100% of the outstanding
                                         principal, accrued interest and certain other amounts that may be due and owing under
                                         the Notes.    

5.    In
                                         the event of default the Convertible Notes would bear interest at 10% per annum and a
                                         0% penalty rate.    

These
Convertible Notes, together with interest accrued on these notes, were converted into 633,332 shares of the Company on September
30, 2016.  

Outstanding
convertible promissory notes as at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:  

The
embedded conversion features and reset feature in the notes were accounted for as a derivative liability based on FASB guidance
(also refer note 5).  

The
details of the convertible promissory notes issued are as follows:  

Interest
expense for the Nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 recognized on these convertible promissory notes amounts to $7,131
included in interest and bank charges in the statements of operations. The interest payable was also converted, together with
the principal, into shares of the Company on September 30, 2016.

5.      DERIVATIVE
                                         LIABILITIES     

Debt
or equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments, such as embedded derivative features which in certain circumstances
may be required to be bifurcated from the associated host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument liability.  

The
fair value of the Convertible Notes embedded derivatives as of September 30, 2016 are:  

A
multinomial lattice model was used to value the convertible notes and the embedded derivative liabilities as at December 31, 2015,
using the following assumptions:

from 6,000,000 shares prior to the Forward Split to 90,000,000 shares following the Forward Split. Prior year numbers have been
restated from the earliest period presented, to reflect the effect of the forward split.  

During
the Nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 633,332 shares of common stock to holders of convertible notes
on conversion of the notes and 233,333 shares to mini investors for cash consideration of $34,970.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

The
information set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations ( MD A )
contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
including, among others (i) expected changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii)
our strategy for financing our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements
of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as  believes ,  anticipates ,
 intends  or  expects . These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete
financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth of our business including entering into future agreements with companies,
and plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial
condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.   

Although
we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the
bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections,
the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us
or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.   

We
assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions
affecting forward-looking statements.   

Our
revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result
of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of
the company to insure against certain risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and
changing government regulations domestically and internationally affecting our products and businesses.   

You
should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and
the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.   

US
Dollars are denoted herein by  USD ,  $  and  dollars .   

Overview   

Intelligent
Cloud Resources Inc. ( Intelligent Cloud ) was incorporated on March 27, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada
as a development stage company. The Company aims to offer cloud enabler and cloud broker services to small and medium sized organizations
in Canada and plans to expand to such organizations in the United States in the future. The Company has a strong development team
who can build all types of applications on cloud computing and can perform cloud enabler and cloud broker services. Intelligent
Cloud Resources will help businesses to break away all of the barriers associated with installing software on to physical hardware
by making the software available from anywhere on the globe. For those enterprises that have security concerns for deploying their
applications on a public cloud, the Company can also build a private cloud accessible to only those persons who work within the
organization.  

As
of the date of this prospectus, neither our website nor any other application has been developed to the point that we can describe
specifically its nature or its scope. We have started generating minimal revenue and anticipate an increase in revenue from the
sale of our cloud services to companies. Specifically, Intelligent Cloud plans to offer the best quality cloud computing services
to the SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) sector of Canada for a monthly service charge and eventually expand such services
to this sector in the United States.  

As
of the date of this prospectus, the amounts of the prices for our range from $500 and up depending on the complexity of the software.
As our platform and services are developed, we will adjust the prices based upon our costs, the prices of competing services and
the terms of the contract with our clients.  

We
have limited operational history. We have not yet generated significant revenue and we continue to incur substantial operating
loss and an accumulated deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, our cloud services,
website and other applications, and ultimately, achieve profitable operations.  

We
are currently a development stage company and have just started generating minimal revenue. We do not currently engage in significant
business activities that provide cash flow. The contracts we have secured are expected to be an assessment of our current capabilities
and will help us determine factors such as how many hours are put in and whether or not we should adjust our prices accordingly.
These contracts are still in progress, and are proving to be beneficial and informative experiences. We may require additional
capital to implement our business and fund our operations. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis  on page

of Operations   

Intelligent
Cloud has not had significant revenues generated from its business operations since inception. Intelligent Cloud expects that
the revenues generated from its business for the next 12 months will not be enough for its required working capital. Until Intelligent
Cloud is able to generate any consistent and significant revenue it may be required to raise additional funds by way of equity
or debt financing.  

At
any phase, if Intelligent Cloud finds that it does not have adequate funds to complete a phase, it may have to suspend its operations
and attempt to raise more money so it can proceed with its business operations. If Intelligent Cloud cannot raise the capital
to proceed it may have to suspend operations until it has sufficient capital. Intelligent Cloud expects to raise the required
funds for the next 12 months with equity or debt financing.  

During
the next 12 months, management anticipates spending approximately $420,000 on the development, marketing and sales of the Technology.
Intelligent Cloud anticipates a product launch in 2017.  

The
estimated breakdown is as follows:  

Results
of Operations   Three and Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     

A
summary of our operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

A
summary of our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

Revenue   

The
Company has conducted minimal operations since inception. Minimal revenue has been generated by the Company from March 27, 2014
(Inception) to September 30, 2016. The Company's financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include
any adjustment relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Expenses   

Total operating expenses for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $2,733 and $49,974 respectively. 

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 mainly comprised, professional fees of $9,272, salaries and wages amounting
to $4,500, with a fair value adjustment on derivatives amounting to ($15,329), and interest and bank charges amounting to $4,090.  

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 mainly comprised legal fee amounting to $9,145, bookkeeping and review fee
amounting to $11,650 and other filing and edgarization fees amounting to $7,604, all included in Professional Fees above, along
with salaries and wages amounting to $13,559, with a fair value adjustment on derivatives amounting to ($2,578), and interest
and bank charges amounting to $9,900.   

Total
operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $3,392 and $16,545, respectively.  

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 mainly comprised audit and accounting fees amounting to $2,123, and other
filing and edgarization fees amounting to $1,200.  

Operating
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 mainly comprised legal fees amounting to $7,025, audit and review fee amounting
to $4,941, edgarization fees amounting to $3,228, and accounting services fee amounting to $1,130.  

Operating
expenses are higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 because of the legal expenses in relation to the initial filings,
salaries and wages which were not booked in the comparative nine months, fee for bookkeeping and derivative valuation services
which were not required in the comparative three months and fair value adjustment on derivatives.  

The
Company has a minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expenses, has experienced losses from operations,
and it does not have a significant source of revenue. Its continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute
its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing
will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.  

Net
Losses   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a net loss of $49,074 and $16,545, respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $28,091. The Company s liabilities as of September 30, 2016 were $42,644,
which comprised accrued liabilities amounting to $19,512, an amount of $22,152 due to shareholders, and an amount of $980 due
to related parties. As at September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $14,553.  

As
of September 30, 2015, the Company had cash of $74,639. The Company s liabilities as of September 30, 2015 were $177,307,
which comprised accrued liabilities amounting to $76,331, an amount of $4,849 due to shareholders, and an amount of $980 due to
related parties, convertible promissory notes amounting to $92,569 and derivative liability of $2,578. As at September 30, 2015,
the Company had a working capital deficit of $102,668.  

The
following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The
Company has incurred losses since inception and the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability
to develop profitable operations and to continue to raise adequate financing. In order for the Company to meet its liabilities
as they become due and to continue its operations, the Company is solely dependent upon its ability to generate such financing.  

Limited
Operating History   

We
have generated no independent financial history and have not previously demonstrated that we will be able to expand our business.
Our business is subject to risks inherent in growing an enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible rejection
of our business model and/or sales methods.  

Going
Concern   

Our
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As of September 30, 2016, we have not generated significant
revenues since inception.  We expect to finance our operations primarily through our existing cash, our operations and any
future financing.  However, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we will
be required to obtain additional capital in the future to continue our operations and there is no assurance that we will be able
to obtain such capital, through equity or debt financing, or any combination thereof, or on satisfactory terms or at all. Additionally,
no assurance can be given that any such financing, if obtained, will be adequate to meet our capital needs. If adequate capital
cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, our operations would be materially negatively impacted. Therefore,
our auditor has substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to complete additional offerings
is dependent on the state of the debt and/or equity markets at the time of any proposed offering, and such market s reception
of the Company and the offering terms. There is no assurance that capital in any form would be available to us, and if available,
on terms and conditions that are acceptable.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Basis
of Presentation     

Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and the SEC. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually
evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, recovery of long-lived assets, income taxes, and the valuation of
equity transactions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material
change to our reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.  

Our
financial statements do not include any comparative information as there were no significant transactions for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

For
purposes of reporting within the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all cash on hand, cash accounts not subject to
withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less
to be cash and cash equivalents.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company is in the development stage and has yet to realize revenues from operations. Once the Company has commenced operations,
it will recognize revenues when delivery of goods or completion of services has occurred provided there is persuasive evidence
of an agreement, acceptance has been approved by its customers, the fee is fixed or determinable based on the completion of stated
terms and conditions, and collection of any related receivable is probable.  

Loss
per Common Share    

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share
except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. There were no dilutive financial
instruments issued or outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Estimates    

The
financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Actual results
could differ from those estimates made by management.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Accounting
standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have
a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital
resources that are material to an investment in our securities.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   

Not
applicable because we are a smaller reporting company.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurances that information
required to be disclosed by the Company under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in its periodic reports that are filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our Principal Executive
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding financial disclosure.  

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation,
with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO )
and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of September 30, 2015 to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure for the reason described below.  

Because
of our limited operations, we have limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack a
formal audit committee with a financial expert. As we grow and expand our operations we will engage additional employees and experts
as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will expand.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. This quarterly
report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report
in this quarterly report.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

There
are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company,
any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, or security holder is a
party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. The Company s property is not the subject
of any pending legal proceedings.
