  Note 1     Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies  
  Nature of the Business 
  MasTec, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries,  MasTec  or the  Company ) is a leading infrastructure construction company operating mainly throughout North America across a range of industries.  The Company s primary activities include the engineering, building, installation, maintenance and upgrade of communications, energy and utility infrastructure, such as: wireless, wireline/fiber, satellite communications and customer fulfillment activities; petroleum and natural gas pipeline infrastructure; electrical utility transmission and distribution; power generation; and industrial infrastructure.  MasTec s customers are primarily in these industries.  MasTec reports its results under   five   reportable segments:   (1)   Communications;   (2)   Oil and Gas;   (3)   Electrical Transmission;   (4)   Power Generation and Industrial; and   (5)   Other.  
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Pursuant to these rules and regulations, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   is derived from the Company s audited financial statements as of that date.  Because certain information and footnote disclosures have been condensed or omitted, these condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015   contained in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K (the    2015   Form 10-K ).  In management s opinion, all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented have been included.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  Interim period operating results do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year.  The Company believes that the disclosures made in these condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information not misleading.  In these condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements,  $  means U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. 
  Principles of Consolidation  
  The accompanying condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements include MasTec, Inc. and its subsidiaries and include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Other parties  interests in entities that MasTec consolidates are reported as non-controlling interests within equity.  Net income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests is reported as a separate line item below net income or loss.  The Company s investments in entities for which the Company does not have a controlling interest, but for which it has the ability to exert significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  Equity method investments are recorded as other long-term assets or, for investments in a net liability position, within other long-term liabilities.  Income or loss from these investments is recorded as a separate line item in the statements of operations.  Intercompany profits or losses associated with the Company s equity method investments are eliminated until realized by the investee in transactions with third parties.  For equity investees for which the Company has an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities and profits or losses of an unincorporated entity, but the Company does not control the entity, the Company consolidates its proportional interest in the accounts of the entity.  The cost method is used for investments in entities for which the Company does not have the ability to exert significant influence.     
  Management determines whether its investment arrangements, such as equity or other interests in business entities, including contractual joint ventures, constitute a variable interest entity ( VIE ) based on the nature and characteristics of such arrangements.  If an investment arrangement is determined to be a VIE, then management determines if the Company is the VIE s primary beneficiary by evaluating several factors, including the Company s: (i) risks and responsibilities; (ii) ownership interests; (iii) decision making powers; and (iv) financial and other interests, among others.  If management determines the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, then it would be consolidated, and the other parties  interests in the VIE would be accounted for as a non-controlling interest.  The primary beneficiary consolidating the VIE must normally have both (i) the power to direct the primary activities of the VIE and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, which, in either case, could be significant to the VIE.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that certain of its investment arrangements were VIEs, but that it was not the primary beneficiary, and, accordingly, has not consolidated these VIEs.  
  Translation of Foreign Currencies    
  The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, with resulting translation gains or losses accumulated within other comprehensive income or loss.  Revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange during the applicable period.  Substantially all of the Company s foreign operations use the local currency as the functional currency.  Gains or losses resulting from transactions executed in a foreign currency are included in other income or expense, net.  
  Management Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Key estimates include: the recognition of revenue and project profit or loss (which the  
  
   7 

Company defines as project revenue, less project costs of revenue, including project-related depreciation), in particular, on construction contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method for which the recorded amounts require estimates of costs to complete projects, ultimate project profit and the amount of probable contract price adjustments as inputs; allowances for doubtful accounts; estimated fair values of goodwill and intangible assets and liabilities, acquisition-related contingent consideration and investments in equity investees; asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization; accrued self-insured claims; share-based compensation; accounting for income taxes; and the estimated impact of contingencies and ongoing litigation.  While management believes that such estimates are reasonable when considered in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
  Significant Accounting Policies    
  Revenue Recognition 
  Revenue is derived from construction projects performed under master and other service agreements as well as from contracts for specific projects or jobs requiring the construction and installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an entire infrastructure system.  The Company frequently provides maintenance under unit price or fixed price master service or other service agreements.  Revenue and related costs for master and other service agreements billed on a time and materials basis are recognized as the services are rendered.  Revenue derived from projects performed under master service and other service agreements totaled   38%   and   44%   of revenue for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and totaled   43%   and   47%   for the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The Company also performs services under master and other service agreements on a fixed fee basis, under which MasTec furnishes specified units of service for a fixed price per unit of service and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered.  Revenue from fixed price contracts provides for a fixed amount of revenue for the entire project, subject to certain additions for changed scope or specifications.  Revenue from these contracts, as well as for certain projects pursuant to master and other service agreements, is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, under which the percentage of revenue to be recognized for a given project is measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date on the contract to the total estimated costs for the contract.  Such contracts provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate the Company for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of costs incurred, units installed, hours expended or some other measure of progress.  Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontracted costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and the operational costs of capital equipment.  Much of the materials associated with the Company s work are customer-furnished and are therefore not included in contract revenue and costs. 
  The estimation process for revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion method is based on the professional knowledge and experience of the Company s project managers, engineers and financial professionals.  Management reviews estimates of contract revenue and costs on an ongoing basis.  Changes in job performance, job conditions and management s assessment of expected contract settlements are factors that influence estimates of total contract value and total costs to complete those contracts and, therefore, the Company s profit recognition.  Changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined, which could materially affect the Company s results of operations in the period in which such changes are recognized.  Excluding the effects of previously disclosed first quarter 2016 project losses of   $13.5 million   on a western Canadian oil and gas project and   $15.1 million   on an electrical transmission project, project profit was affected by less than   5%   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as a result of changes in contract estimates included in projects that were in process as of   December 31, 2015  , and, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, project profit was affected by less than   5%   as a result of changes in contract estimates included in projects that were in process as of December 31, 2014 excluding the effects of project losses of   $21.4 million   on a Canadian wind project and   $8.3 million   on a proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian joint venture.  Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  The majority of fixed price contracts are completed within   one   year. 
  The Company may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or unapproved by the customer, and/or claims related to certain contracts.  Management determines the probability that such costs will be recovered based upon engineering studies and legal opinions, past practices with the customer, specific discussions, correspondence or preliminary negotiations with the customer. The Company treats such costs as a cost of contract performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered, or defers costs and/or recognizes revenue up to the amount of the related cost if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated.    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had approximately   $29 million   and   $38 million  , respectively, of change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts that were in the process of being resolved in the normal course of business, including through negotiation, arbitration and other proceedings.  These contract price adjustments represent management s best estimate of contract revenue that has been or will be earned and that management believes is probable of collection.  As of   September 30, 2016  , these change orders were primarily related to contracts in the Oil and Gas and Power Generation and Industrial segments. The Company actively engages in substantive meetings with its customers to complete the final approval process, and generally expects these processes to be completed within   one   year.  The amounts ultimately realized upon final acceptance by its customers could be higher or lower than such estimated amounts.   
  Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are classified as current liabilities.  Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, or work in process, are classified within current assets.  Work in process on contracts is based on work performed but not yet billed to customers as per individual contract terms.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )     2016-17  , Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control   ( ASU 2016-17 ).  ASU 2016-17 changes how a reporting entity considers indirect interests held by related parties under common control when evaluating whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  ASU 2016-17 is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16  , Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ( ASU 2016-16 ), which eliminates the existing exception in U.S. GAAP prohibiting the recognition of the income tax consequences for intra-entity asset transfers. Under ASU 2016-16, entities will be required to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory when the transfer occurs.  ASU 2016-16 is effective on a modified retrospective basis for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of     Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ).  ASU 2016-15 reduces diversity in practice by providing guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows  .  ASU 2016-15 clarifies that when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated, classification will depend on the predominant source or use.    ASU 2016-15 is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.    The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ).  ASU 2016-13 changes how entities will measure and disclose credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income and replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates.  ASU 2016-13 also requires enhanced disclosures.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ).  ASU 2016-09 is intended to improve and simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions. Under ASU 2016-09, when share-based payment awards vest or are settled, excess tax benefits ( windfalls ) or tax deficiencies ( shortfalls ) are to be recognized in the income statement, rather than as additional paid-in-capital, and these tax effects will be presented within the statement of cash flows as an operating cash flow, rather than as a financing activity.  The recognition of the income tax effects of share-based payment awards in the income statement will also affect the computation of dilutive common stock equivalents as calculated under the treasury stock method, as windfalls will no longer be included in assumed proceeds from outstanding awards.  ASU 2016-09 increases the amount an employer can withhold to cover statutory employee tax withholdings, and requires that payments to taxing authorities for such employee withholdings be presented as a financing activity.  ASU 2016-09 also provides for an accounting policy election for forfeitures, whereby forfeitures can either be estimated or accounted for as incurred.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted if all provisions of the standard are early adopted.  The Company is currently evaluating the expected adoption method and potential effect of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 ), in April 2016 issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 ), and in May 2016, issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting   ( ASU 2016-11 )  .    ASU 2016-08 clarifies principal versus agent considerations relating to when another party, along with the entity, is involved in providing a good or service to a customer.  ASU 2016-08 requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise is to provide a good or service to a customer, or to arrange for the good or service to be provided to the customer by the other party.  This determination is based upon whether the entity controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer.  When the entity that satisfies a performance obligation is the principal, the entity recognizes the gross amount of consideration as revenue.  When the entity that satisfies the performance obligation is the agent, it recognizes the amount of any fee or commission as revenue.  ASU 2016-10 clarifies the guidance in Topic 606 for identifying performance obligations in a contract as well as the implementation guidance pertaining to revenue recognition related to licensing arrangements.  ASU 2016-11 rescinds several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in Topic 605, including, among other items, guidance relating to accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer, as well as accounting for shipping and handling fees and freight services.  In May 2016, the FASB also issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ), which provides clarification on certain topics within ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ), including assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, the measurement date for non-cash consideration and completed contracts at transition, as well as providing a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition.  The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09, which is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the expected adoption method and potential effect of these ASUs on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   ( ASU 2016-07 ).  ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement that an investor retrospectively apply the equity method of  
  
   9 

accounting when an investment becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence.  ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting.  ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not expect that this ASU will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)   ( ASU 2016-06 ) and ASU 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)   ( ASU 2016-05 ).  ASU 2016-06 clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call or put options that can accelerate repayment are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract.  When a call or put option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise the option is related to interest rates or credit risk.  An entity is only required to assess the embedded call or put option in accordance with the four-step decision sequence under current GAAP.  ASU 2016-06 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, on a modified retrospective basis.  Early adoption is permitted.  ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument is not, in and of itself, considered to be a termination of the original derivative instrument, which would discontinue the application of hedge accounting, provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  ASU 2016-05 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  ASU 2016-05 is effective either prospectively or on a modified retrospective basis.  The Company does not expect these ASUs to have an effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Subtopic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ).  ASU 2016-02 provides revised guidance for lease accounting and related disclosure requirements, including a requirement for lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for operating leases with a duration of greater than one year.  Under the previous guidance, lessees were not required to recognize assets and liabilities for operating leases on the balance sheet.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  Modified retrospective application is required for all relevant prior periods.  The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  Upon adoption, the Company expects to recognize lease assets and liabilities for certain of its operating leases. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted as of January 1, 2016 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03   ),   which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the reclassification of   $12.9 million   of deferred financing costs associated with the Company s credit facility and senior notes from other current and other long-term assets to current and long-term debt as of December 31, 2015, which amount was composed of approximately   $5.5 million  ,   $1.0 million   and   $6.4 million   related to the Company s credit facility, term loan and   4.875%   senior notes, respectively.  See   Note 7   - Debt. 
   
  Note 2     Earnings Per Share  
  Basic earnings or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss attributable to MasTec by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, which excludes non-participating unvested restricted share awards.  Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income or loss attributable to MasTec by the weighted average number of fully diluted shares, as calculated under the treasury stock method, which includes the potential effect of dilutive common stock equivalents, such as outstanding but unexcercised stock options and/or issued but unvested restricted shares.  If the Company reports a loss, rather than income, the computation of diluted loss per share excludes dilutive common stock equivalents, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, the Company reported a net loss, which resulted in the exclusion of 648,379 weighted average dilutive common stock equivalents from the calculation of diluted loss per share.        
  The following table provides details underlying the Company s earnings per share calculations for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

(a) 
    Calculated as total net income (loss) less amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. 
              (b) 
    Excludes non-participating unvested restricted share awards and treasury stock.

     Note 4     Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, cash collateral deposited with insurance carriers, life insurance assets, cost and equity investees, deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities, accounts payable and other current liabilities, acquisition-related contingent consideration, certain intangible assets and liabilities, including off-market contracts, and debt obligations. 
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The fair value guidance establishes a valuation hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value.  The three levels of inputs that may be used are: (i) Level 1 - quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; (ii) Level 2 - observable market-based inputs or other observable inputs; and (iii) Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data, which are generally determined using valuation models incorporating management estimates of market participant assumptions.  In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Management s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. 
  Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using public market prices, quotes from financial institutions and other available information.  Due to their short-term maturity, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their fair values.  Management believes the carrying values of notes and other receivables, cash collateral deposited with insurance carriers, deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities and outstanding balances on its credit facilities approximate their fair values.  
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , financial instruments required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted primarily of acquisition-related contingent consideration, which represents the estimated fair value of future earn-outs payable for acquisitions of businesses ( ASC 805 contingent consideration ), and is   based on management estimates and entity-specific assumptions, which are Level 3 inputs, and is evaluated on an ongoing basis.    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the Company s ASC 805 contingent consideration totaled   $41.0 million   and   $58.4 million  , respectively. 
  
   11 

There were   no   additions to ASC 805 contingent consideration from new business combinations in either of the three or   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015.  Payments in connection with ASC 805 contingent consideration for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $5.3 million   and   $15.8 million  , respectively, and totaled   $5.5 million   and   $37.7 million   for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company recognized a net reduction in ASC 805 contingent consideration of   $2.3 million   related to a decrease in the expected earn-out obligations for certain of the Company s western Canadian oil and gas businesses due to finalization of completed earn-out arrangements and adjustments to expected future period earn-out obligations.  For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized net reductions of   $4.4 million   and   $8.0 million  , respectively, of ASC 805 contingent consideration, which related primarily to finalization of earn-out arrangements in the Oil and Gas, Electrical Transmission and Communications segments.  These adjustments were recorded within other income.  Foreign currency translation activity associated with ASC 805 contingent consideration, which is included within other comprehensive income or loss, as appropriate, was de minimis for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  . Foreign currency translation losses for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $0.5 million  .  Foreign currency translation gains associated with ASC 805 contingent consideration totaled   $2.8 million   and   $6.4 million   for the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

One   of these entities was liquidated in 2016, and the second, which is in the final stages of liquidation, is being managed by a receiver to assist with the orderly wind-down of its operations.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded   $3.6 million   of earnings related to increases in expected recoveries from these investments.      The aggregate net carrying value of these investments, including project and financing receivables, totaled   $32.2 million   and   $28.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which amounts were substantially all recorded within other current assets.

  Note 10     Other Retirement Plans 
  Multiemployer Plans.    Certain of MasTec s subsidiaries, including certain subsidiaries in Canada, contribute amounts to multiemployer pension and other multiemployer benefit plans and trusts, which are recorded as a component of employee wages and salaries within costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization.  Contributions are generally based on fixed amounts per hour per employee for employees covered under these plans.  Multiemployer plan contribution rates are determined annually and assessed on a  pay-as-you-go  basis based on union employee payrolls.  Union payrolls cannot be determined for future periods because the number of union employees employed at any given time, and the plans in which they may participate, vary depending upon the location and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects.        Total contributions to multiemployer plans, and the related number of employees covered by these plans, including with respect to the Company s Canadian operations, for the periods indicated were as follows: 

The average number of employees covered under multiemployer plans increased for the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the same periods in 2015 primarily due to an increase in the Company s union resource-based projects for its oil and gas operations in the U.S., which resulted in higher levels of multiemployer plan contributions for the respective periods. 
   
  Note 11     Equity 
  Share Activity 
  On February 25, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a   $100 million   share repurchase program (the  2016 Share Repurchase Program ).  Under the 2016 Share Repurchase Program, which does not have an expiration date, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions or in privately-negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws.  The timing and the amount of any repurchases will be determined based on market conditions, legal requirements, cash flow and liquidity needs and other factors.  The share repurchase program may be modified or suspended at any time, at the Company s discretion.  Share repurchases, which are recorded at cost and are held in the Company s treasury, will be funded with available cash or with availability under the Credit Facility.  For the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016  ,   no   shares were repurchased under the 2016 Share Repurchase Program.  For the nine month period ended September 30, 2015,   5.2 million   shares of the Company s stock were repurchased under a separate and completed share repurchase program, established in 2014, for an aggregate purchase price of   $100 million  . 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss comprises foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses from certain investment activities.  Foreign currency translation gains and losses relate primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of the Company s foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, and foreign currency activity for the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   related primarily to the Company s Canadian operations.  Investment activity for the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   related to interest rate swaps associated with our equity investments in the Waha JVs.

Note 12   - Income Taxes  
  In determining the quarterly provision for income taxes, management uses an estimated annual effective tax rate based on forecasted annual pre-tax income, permanent tax differences, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  The effect of significant discrete items is separately recognized in the quarter(s) in which they occur.    For the nine month period ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred   $2.6 million   of income tax expense in connection with the non-recurring cumulative revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities pursuant to an Alberta provincial tax law that was enacted in June 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $5.9 million   of current deferred tax assets, net, and   $167.2 million   of long-term deferred tax liabilities, net.  As of   December 31, 2015  , current deferred tax assets, net, totaled   $19.2 million   and long-term deferred tax liabilities, net, totaled   $188.8 million  .  
   
  Note 13   - Segments and Related Information     
  Segment Discussion 
  MasTec manages its operations under five operating segments, which represent MasTec s five reportable segments: (1) Communications; (2) Oil and Gas; (3) Electrical Transmission; (4) Power Generation and Industrial and (5) Other.  This structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for MasTec s labor-based construction services.      All five reportable segments derive their revenue from the engineering, installation and maintenance of infrastructure, primarily in North America. 
  The Communications segment performs engineering, construction, maintenance and customer fulfillment activities related to communications infrastructure primarily for wireless and wireline/fiber communications and install-to-the-home customers, and, to a lesser extent, distribution infrastructure for electrical utilities, among others.      MasTec performs engineering, construction and maintenance services on oil and natural gas pipelines and processing facilities for the energy and utilities industries through its Oil and Gas segment.      The Electrical Transmission segment primarily serves the energy and utility industries through the engineering, construction and maintenance of electrical transmission lines and substations.      The Power Generation and Industrial segment primarily serves energy, utility and other end-markets through the installation and construction of conventional and renewable power facilities, related electrical transmission infrastructure, ethanol/biofuel facilities and various types of industrial infrastructure.      The Other segment includes equity investees and other small business units that perform construction and other services for a variety of international end-markets.     
  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) is the measure of profitability used by management to manage its segments and, accordingly, in its segment reporting.  As appropriate, the Company supplements the reporting of consolidated financial information determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP with certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA.  The Company believes these non-U.S. GAAP measures provide meaningful information and help investors understand the Company s financial results and assess its prospects for future performance.  The Company uses EBITDA to evaluate its performance, both internally and versus that of its peers, because it excludes certain items that may not be indicative of the Company s reportable segment results, as well as items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry.  Segment EBITDA is calculated in a manner consistent with consolidated EBITDA.  
  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , Oil and Gas segment EBITDA included a previously disclosed first quarter project loss of   $13.5 million   on a western Canadian oil and gas project and restructuring charges of   $6.5 million   to streamline certain western Canadian oil and gas operations.  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , Electrical Transmission EBITDA included a previously disclosed first quarter project loss of    $15.1 million  , and for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , Electrical Transmission segment EBITDA included restructuring charges of   $4.5 million   and   $7.3 million  , respectively, to streamline business operations.  For both the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , Other segment EBITDA included   $5.1 million   of project losses on a proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian joint venture, for which we have minimal direct construction involvement.   
  For the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  : (i) Communications segment EBITDA included   $1.2 million   and   $17.8 million  , respectively, of WesTower Communications Inc. ( WesTower ) acquisition integration costs; (ii) Electrical Transmission segment EBITDA included a   $12.2 million   charge relating to a court mandated mediation settlement; (iii) Other segment EBITDA included   $2.8 million   and   $8.3 million  , respectively, of project losses on a proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian joint venture; (iv) Corporate segment EBITDA included   $4.1 million   and   $14.6 million  , respectively, of Audit Committee independent investigation costs related to the independent investigation that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015; and (v) Power Generation and Industrial segment EBITDA included   $3.8 million   and   $21.4 million  , respectively, of losses on a Canadian wind project. 
  Restructuring costs for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of (i)   $4.7 million   and   $10.9 million  , respectively, of employee separation costs and other restructuring-type costs, including lease termination expenses, which are included within general and administrative expenses; and (ii)   $2.9 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , of estimated losses on the planned disposal of excess fixed assets that are held-for-sale, which are included within other expense.  When the Company identifies assets as held-for-sale, they are valued based on their estimated fair value less costs to sell, classified within other current assets, and depreciation is no longer recorded.  As of   September 30, 2016  , assets classified as held-for-sale totaled   $2.4 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , a restructuring cost liability of   $6.4 million   was included within various current liability accounts.

   18 

and revenue of   $222.8 million   and   $451.2 million  , respectively, was derived from operations in Canada and Mexico.  The majority of the Company s foreign operations during the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were in the Company s Oil and Gas segment.  Long-lived assets held in the U.S. included property and equipment, net, of   $476.2 million   and   $464.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Long-lived assets held in foreign countries, primarily in Canada, included property and equipment, net, of   $78.3 million   and   $94.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   intangible assets and goodwill, net, related to the Company s U.S. operations totaled approximately   $1.1 billion  .  Intangible assets and goodwill, net, related to businesses in foreign countries, primarily in Canada, totaled approximately   $111.1 million   and   $107.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , amounts due from customers from which foreign revenue was derived accounted for approximately   9%   and   17%  , respectively, of the Company s consolidated net accounts receivable position, which represents accounts receivable, net, less billings in excess of costs and earnings.

  Note 14   - Commitments and Contingencies 
  In addition to the matters discussed below, MasTec is subject to a variety of legal cases, claims and other disputes that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business.  MasTec cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in recovering all or any of the potential damages it has claimed or in defending claims against the Company.  The outcome of such cases, claims and disputes, including those set forth below, cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Wrigley v. MasTec, Inc.    In May 2015, a putative class action lawsuit (the  Lawsuit ), Wrigley v. MasTec, Inc., et. al. (Case No. 1:15-cv-21740) was filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, naming the Company, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Jos  R. Mas, and the Company s Chief Financial Officer, George L. Pita, as defendants.  In August 2015, co-lead plaintiffs were appointed, and an amended complaint was filed in October 2015.  The Lawsuit has been purportedly brought by a shareholder, both individually and on behalf of a putative class of shareholders, alleging violations of the federal securities laws arising from alleged false or misleading statements contained in, or alleged material omissions from, certain of the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and other statements, in each case with respect to accounting matters that are the subject of the Audit Committee s independent internal investigation.  The amended complaint seeks damages stemming from losses Plaintiffs claim to have suffered as a result of purchasing Company securities at an allegedly inflated market price.  The Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.  In September 2016, the Company s motion to dismiss was granted without prejudice, which gives the Plaintiffs the opportunity to file a second amended complaint.  The Company believes that the Lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its defense. 
  Other Commitments and Contingencies  
  Regulatory Matters.    As previously disclosed, the Company self-reported to the staff of the SEC (the  Staff ) regarding the previously disclosed Audit Committee s independent investigation.  On December 2, 2015, the Company was notified by the Staff that it had commenced a formal civil investigation relating to the previously disclosed adjustments to the 2014 quarterly condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements and Audit Committee independent investigation.  The Company intends to continue full cooperation with the SEC. 
  Leases.    In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into non-cancelable operating leases for certain of its facility, vehicle and equipment needs, including related party leases.  See   Note 8   - Lease Obligations and   Note 15   - Related Party Transactions. 
  Letters of Credit.    In the ordinary course of business, the Company is required to post letters of credit for its insurance carriers, surety bond providers and in support of performance under certain contracts as well as certain obligations associated with the Company s cost and equity investees, including its variable interest entities.  Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution.  The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit under certain conditions.  If this were to occur, the Company would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit, which, depending upon the circumstances, could result in a charge to earnings.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   $280.6 million   and   $292.8 million  , respectively, of letters of credit issued under the Company s Credit Facility.  The Company is not aware of material claims relating to its outstanding letters of credit.  
  
   19 

Performance and Payment Bonds.    In the ordinary course of business, MasTec is required by certain customers to provide performance and payment bonds for some of the Company s contractual commitments related to projects in process.  These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that the Company will perform under the terms of a contract and that the Company will pay subcontractors and vendors.  If the Company fails to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond.  The Company must reimburse the surety for expenses or outlays it incurs.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated cost to complete projects secured by the Company s   $122.4 million   in performance and payment bonds was   $11.4 million  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , the estimated cost to complete projects secured by the Company s   $539.3 million   in performance and payment bonds was   $36.0 million  .  These amounts do not include performance and payment bonds associated with the Company s equity investees. 
    
  Cost and Equity Investees and Other Entities.    The Company holds a   35%   undivided interest in a proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian contractual joint venture that provides civil construction infrastructure services, which is managed by a third party, automatically terminates upon completion of the project, and for which we have minimal direct construction involvement.  The Company also holds   90%   and   85%   undivided interests, respectively, in   two   proportionately consolidated non-controlled contractual joint ventures that provide infrastructure construction services for electrical transmission projects.  Income and/or losses incurred by these joint ventures are generally shared proportionally by the joint venture members, with members of the joint venture jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture.  The joint venture agreements provide that each joint venture partner indemnify the other party for any liabilities incurred by such joint venture in excess of its ratable portion of such liabilities.  Thus, it is possible that the Company could be required to pay or perform obligations in excess of its share if the other joint venture partner fails or refuses to pay or perform its share of the obligations.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was not aware of circumstances that would reasonably lead to future claims against it for material amounts. 
  The Company has other investment arrangements, as discussed in   Note 4   - Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  From time to time, the Company may provide financing, performance, financial and/or other guarantees to or on behalf of its investees. 
  Self-Insurance.    MasTec maintains insurance policies for workers  compensation, general liability and automobile liability, which are subject to per claim deductibles.  The Company also maintains excess umbrella coverage.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , MasTec s liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses related to these policies, totaled   $80.1 million   and   $76.1 million  , respectively, of which   $51.4 million   and   $47.5 million   was reflected within other long-term liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  MasTec also maintains an insurance policy with respect to employee group medical claims, which is subject to annual per employee maximum losses.  MasTec s liability for employee group medical claims as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled   $2.7 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively. 
  The Company is required to post letters of credit and provide cash collateral to certain of its insurance carriers and to provide surety bonds in certain states.  Insurance-related letters of credit for the Company s workers  compensation, general liability and automobile liability policies amounted to   $80.4 million   and   $83.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  In addition, cash collateral deposited with insurance carriers, which is included within other long-term assets, amounted to   $1.5 million   and   $1.3 million   for these policies as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Outstanding surety bonds related to workers  compensation self-insurance programs amounted to   $13.5 million   and   $13.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Employment Agreements.    The Company has employment agreements with certain executives and other employees, which provide for compensation and certain other benefits and for severance payments under certain circumstances.  Certain employment agreements also contain clauses that become effective upon a change in control of the Company.  Upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in the various employment agreements, the Company would be obligated to pay certain amounts to the relevant employees, which vary with the level of the employees  respective responsibility.  
  Collective Bargaining Agreements and Multiemployer Plans.    As discussed in   Note 10   - Other Retirement Plans, certain of MasTec s subsidiaries are party to various collective bargaining agreements with unions representing certain of their employees.  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (collectively,  ERISA ), which governs U.S.-registered multiemployer pension plans, subjects employers to substantial liabilities in the event of the employer s complete or partial withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plans.  Under current law pertaining to employers that are contributors to U.S.-registered multiemployer defined benefit plans, a plan s termination, an employer s voluntary withdrawal from, or the mass withdrawal of contributing employers from, an underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan requires participating employers to make payments to the plan for their proportionate share of the multiemployer plan s unfunded vested liabilities.  These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits of the plan for all plan participants, not only for benefits payable to participants of the contributing employer.  As a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for unfunded vested benefits if the other participating employers cease to contribute to, or withdraw from, the plan.  The allocable portion of liability to participating employers could be more disproportionate if employers that have withdrawn from the plan are insolvent, or if they otherwise fail to pay their proportionate share of the withdrawal liability.  The Company currently contributes, and in the past has contributed to, plans that are underfunded, and, therefore, could have potential liability associated with a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal from, or termination of, these plans.  Other than the Company s 2011 withdrawal from Central States Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund ( Central States ), as discussed below, and certain other underfunded plans, also discussed below, the Company does not have plans to withdraw from, and, other than Central States, is not aware of related liabilities associated with these plans.  However, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be assessed liabilities in the future.  The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that underfunded pension plans improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on their level of underfunding, under which benefit reductions may apply and/or participating employers could be required to make additional contributions.  In addition, if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service (the  IRS ) may impose on the employers contributing to such plan a non-deductible excise tax of 5% of the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency.   
  Based upon the information available to the Company from plan administrators as of   September 30, 2016  , several of the multiemployer pension plans in which it participates are underfunded and, as a result, the Company could be required to increase its contributions, including in the form of a  
  
   20 

surcharge on future benefit contributions.  The amount of additional funds the Company may be obligated to contribute in the future cannot be estimated, as these amounts are based on future levels of work of the union employees covered by these plans, investment returns and the level of underfunding of such plans.  In November 2014, the Company, along with other members of the Pipe Line Contractors Association (the  PLCA ), voluntarily terminated its participation in several defined benefit multiemployer pension plans.  Additionally, in November 2011, the Company, along with other members of the PLCA, voluntarily withdrew from Central States, for which a   $6.4 million   withdrawal liability was established as of the date of withdrawal.  In the first quarter of 2016, the Company paid   $3.0 million  , which represented the balance of the recorded withdrawal liability as of December 31, 2015.  The Company is in arbitration to determine if there is any remaining liability owed on this withdrawal liability, or whether the amount can be further reduced based on arguments available to the Company.  Although the Company does not expect this amount, whether an increase or a decrease, if any, to be material, there can be no assurance as to the final determination. 
  Indemnities.    The Company generally indemnifies its customers for the services it provides under its contracts, as well as other specified liabilities, which may subject the Company to indemnity claims, liabilities and related litigation.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company was not aware of material asserted or unasserted claims in connection with these indemnity obligations. 
  Other Guarantees.      In the ordinary course of its business, from time to time, MasTec guarantees the obligations of its subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors  licenses.    MasTec has also issued performance and other guarantees in connection with certain of its equity investees.    MasTec also generally warrants the work it performs for a one to two year period following substantial completion of a project.    Much of the work performed by the Company is evaluated for defects shortly after the work is completed.  MasTec has not historically accrued reserves for potential warranty claims as they have not been material.  However, if warranty claims occur, the Company could be required to repair or replace warrantied items, or, if customers elect to repair or replace the warrantied item using the services of another provider, the Company could be required to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement.   
  Concentrations of Risk.    The Company had approximately   415   customers for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015,   one   customer accounted for approximately   30%   and   12%  , respectively, of the Company s consolidated net accounts receivable position, which represents accounts receivable, net, less billings in excess of costs and earnings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , a separate customer accounted for approximately   17%   of the Company s consolidated net accounts receivable position.  In addition, the Company derived   80%   and   64%  , respectively, of its revenue from its top   ten   customers for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and derived   76%   and   60%   of its revenue, respectively, from its top   ten   customers for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

In addition, for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company provided   $0.8 million   and   $5.6 million  , respectively, of project-related financing in connection with this contractual joint venture.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   additional amounts committed. 
  The Company has   90%   and   85%   undivided interests, respectively, in   two   proportionately consolidated non-controlled contractual joint ventures that provide electrical transmission infrastructure services, for which the Company and its joint venture partner equally share voting and decision-making control.  As of   September 30, 2016  , current assets and current liabilities relating to these contractual joint ventures, which totaled   $9.2 million   and   $7.1 million  , respectively, were included in the Company s consolidated balance sheet.

  MasTec entered into a subcontracting arrangement in the first quarter of 2016 for the performance of construction services with an entity, the minority owners of which include an entity controlled by Jorge Mas and Jos  R. Mas, along with   two   members of the management of a subsidiary of the Company.  MasTec incurred   $5.6 million   and   $8.8 million   of expenses under this subcontracting arrangement for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and, during the third quarter of 2016, sold equipment totaling   $0.3 million   to this entity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , related amounts payable totaled   $3.2 million  . 
  MasTec leases employees to a customer in which Jorge Mas and Jos  R. Mas own a majority interest.  For both three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , MasTec charged approximately   $0.2 million   to this customer, and for both the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   charged approximately   $0.6 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , outstanding receivables from employee leasing arrangements with this customer totaled   $0.2 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively.

The Company entered into a leasing arrangement in 2015 with a third party that leases an aircraft from a Company owned by Jorge Mas.  The Company paid   $0.7 million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, under this leasing arrangement for the   three   and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  The Company has   no   related payables as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  For the   three   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , related party lease payments for operational facilities and equipment, typically associated with members of subsidiary management, totaled approximately   $12.5 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , related party lease payments totaled approximately   $31.6 million   and   $14.5 million  , respectively.  Payables associated with related party leases totaled approximately   $0.1 million   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Prepaid amounts associated with related party leases totaled   $0.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  In addition, related party payments for various types of supplies and services, including ancillary construction services, project-related site restoration and marketing and business development activities involving members of subsidiary management, totaled approximately   $7.4 million   and   $14.2 million   for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $3.1 million   and   $4.5 million   for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , related payables totaled approximately   $6.0 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively. 
  Non-controlling interests in entities consolidated by the Company represent ownership interests held by certain members of management of several of the Company s subsidiaries, primarily in our Oil and Gas segment, and the Company has a subcontracting arrangement with   one   of these entities for the performance of ancillary oil and gas construction services.  Expense related to this subcontracting arrangement is eliminated in consolidation.  
  Split Dollar Agreements 
  MasTec has split dollar insurance agreements with each of Jos  R. Mas and Jorge Mas.  In connection with the split dollar agreement for Jorge Mas, the Company paid   $0.6 million   for both the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, and paid   $1.1 million   for both the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  In connection with the split dollar agreement for Jos  R. Mas, the Company made   no   payments in either of the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015, and paid   $0.7 million   for both the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , life insurance assets associated with these agreements totaled   $14.8 million   and   $13.0 million  , respectively, which were included within other long-term assets.

           ITEM  2.  
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
     The following is a discussion of our business, financial position and results of operations as of and for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) contained in our 2015 Form 10-K.  In this MD A,  $  means U.S. dollars unless specified otherwise. 
   
  Business Overview  
  We are a leading infrastructure construction company operating mainly throughout North America across a range of industries.  Our primary activities include the engineering, building, installation, maintenance and upgrade of communications, energy and utility infrastructure, such as: wireless, wireline/fiber, satellite communications and customer fulfillment activities; petroleum and natural gas pipeline infrastructure; electrical utility transmission and distribution; conventional and renewable power generation; and industrial infrastructure.  Our customers are primarily in these industries.  Including our predecessor companies, we have been in business for more than   85   years.  We offer our services primarily under the MasTec service mark and, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   21,400   employees and   500   locations.  We have been consistently ranked among the top specialty contractors by Engineering News-Record for the past several years. 
  We provide our services to a diversified base of customers.  We often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements.  The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system.  Revenue from non-recurring, project specific work may experience greater variability than master service agreement work due to the need to replace the revenue as projects are completed.  If we are not able to replace work from completed projects with new project work, we may not be able to maintain our current revenue levels or our current level of capacity and resource utilization.  We actively review our backlog of project work and take appropriate action to minimize such exposure.  
  We manage our operations under five operating segments, which represent our five reportable segments: (1) Communications; (2) Oil and Gas; (3) Electrical Transmission; (4) Power Generation and Industrial and (5) Other.  This structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our labor-based construction services.  See   Note 13   - Segments and Related Information and   Note 14   - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference, for segment related information as well as operating results by segment and significant customer concentrations.  
   
  Backlog  
  Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options.  Our estimated backlog also includes amounts under master service and other service agreements and includes our proportionate share of estimated revenue from proportionately consolidated non-controlled joint ventures.  Estimated backlog for work under master service and other service agreements is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers.  We expect to realize approximately   30%   of our   September 30, 2016   estimated backlog in 2016.  The following table presents 18-month backlog by reportable segment as of the dates indicated: 
  
   27 

Approximately   65%   of backlog as of   September 30, 2016   is attributable to amounts under master service or other service agreements, pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services.  Most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice.  Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer delays, regulatory factors and/or other project-related factors.  These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all.  In the past, we have occasionally experienced postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work from master service agreements due to changes in our customers  spending plans, as well as on construction projects, due to market volatility and regulatory factors.  There can be no assurance as to our customers  requirements or the accuracy of our estimates.  As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings.  
  Backlog is not a term recognized under U.S. GAAP; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry.  Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others.     
  Economic, Industry and Market Factors 
  We closely monitor the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers.  General economic and market conditions can negatively affect demand for our customers  products and services, which can lead to rationalization of our customers  capital and maintenance budgets in certain end-markets.  Fluctuations in market prices for oil, gas and other fuel sources can affect demand for our services, in particular, on pipeline and power generation construction services.  These fluctuations, as well as the highly competitive nature of our industry, can result, and in recent years, has resulted, in lower bids and lower profit on the services we provide.  In the face of increased pricing pressure, we strive to maintain our profit margins through productivity improvements and cost reduction programs.  Other market, regulatory and industry factors, such as (i) changes to our customers  capital spending plans; (ii) mergers and acquisitions among the customers we serve; (iii) access to capital for customers in the industries we serve; (iv) new or changing regulatory requirements or other governmental policy uncertainty; (v) economic, market or political developments; and (vi) changes in technology, tax and other incentives could also affect demand for our services.  While we actively monitor economic, industry and market factors that could affect our business, we cannot predict the effect that changes in such factors may have on our future results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, and we may be unable to fully mitigate, or benefit from, such changes. 
  Impact of Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business  
  Our revenue and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations.  These variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project schedules and timing, in particular, for large non-recurring projects and holidays.  Typically, our revenue is lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions cause project delays.  Revenue in the second quarter is typically higher than in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity.  The third and fourth quarters are typically the most productive quarters of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway and weather is normally more accommodating to construction projects.  In the fourth quarter, many projects tend to be completed by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets before the end of the year, which generally has a positive impact on our revenue.  However, the holiday season and inclement weather can cause delays, which can reduce revenue and increase costs on affected projects.  Any quarter may be positively or negatively affected by adverse or unusual weather patterns, including from excessive rainfall, warm winter weather or natural catastrophes such as hurricanes or other severe weather, making it difficult to predict quarterly revenue and margin variations. 
       Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical.  Fluctuations in end-user demand within the industries we serve, or in the supply of services within those industries, can impact demand for our services.  As a result, our business may be adversely affected by industry declines or by delays in new projects.  Variations in project schedules or unanticipated changes in project schedules, in particular, in connection with large construction and installation projects, can create fluctuations in revenue, which may adversely affect us in a given period, even if not in total.  In addition, revenue from master service agreements, while generally predictable, can be subject to volatility.  The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital; variations in project margins; regional, national and global economic, political and market conditions; regulatory or environmental influences; and acquisitions, dispositions or strategic investments can also materially affect quarterly results.  Accordingly, our operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period. 
   
  Critical Accounting Estimates 
  This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Given that management estimates,  
  
   28 

by their nature, involve judgments regarding future uncertainties, actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions change or if certain key assumptions used in making these estimates ultimately prove to be inaccurate.  Our accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  Refer to   Note 1   - Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference, and to our 2015 Form 10-K for discussion of our significant accounting policies.  During the third quarter of 2016, in conjunction with the quarterly review of reporting units for indicators of impairment, management performed a quantitative assessment of the goodwill associated with its Electrical Transmission operating segment, and the estimated fair value of this operating segment exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%.  Significant changes in assumptions or estimates, such as a reduction in profitability and/or cash flows, could result in a non-cash impairment charge of this operating segment in the future. 
  We believe that our accounting estimates pertaining to revenue and cost recognition for percentage-of-completion projects, including project profit or loss, which we define as project revenue less project costs of revenue, including project-related depreciation; allowances for doubtful accounts; fair value estimates, including those related to estimated liabilities for future earn-out obligations, valuations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and estimated recoveries under receivership arrangements; income taxes; self-insurance liabilities; and litigation and other contingencies are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and require significant or complex judgment and estimates on the part of management. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Comparison of Quarterly Results  
  The following table, which may contain slight summation differences due to rounding, reflects our consolidated results of operations in dollar and percentage of revenue terms for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in millions).  Our consolidated results of operations are not necessarily comparable from period to period due to the impact of certain items, which are described in the comparison of results section below.  

We review our operating results by reportable segment.  See   Note 13   - Segments and Related Information in the notes to the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference.  Our reportable segments are:   (1)   Communications;   (2)   Oil and Gas;   (3)   Electrical Transmission;   (4)   Power Generation and Industrial and   (5)   Other.  Management s review of reportable segment results includes analyses of trends in revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin.  We calculate EBITDA for segment reporting purposes consistently with our consolidated EBITDA calculation.  See the discussion of our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including certain adjusted non-U.S. GAAP measures, as described following the comparison of results discussion below.  The following table presents revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin by reportable segment for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in millions): 
  
   29 

The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
  Revenue  .    For the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , consolidated revenue   increased   to   $1,586 million   from   $1,111 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $475 million  , or   43%  , as compared with the same period in   2015  .  Oil and Gas revenue   increased   by   $329 million  , or   81%  , Communications revenue   increased   by   $111 million  , or   22%  , Electrical Transmission revenue   increased   by   $26 million  , or   34%  , Power Generation and Industrial revenue   increased   by   $9 million  , or   7%  , and Other segment revenue   increased   by   $4 million  , or   100%  .  
  Communications Segment  .    Communications revenue was   $624 million   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $513 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $111 million  , or   22%  .  Revenue increased as a result of higher levels of wireless, install-to-the-home and wireline/fiber installation services from increased customer demand. 
  Oil and Gas Segment  .    Oil and Gas revenue was   $736 million   for three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $407 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $329 million  , or   81%  .  The increase in Oil and Gas revenue was driven primarily by an increase in several large long-haul pipeline infrastructure construction projects, partially offset by a decrease in gathering pipeline and related facilities project activities, largely in our Canadian operations. 
  Electrical Transmission Segment  .    Electrical Transmission revenue was   $102 million   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $76 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $26 million  , or   34%  .  The increase in Electrical Transmission revenue as compared with the same period in the prior year was driven primarily by project timing. 
  Power Generation and Industrial Segment  .    Power Generation and Industrial revenue was   $124 million   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $115 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $9 million  , or   7%  .  The growth was driven by higher levels of renewable power project activity as compared with the same period in the prior year. 
  Other Segment  .    Other segment revenue totaled approximately   $8 million   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $4 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $4 million  , or   100%  .  The   increase   was driven primarily by an increase in oil and gas operations in Mexico as compared with the same period in the prior year. 
  Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization.    Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization,   increased   by   $396 million  , or   41%  , to   $1,369 million   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $973 million   for the same period in   2015  .    Higher   revenue contributed   $416 million   of an   increase   in costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, whereas   improved   productivity resulted in a   decrease   of approximately   $20 million  .  Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue   decrease  d by approximately   120   basis points, from   87.6%   of revenue for the three month period ended   September 30, 2015   to   86.3%   of revenue for the same period in   2016  .  This   decrease   was driven primarily by improvements in our Oil and Gas segment from a combination of project efficiencies and mix, as well as improved cost and overhead utilization due to higher levels of revenue, and in our Electrical Transmission segment due to project timing and improved levels of project efficiencies as compared with the same period in the prior year, partially offset by growth-related production inefficiencies in our Communications segment and timing of project-related losses and settlements in other segment results. 
  Depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation and amortization was   $43 million  , or   2.7%   of revenue, for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $42 million  , or   3.8%   of revenue, in   2015  .  As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization decreased by approximately   110   basis points from improved levels of equipment utilization due to higher levels of revenue.  
  General and administrative expenses  .    General and administrative expenses were   $67 million  , or   4.2%   of revenue, for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $64 million  , or   5.7%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $3 million  , or   5%  .  General and administrative expenses for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   included restructuring charges of approximately   $5 million   related primarily to our efforts to streamline our electrical transmission operations.  General and administrative expenses in the prior year period included Audit  
  
   30 

Committee independent investigation expenses of   $4 million   and acquisition integration costs from our WesTower acquisition of approximately   $1 million  , both of which were completed in 2015.  In addition to the above mentioned changes, various administrative expenses  increased by approximately   $4 million  , net, for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the prior year period, including costs to support growth initiatives, incentive compensation expense and professional fees, offset by timing of legal and other settlements. 
  Interest expense, net.    Interest expense, net of interest income, was   $13 million  , or   0.8%   of revenue, for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $12 million  , or   1.1%   of revenue, in 2015.  The   increase   was due primarily to interest expense on our Credit Facility, which increased due to higher average interest rates and higher average outstanding letters of credit in the third quarter of   2016   as compared with 2015.  The increase in outstanding letters of credit was due to higher levels of project activity in 2016 as well an increase in our collateral requirements associated with our investments in the Waha JVs.  
  Equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated affiliates.    Equity in losses (earnings) of unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of income or losses from equity investees.  For the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , equity in losses from unconsolidated affiliates were de minimis. 
  Other (income) expense, net.    For the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , other   income  , net, was   $1 million  , as compared with other expense, net, of   $6 million   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  Other (income) expense, net, consists primarily of gains or losses from sales of assets and investments, estimated restructuring losses on the planned disposal of fixed assets held-for-sale, certain legal/other settlements, gains or losses from changes to estimated earn-out accruals and certain purchase accounting adjustments.   For the three month period ended   September 30, 2015  , other expense included a $12 million charge related to a court mandated mediation settlement, which was offset, in part, by income of approximately $4 million from changes to estimated earn-out accruals.  For both the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , gains on sales of equipment totaled approximately   $1 million  . 
  Provision for income taxes.      Income tax expense   was   $39 million   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $6 million   for the same period in the prior year.  In the third quarter of   2016  , we had pre-tax   income   of   $95 million   as compared with   $14 million   for the same period in the prior year.  Our effective tax rate for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   versus the same period in   2015   due to the effect of permanent differences in relation to pre-tax income and a decrease in the overall state tax rate as compared with the three month period ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Analysis of EBITDA by Segment 
  Communications Segment.    EBITDA for our Communications segment was   $63 million  , or   10.1%   of revenue, for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $50 million  , or   9.7%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  , a   $13 million  , or   27%     increase  , primarily due to higher levels of revenue.  As a percentage of revenue, EBITDA   increased   by approximately   40   basis points, or   $2 million  , driven by improved levels of cost and overhead utilization from higher levels of revenue, partially offset by growth-related production inefficiencies.  For the three month period ended   September 30, 2015  , Communications segment EBITDA included approximately   $1 million   of acquisition integration costs.  
  Oil and Gas Segment.    EBITDA for our Oil and Gas segment was   $118 million  , or   16.0%   of revenue, for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $51 million  , or   12.5%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $67 million  , or   131%  .  Higher revenue contributed   $41 million   of an increase in EBITDA.  As a percentage of revenue, Oil and Gas segment EBITDA   increased   by approximately   350   basis points, or   $25 million  , primarily from a combination of project efficiencies and mix, as well as improved cost and overhead utilization due to higher levels of revenue.     
  Electrical Transmission Segment.    EBITDA for our Electrical Transmission segment was negative   $8 million  , or negative   8.1%   of revenue, for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with negative EBITDA of approximately   $24 million  , or negative   31.2%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   in EBITDA of   $15 million  .  Electrical Transmission results in the third quarter of   2016   included restructuring charges of approximately   $4 million   related to efforts to streamline our operations, which we anticipate will be completed in 2016.  In the third quarter of 2015, our Electrical Transmission segment recorded a   $12 million   charge related to a settlement reached during a court mandated mediation.  The remaining improvement in Electrical Transmission EBITDA was due to higher levels of revenue and improved levels of project efficiencies as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
  Power Generation and Industrial Segment.    EBITDA for our Power Generation and Industrial segment was   $6 million   or   4.9%   of revenue, for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with EBITDA of   $5 million  , or   4.2%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   in EBITDA of   $1 million  , or   27%  .  As a percentage of revenue, Power Generation and Industrial segment EBITDA   increased   by approximately   80   basis points, or approximately   $1 million  , primarily due to the non-recurrence of approximately   $4 million   of losses on a troubled wind project in Canada that was completed in the third quarter of 2015, offset by changes in project timing and mix, as well as increased cost investments in business development initiatives. 
  Other Segment.    EBITDA from Other businesses was negative   $3 million   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with negative EBITDA of   $2 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   a decrease   in EBITDA of   $1 million  , or   57%  .  For the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , Other segment EBITDA included losses of   $5 million   and $3 million, respectively, on a proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian joint venture.  This project, for which we have minimal direct construction involvement, has experienced delays due to issues with receipt of a key material, which has extended the project timeline and resulted in project losses.  The material was received in the second half of 2016, and this project is now expected to be substantially completed in first half of 2017.  The effect on Other segment EBITDA from these project losses was partially offset by an increase in EBITDA from our oil and gas operations in Mexico.

Corporate.    Corporate EBITDA was negative   $24 million   for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with negative EBITDA of   $12 million   for the same period in   2015  , for   a decrease   in EBITDA of   $12 million  .  Corporate EBITDA for the three month period ended   September 30, 2015   included $4 million of costs related to the Audit Committee independent investigation, which was completed in 2015, offset by a $4 million net reduction for the 2015 period in the estimated earn-out liability for acquired businesses.  For the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , various other corporate expenses increased by approximately   $12 million   as compared with the prior year period, including costs to support planned growth initiatives, timing of legal and other settlements, professional fees and incentive compensation expense. 
  Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
  Revenue  .    For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , consolidated revenue   increased   to   $3,793 million   from   $3,181 million  ,   an increase   of approximately   $612 million  , or   19.2%  , as compared with the same period in   2015  .  Oil and Gas revenue   increased   by   $310 million  , or   27%  , Communications revenue   increased   by   $276 million  , or   19%  , Power Generation and Industrial revenue   increased   by   $22 million  , or   7%  , and Electrical Transmission revenue   increased   by   $13 million  , or   5%  .  Other segment revenue   decreased   by approximately   $2 million  , or   14%  . 
  Communications Segment  .    Communications revenue was   $1,728 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $1,452 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $276 million  , or   19%  .  Revenue increased as a result of higher levels of install-to-the-home, wireless and wireline/fiber installation services from increased customer demand. 
  Oil and Gas Segment  .    Oil and Gas revenue was   $1,454 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $1,144 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $310 million  , or   27%  .  The increase in Oil and Gas revenue was driven primarily by an increase in several large long-haul pipeline infrastructure construction projects, partially offset by a decrease in gathering pipeline and related facilities project activities, largely in our Canadian operations. 
  Electrical Transmission Segment  .    Electrical Transmission revenue was   $284 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $270 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $13 million  , or   5%  .  The   increase   in Electrical Transmission revenue as compared with the same period in the prior year was driven primarily by project timing and improved levels of efficiencies. 
  Power Generation and Industrial Segment  .    Power Generation and Industrial revenue was   $325 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $302 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $22 million  , or   7%  .   The growth was driven by higher levels of renewable power project activity as compared with the same period in the prior year.  
  Other Segment  .    Other segment revenue totaled approximately   $15 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $17 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   a decrease   of approximately   $2 million  , or   14%  .  The   decrease   was driven primarily by lower revenue from our proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian joint venture. 
  Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization.    Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization,   increased   by approximately   $516 million   to   $3,322 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $2,805 million   for the same period in   2015  .    Higher   revenue contributed an   increase   of   $540 million  , whereas increased productivity resulted in a   decrease   of   $23 million  .  Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue   decreased   by approximately   60   basis points, from   88.2%   of revenue for the nine month period ended   September 30, 2015  , to   87.6%   for the same period in the current year.  This decrease resulted from improvements in our Oil and Gas and Power Generation and Industrial segments, offset by reduced productivity in our Electrical Transmission and Communications segments and timing of project-related losses and settlements in other segment results.  The improvements in Oil and Gas and Power Generation and Industrial were due to the benefit of higher levels of revenue, as well as project efficiencies and mix.  The reductions in Electrical Transmission and Communications were due to project and growth-related inefficiencies, respectively. 
  Depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation and amortization was   $122 million  , or   3.2%   of revenue, for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $128 million  , or   4.0%   of revenue, in   2015  ,   a decrease   of   $6 million  , or   5%  .  As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization decreased by approximately   80   basis points from improved levels of equipment utilization due to higher levels of revenue.  
  General and administrative expenses  .    General and administrative expenses were   $195 million  , or   5.1%   of revenue, for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $207 million  , or   6.5%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  ,   a decrease   of   $12 million  , or   6%  .  General and administrative expenses for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   included restructuring charges of approximately   $11 million   related to our efforts to streamline our western Canadian oil and gas and our electrical transmission operations.  General and administrative expenses in the prior year period included acquisition integration costs from our WesTower acquisition of approximately   $18 million   and Audit Committee independent investigation expenses of   $14 million  , both of which were completed in 2015.  Excluding the above mentioned items, various administrative expenses increased by approximately   $9 million  , net, for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the prior year period, including costs to support growth initiatives, incentive compensation expense and professional fees, offset by timing of legal and other settlements. 
  Interest expense, net.    Interest expense, net of interest income, was   $38 million  , or   1.0%   of revenue, for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $36 million  , or   1.1%   of revenue, in 2015.  The   increase   in interest expense in 2016 was due to higher average interest rates and higher average outstanding letters of credit on our Credit Facility for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the same period in the prior year, offset, in part, by a decrease in financing costs.  The increase in outstanding letters of credit was due to higher levels of project activity in 2016 as well as an increase in our collateral requirements associated with our investments in the Waha JVs.  For the nine month period ended   September 30, 2015  , we incurred approximately   $1 million   of consent solicitation fees related to the delay in filing of our 2014 Form 10-K and first quarter 2015 Form 10-Q.  
  
   32 

Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates.    Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of income or losses from equity investees.  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately   $4 million   was primarily attributable to income from expected recoveries from certain equity investees in our Oil and Gas segment, of which the remaining investment as of   September 30, 2016   is in the final stage of liquidation.  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  , equity in losses related to these entities totaled approximately   $4 million  . 
  Other (income) expense, net.    For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , other   income  , net, was   $13 million  , as compared with other expense of   $1 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  Other (income) expense, net, consists primarily of gains or losses from sales of assets and investments, estimated restructuring losses on the planned disposal of fixed assets held-for-sale, certain legal/other settlements, gains or losses from changes to estimated earn-out accruals and certain purchase accounting adjustments.  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , other   income  , net, included approximately $10 million of income related to a settlement in connection with a previously acquired business and   $3 million   of restructuring charges related to estimated losses on the planned disposal of fixed assets held-for-sale, whereas for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  , other expense, net, included a $12 million charge related to a court mandated mediation settlement, offset, in part, by $8 million of income from changes to estimated earn-out accruals.  Gains on sales of equipment totaled approximately   $3 million   for both the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
  Provision for income taxes.      Income tax expense   was   $54 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   Income tax expense   of   $3 million   for the same period in the prior year.  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we had pre-tax   income   of   $132 million   as compared with pre-tax   income   of   $1 million   for the same period in the prior year.    Income tax expense   for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 included approximately   $3 million   of expense resulting from the cumulative revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities pursuant to an Alberta provincial tax law that was enacted in June 2015.  Excluding the effect of the Alberta income tax expense in 2015, our effective tax rate for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   decreased versus the same period in   2015   due to the effect of permanent differences in relation to pre-tax income and a decrease in the overall state tax rate as compared with the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Analysis of EBITDA by Segment 
  Communications Segment.    EBITDA for our Communications segment was   $191 million  , or   11.0%   of revenue, for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $142 million  , or   9.8%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  , a   $49 million  , or   35%     increase  .    Higher   revenue contributed   an increase   of   $27 million   in EBITDA.  As a percentage of revenue, EBITDA   increased   by approximately   130   basis points, or approximately   $22 million  .  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  , Communications segment EBITDA included approximately   $18 million   of acquisition integration costs, whereas Communications segment EBITDA for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   included a gain of approximately   $10 million   from a settlement in connection with a previously acquired business.  
  Oil and Gas Segment.    EBITDA for our Oil and Gas segment was   $188 million  , or   12.9%   of revenue, for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $114 million  , or   10.0%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   of   $74 million  , or   65%  .    Higher   revenue contributed   an increase   of   $31 million   in EBITDA.  As a percentage of revenue, Oil and Gas segment EBITDA   increased   by approximately   290   basis points, or approximately   $43 million  , from a combination of project efficiencies and mix, as well as improved cost and overhead utilization due to higher levels of revenue, partially offset by a previously disclosed first quarter project loss of   $13.5 million   on a western Canadian oil and gas project and restructuring charges of approximately   $7 million   related to efforts to streamline our western Canadian oil and gas operations, which we anticipate will be completed in 2016.  
  Electrical Transmission Segment.    EBITDA for our Electrical Transmission segment was negative   $42 million  , or negative   14.8%   of revenue, for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with negative EBITDA of approximately   $48 million  , or negative   17.6%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   in EBITDA of   $6 million  , or   12%  .  Electrical Transmission results for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   included restructuring charges of approximately   $7 million   related to efforts to streamline operations, which we anticipate will be completed in 2016, and a previously disclosed first quarter project loss of approximately   $15 million   on a large transmission project.  In the third quarter of 2015, our Electrical Transmission segment recorded a $12 million charge related to a settlement reached during a court mandated mediation.  The remaining improvement in Electrical Transmission EBITDA was due to higher levels of revenue and improved levels of project efficiencies as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
  Power Generation and Industrial Segment.    EBITDA for our Power Generation and Industrial segment was   $14 million  , or   4.3%   of revenue,  for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with EBITDA of   $4 million  , or   1.3%   of revenue, for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   in EBITDA of   $10 million  , primarily due to the non-recurrence of   $21 million   of losses on a troubled wind project in Canada that was completed in the third quarter of 2015 offset by changes in project timing and mix, as well as increased cost investments in business development initiatives. 
  Other Segment.    EBITDA from Other businesses was negative   $3 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with negative EBITDA of   $7 million   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase   in EBITDA of   $5 million  , or   64%  .  Other segment EBITDA for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   included   $5 million   and   $8 million  , respectively, of losses on a proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian joint venture that experienced project delays. This project, for which we have minimal direct construction involvement, has experienced delays due to issues with receipt of a key material, which has extended the project timeline and resulted in project losses.  The material was received in the second half of 2016, and this project is now expected to be substantially completed in first half of 2017.  Other segment EBITDA for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   also included an increase in EBITDA from our oil and gas operations in Mexico as compared with the same period in the prior year. 
  Corporate.    Corporate EBITDA was negative   $55 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with negative EBITDA of   $41 million   for the same period in   2015  , representing   a decrease   in EBITDA of approximately   $15 million  .  Corporate EBITDA for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015   included   $14 million   of costs related to the Audit Committee independent investigation, which was  
  
   33 

completed in 2015, offset, in part, by a net reduction of   $8 million   in the estimated earn-out liability for acquired businesses.  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , excluding the above mentioned items, various other corporate expenses increased by approximately   $20 million   as compared with the prior year period, including costs to support planned growth initiatives, timing of legal and other settlements, professional fees and incentive compensation expense. 
  Foreign Operations    
  Our foreign operations are primarily in Canada and Mexico.  See   Note 13   - Segments and Related Information in the notes to the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference.   
   
  Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
  As appropriate, we supplement our reported U.S. GAAP financial information with certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ).  In addition, we have presented  Adjusted EBITDA,  as well as adjusted net income ( Adjusted Net Income ) and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share ).  All of these  adjusted  non-U.S. GAAP measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition integration costs resulting from the WesTower acquisition, Audit Committee independent investigation related costs, project losses on a proportionately consolidated non-controlled Canadian joint venture, charges from a settlement reached during a court mandated mediation and, for Adjusted Net Income, the effect of an Alberta provincial income tax rate increase.  The definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA above are not the same as in our Credit Facility or in the indenture governing our notes; therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this discussion should not be used for purposes of determining our compliance with the covenants contained in our debt instruments. 
  We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to evaluate our performance, both internally and as compared with our peers, because these measures exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results, as well as items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry, and for non-cash stock-based compensation expense, can also be subject to market volatility.  Additionally, these measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business.  Management also considers EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as indicators of our ability to generate cash to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business, but management does not consider the presented non-U.S. GAAP financial measures as measures of our liquidity.  While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures of our ability to generate cash, these measures exclude the cash impact of changes in our assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes.  Net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows accounts for these changes in our assets and liabilities. 
  We believe these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information and help investors understand our financial results and assess our prospects for future performance.  Because non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies  non-U.S. GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.  These financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or alternative measures of, reported net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share and net cash provided by operating activities, and should be viewed in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and the provided reconciliations thereto.  We believe these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, when viewed together with our U.S. GAAP results and related reconciliations, provide a more complete understanding of our business.  We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure. 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), in dollar and percentage of revenue terms, for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in millions).  The tables below may contain slight summation differences due to rounding.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin by reportable segment, and a related reconciliation to EBITDA, for the periods indicated is as follows:  

The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities for total MasTec (in millions):  

(a) 
    Non-cash EBITDA adjustments include depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. 
     Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 
  The table below reconciles Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share with reported net income (loss) and reported diluted earnings (loss) per share, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.  Adjustments have been tax-effected using the effective tax rate for the respective periods, excluding certain discrete items.  
  
   35 

(a) 
    Represents the provision for income taxes, before and after adjustment for the tax effects of the adjusted items in the table above.  The tax effects of the adjusted items were determined based on the tax treatment of the related items and after taking into consideration their effect on pre-tax income.  For both the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated effective tax rates as reported were   41%  , and as adjusted, were   39%   and   40%  , respectively.  For the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , our consolidated effective tax rates as reported were   45%   and   630%  , respectively, and, as adjusted, were each   45%  . 
              (b) 
    Adjusted diluted earnings per share includes a per share tax effect of   $0.05   and   $0.13   for the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and a per share tax effect of   $0.13   and   $0.31   for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, related to the adjustments presented above. 
              (c) 
    For nine month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , because the reported loss from continuing operations, on an adjusted basis is income from continuing operations, we included an additional   0.6 million   weighted average common stock equivalents in our diluted share count to calculate adjusted diluted earnings per share for the respective periods. 
              (d) 
    Audit Committee investigation related costs for the nine month period ended   September 30, 2015   includes $0.9 million, pre-tax, and $0.5 million, after tax, of consent solicitation agent fees recorded within interest expense, net, related to the delay in filing of our 2014 Form 10-K and our first quarter 2015 Form 10-Q. 
      
  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, availability under our Credit Facility and our cash balances.  Our primary liquidity needs are for working capital, income taxes, capital expenditures, insurance collateral in the form of cash and letters of credit, earn-out obligations, cost and equity investee funding requirements, debt service and share repurchase programs.  We also evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions  
  
   36 

and investments from time to time, and we may consider opportunities to repurchase, refinance or retire outstanding debt, any of which may require our use of cash.  
  Capital Expenditures  .    For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we spent   $89 million   on capital expenditures, or   $82 million  , net of asset disposals.  For the year ending   December 31, 2016  , we estimate that we will spend approximately   $110 million   on capital expenditures, or approximately   $100 million  , net of asset disposals, and expect to incur approximately   $30 million   to   $40 million   of equipment purchases under capital lease or other financing arrangements.  Actual capital expenditures may increase or decrease in the future depending upon business activity levels, as well as ongoing assessments of equipment lease versus buy decisions based on short and long-term equipment requirements.  
  Acquisition-Related Contingent Consideration  .    In most of our acquisitions, we have agreed to make future earn-out payments to the sellers, which are contingent upon the future earnings performance of the acquired businesses.  Certain earn-out payments may be paid in either cash or, under specific circumstances, MasTec common stock, or a combination thereof, at our option.  The estimated total value of earn-out obligations recorded as liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $42 million  .  Of this amount,   $10 million   represents the liability for earn-out obligations that have been earned.  The remainder,   $32 million  , is management s estimate of potential earn-out obligations that are contingent upon future performance.  Potential future earn-out obligations for acquisitions after January 1, 2009 are measured at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a component of other income or expense, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Earn-outs for acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2009 are recorded as additional goodwill as earned.  During the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   we made cash payments of   $5 million   and   $6 million  , respectively, related to earn-out obligations. During the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   we made cash payments of   $20 million   and   $45 million  , respectively, related to earn-out obligations. 
  Income Taxes.    Cash tax payments, net of tax refunds, were   $15 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with   $6 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  Quarterly tax payments, which vary with changes in taxable income and earnings, are based on estimates of full year taxable income activity and estimated tax rates.  Our cash tax payments, have   increased   in the   2016   period as compared with the   2015   period due to higher levels of pre-tax income.  
  Working Capital.    We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, primarily due to the effect of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work and the spending patterns of our customers, both of which influence the timing of associated spending to support related customer demand.  Our business is typically slower in the first quarter of each calendar year.  Working capital needs are generally higher during the summer or fall months due to increased demand for our services when favorable weather conditions exist in many of the regions in which we operate.  Conversely, working capital needs are typically converted to cash during the winter months.  These seasonal trends, however, can be offset by changes in the timing of projects, which can be affected by project delays or accelerations and/or other factors that may affect customer spending. 
  Working capital requirements also tend to increase when we commence multiple projects or particularly large projects because labor, including subcontractor costs, and certain other costs, including inventory, become payable before the receivables resulting from work performed are billed and collected.  Timing of billing milestones and project close-outs can contribute to changes in unbilled revenue.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we expect that substantially all of our costs in excess of billings and earnings will be billed to customers in the normal course of business within the next twelve months.  Accounts receivable balances, which consist of contract billings as well as costs and earnings in excess of billings and retainage,   increase  d to   $1.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $0.9 billion   as of   December 31, 2015   due to higher levels of quarterly revenue and changes in project timing and mix. 
  Our billing terms are generally net 30 days, and some of our contracts allow our customers to retain a portion of the contract amount (generally, from   5%   to   10%  ) until the job is completed.  For certain customers, we maintain inventory to meet the materials requirements of the contracts.  Occasionally, certain of our customers pay us in advance for a portion of the materials we purchase for their projects, or allow us to pre-bill them for materials purchases up to specified amounts.  Vendor terms are generally 30 days.  Our agreements with subcontractors often contain a  pay-if-paid  provision, whereby our payments to subcontractors are made only after we are paid by our customers. 
  Summary of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We anticipate that funds generated from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility and our cash balances will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, required income tax payments, debt service obligations, anticipated capital expenditures, cost and equity investee funding requirements, insurance collateral requirements, earn-out obligations, letter of credit and share repurchase needs for at least the next twelve months. 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $480 million   in working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, as compared with   $377 million   as of   December 31, 2015  ,   an increase   of   $103 million  , due primarily to increased investment in working capital from higher levels of revenue and project activity.  Total cash and cash equivalents of   $9 million   as of   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $4 million   from total cash and cash equivalents of   $5 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .   
  Sources and uses of cash are summarized below (in millions): 
  
   37 

Operating Activities.    Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by changes in the timing of demand for our services and operating margins, but can also be affected by working capital needs associated with the various types of services we provide.  Working capital is affected by changes in accounts receivable, costs and earnings in excess of billings, accounts payable and accrued expenses and billings in excess of costs and earnings, all of which tend to be related.  These working capital items are affected by changes in revenue resulting from both the timing and the volume of work performed, by variability in the timing of customer billings and collections of receivables, as well as settlement of payables and other obligations.  Net cash   provided by   operating activities for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   was   $127 million  , as compared with   $261 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The   decrease   in cash flow from operations was due primarily to increased investment in working capital from higher levels of revenue and project activity.  Net changes in assets and liabilities had a   negative   effect on cash provided by operating activities of   $221 million  , related largely to net changes in the above described working capital items.  The   negative   effect of net changes in assets and liabilities was offset, in part, by an   increase   in net income of   $81 million  .  
  Our days sales outstanding ( DSO ), net of billings in excess of costs and earnings, was   61   as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   68   as of   December 31, 2015   and   75   as of   September 30, 2015  .  DSO, net of billings in excess of costs and earnings, is calculated as accounts receivable, net, less billings in excess of costs and earnings, divided by average daily revenue for the most recently completed quarter as of the balance sheet date.  The decrease in DSO is attributable to improved timing of collections and settlements, changes in project and customer mix and working capital initiatives.  Other than matters subject to litigation, we do not anticipate material collection issues related to our outstanding accounts receivable balances, nor do we have material amounts due from customers experiencing financial difficulties.  We expect to collect substantially all of our outstanding accounts receivable, net, within the next twelve months. 
  Investing Activities.    Net cash   used in   investing activities   decrease  d by   $76 million   to   $94 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   from   $170 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  .  Payments for other investments, which relates primarily to activity associated with cost and equity investees as well as payments for executive life insurance policies, was   $8 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   $109 million   for the same period in   2015  , representing a   decrease   in cash used in investing activities of   $102 million  .  For the nine month period ended   September 30, 2015  , payments for other investments included amounts paid in connection with certain equity investee receivership arrangements as well as our investment in the Waha JV s.  In connection with the expected completion and in service status of the Waha JV projects in 2017, we expect that the majority of the   $109 million   letters of credit we have issued as collateral as of   September 30, 2016   will be replaced with cash contributions by the end of 2017.  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we spent   $89 million   on capital expenditures, or   $82 million  , net of asset disposals, as compared with capital expenditures, net of asset disposals, of   $61 million   for the same period in the prior year, for   an increase   in cash used in investing activities of approximately   $21 million  . 
  Financing Activities.    Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   was   $28 million  , as compared with   $107 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  , for   a decrease   in cash used in financing activities of approximately   $80 million  .  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not make any payments for repurchases of shares of our common stock under our 2016 share repurchase program, whereas for the same period in 2015, we paid   $100 million   to repurchase shares of our common stock under our 2014 share repurchase program.  Payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016   decreased   by   $25 million   as compared with the same period in the prior year, representing   a decrease   in cash used in financing activities.  Credit facility related activity, net, for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , totaled   $37 million   of borrowings, net of repayments, compared to   $89 million   for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2015  ,   a decrease   in cash provided by credit facility-related activities, net, of   $53 million  . 
   
  Senior Secured Credit Facility 
  We have a senior secured credit facility, which, as amended to date, we refer to as our Credit Facility.  The Credit Facility has aggregate borrowing commitments of approximately   $1.2 billion  , composed of   $1.0 billion   of revolving commitments and a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of   $241 million   (the  Term Loan ).  The Credit Facility provides the ability to borrow in either Mexican pesos or Canadian dollars, up to an aggregate equivalent amount of $200 million.  Revolving commitments under the Credit Facility mature on   October 29, 2018  , and the Term Loan matures on   November 21, 2019  .  The Term Loan is subject to amortization in quarterly principal installments of   $3.1 million  , subject to reduction as a result of the application of certain prepayments in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility, which commenced as of the quarter ending   March 31, 2016  .  In May 2016, the Credit Facility was amended to increase the maximum amount available for letters of credit from   $450 million   to   $650 million  , of which up to   $100 million   can be denominated in either Mexican pesos or Canadian dollars.  The Credit Facility also provides for swing line loans of up to   $75 million  .  Under the Credit Facility, we have the option to increase revolving commitments and/or establish additional term loan tranches in an aggregate amount of   $250 million  , subject to certain conditions.  Borrowings under the Credit Facility are used for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including our equity investees, the repurchase or prepayment of indebtedness and share repurchases.  
  Interest on outstanding revolving loans and the Term Loan under the Credit Facility accrues at variable rates based, at our option, on a Eurocurrency rate, as defined in the Credit Facility, plus a margin, or a base rate, as defined in the Credit Facility, plus a margin.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $261 million   of outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Facility, of which approximately   $114 million   was denominated in foreign currencies.  Outstanding revolving loans accrued interest at a weighted average interest rate of   3.41%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  We had   $281 million    
  
   38 

of issued letters of credit as of   September 30, 2016   that mature at various dates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , letter of credit fees accrued at   1%   per annum for performance standby letters of credit and   2%   per annum for financial standby letters of credit.  The Term Loan accrued interest at a rate of   2.52%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Borrowing capacity of   $459 million   as of   September 30, 2016   was available for revolving loans or up to   $369 million   for new letters of credit.  The unused facility fee was   0.40%   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries (the  Guarantor Subsidiaries ) and the obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our and the Guarantor Subsidiaries  respective assets, subject to certain exceptions. 
  We are dependent upon borrowings and letters of credit under the Credit Facility to fund our operations.  Should we be unable to comply with the terms and conditions of the Credit Facility, we would be required to obtain modifications to the Credit Facility or obtain an alternative source of financing to continue to operate, neither of which may be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  The Credit Facility is subject to certain provisions and covenants, as more fully described in Note 8 - Debt in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
  Other Credit Facilities  .  We have other credit facilities that support the working capital requirements of our foreign operations, which have varying dates of maturity and are generally renewed on an annual basis.  Borrowings under these credit facilities are primarily denominated in Canadian dollars and maximum borrowing capacity totaled approximately   $31 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Outstanding borrowings, which accrued interest at a weighted average rate of   3.6%  , totaled approximately   $15 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  4.875% Senior Notes 
  We have   $400 million   outstanding principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes, which are subject to certain provisions and covenants, as more fully described in Note 8 - Debt in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Form 10-K.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with these provisions and covenants.  
  Debt Guarantees and Covenants 
  The 4.875% Senior Notes are senior unsecured unsubordinated obligations and rank equal in right of payment with existing and future unsubordinated debt, and rank senior in right of payment to existing and future subordinated debt and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated, joint and several basis by certain of our existing and future 100%-owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are each guarantors of the Credit Facility or other outstanding indebtedness.  See   Note 16   - Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Unaudited Consolidating Financial Information in the notes to the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference.  We were in compliance with the provisions and covenants contained in our outstanding debt instruments as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Additional Information  
  For detailed discussion and additional information pertaining to our debt instruments, see Note 8 - Debt in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Form 10-K.  Also see   Note 7   - Debt in the notes to the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for current period balances and discussion, which is incorporated by reference.  
   
  Off-balance sheet arrangements 
  As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business.  Our significant off-balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating leases, letter of credit obligations, surety and performance and payment bonds entered into in the normal course of business, self-insurance liabilities, liabilities associated with multiemployer pension plans, liabilities associated with certain indemnification and guarantee arrangements and obligations relating to our cost and equity investees, including our variable interest entities.  Refer to   Note 14   - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference, for current period details pertaining to our off-balance sheet arrangements.  See   Note 4   - Fair Value of Financial Instruments and   Note 15   - Related Party Transactions for discussion pertaining to certain of our investment arrangements, which notes are incorporated by reference. 
  Impact of Inflation  
  The primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are labor and fuel costs, and to a lesser extent, material costs.  The prices of oil and gas are subject to unexpected fluctuations due to events outside of our control, including geopolitical events and fluctuations in global supply and demand.  An example is the recent volatility experienced by the oil markets due to declining oil prices beginning in 2014.  We closely monitor inflationary factors and any impact they may have on our operating results or financial condition. 
   
  ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Interest Rate Risk  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our variable interest rate debt was primarily related to our Credit Facility.  Interest on outstanding revolving loans and our Term Loan under our Credit Facility accrues at variable rates based, at our option, on a Eurocurrency rate, as defined in the Credit Facility, plus a margin, or a base rate, as defined in the Credit Facility, plus a margin.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $261 million   aggregate principal amount of outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Facility with a weighted average interest rate of   3.41%   and a Term Loan with a balance of   $241 million   with an interest rate of   2.52%  .  Interest on letters of credit issued under our Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016   accrued at   1%   per annum for performance standby letters of credit and at   2%   per annum for financial standby letters of credit.  A 100 basis point increase in the applicable interest  
  
   39 

rates under our credit facilities would have increased our interest expense by approximately $4 million for the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our fixed interest rate debt primarily included   $400 million   aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes and an aggregate   $111 million   of notes payable and capital lease obligations, which accrued interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 2.8% as of   September 30, 2016  .  None of this debt subjects us to interest rate risk, but we may be subject to changes in interest rates if and when we refinance this debt at maturity or otherwise.  
  Foreign Currency Risk  
  Our foreign operations are primarily in Canada and Mexico.  Revenue generated from foreign operations represented   6%   of our total revenue for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  .  Revenue and expense related to our foreign operations are, for the most part, denominated in the functional currency of the foreign operation, which minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates would have on net income or loss.  We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies.  Such transactions were not material to our operations for the three or   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  .  Translation gains or losses, which are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss, result from translation of the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars.  For the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , foreign currency translation losses totaled approximately   $1.5 million  . For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , foreign currency translation gains totaled approximately   $4.4 million  . Translation gains or losses are related primarily to our Canadian operations. 
  Our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could increase in the future if we continue to expand our operations outside of the United States.  We seek to manage foreign currency exposure by minimizing our consolidated net asset and liability positions in currencies other than the functional currency, neither of which were material as of   September 30, 2016  .  We may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts in the future to manage such exposures. 
   
           Item 4.  
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )).  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II.     OTHER INFORMATION 
   
           ITEM  1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
     Legacy Litigation  
  Refer to   Note 14     Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference in this Item 1, for a discussion of any recent material developments related to our legal proceedings since the filing of our 2015 Form 10-K.  
   
  ITEM  1A.    RISK FACTORS 
  Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to either the cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements or to any of the risk factors disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K, as updated by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
  Risks Related to Our Business  
  We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers, or a reduction in their demand for our services, could impair our financial performance. 
  For the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , we derived approximately   30%   and   34%   of our revenue from AT T, respectively, and   35%   and   26%   of our revenue from Energy Transfer affiliates, respectively.  For both the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , we derived approximately   31%   of our revenue from AT T.  Our revenue could significantly decline if we were to lose one or more of our significant  
  
   40 

customers, or if one or more of our customers elected to perform the work that we provide with in-house service teams.  Our top ten customers accounted for   80%   and   64%   of our revenue for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and accounted for   76%   and   60%   of our revenue for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Because our business is concentrated among relatively few major customers, and certain of our services are provided on a non-recurring, project by project basis, our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be negatively affected if these customers reduce the amount of business they provide to us, or if we complete the required work on our projects for these customers and cannot replace them with similar projects.  Approximately   35%   of our revenue was derived from non-recurring project specific work for the three and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  .  Many of the contracts with our largest customers may be canceled on short or no advance notice.  Any of these factors could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  
   
  ITEM 2.     UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  The following table provides information about repurchases of our common stock during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  :  

(a) 
    Reflects share repurchases associated with certain employee elections under compensation and benefit programs.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 4.1 

FIFTEENTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this    Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture   ), dated as of September 1, 2016, among MP DRILLING HOLDINGS, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (the    New Guarantor   ), MASTEC, INC., a Florida corporation (the    Company   ), and U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as trustee under the Indenture referred to below (the    Trustee   ).
