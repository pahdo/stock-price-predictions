AFC Building Technologies Inc.  Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements  March 31, 2015 and 2014   

1.  
     
       Nature of Operations   

AFC Building Technologies Inc. (the  Company ) was
      incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 10, 2011.
      Effective January 10, 2014, the Company changed its name from Auto Tool
      Technologies Inc. to AFC Building Technologies Inc. The Company is engaged
      in the sales and distribution of hand tools in Canada.   

The accompanying interim consolidated financial
      statements of the Company should be read in conjunction with the
      consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes filed with the
      U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Company s Annual Report on
      Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. In the opinion of
      management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all
      adjustments of a recurring nature considered necessary to present fairly
      the Company s financial position and the results of its operations and its
      cash flows for the periods shown.   

These consolidated financial statements have been
      prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue
      to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course
      of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is
      dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders and
      note holders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity
      financing to continue operations, and ultimately the attainment of
      profitable operations. As at March 31, 2015, the Company has not generated
      any revenues, has a working capital deficit of $321,099, and has an
      accumulated deficit of $295,398 since inception. These factors raise
      substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going
      concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
      any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
      amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
      the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.   

On June 30, 2015, the Company decided that continuing the
      operations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited ( DSL )
      would no longer be economically feasible due to the factors described in
      Note 1. All of the shares of DSL held by the Company were returned to DSL
      for cancellation and as of June 30, 2015 the Company no longer held any
      interest in DSL.   

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
      have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
      accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with
      the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) instructions for companies
      filing Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim
      consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as
      the annual consolidated financial statements and reflect all adjustments,
      which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present
      fairly the financial position as of March 31, 2015, and the results of
      operations and cash flows for the period then ended. The financial data
      and other information disclosed in the notes to the interim consolidated
      financial statements related to this period are unaudited. The results for
      the three-month period ended March 31, 2015 are not necessarily indicative
      of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or the entire
      year ending December 31, 2015. The unaudited interim consolidated
      financial statements have been condensed pursuant to the Securities and
      Exchange Commission's rules and regulations and do not include all of the
      information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
      principles for complete financial statements. Therefore, these unaudited
      interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
      with the Company s annual audited consolidated financial statements and
      notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2014, included in the
      Company s Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2015 with the SEC.   

These financial statements and related notes are
      expressed in US dollars. The consolidated financial statements include the
      accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products
      Limited. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
      The Company s fiscal year-end is December 31.

and our wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited, a company incorporated

  General Overview   
 We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on
May 10, 2011 and are engaged in the distribution of hand tools throughout
Canada. Our fiscal year end is December 31. We have one subsidiary, DSL Products
Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario,
Canada, which we acquired via a share exchange on December 30, 2011 in exchange
for 30,000,000 pre-split shares of our common stock, and which operates our hand
tool distribution business. Our business offices are currently located at 101
Mary Street West, Whitby, Ontario, Canada, L1N 2R4. The address of agent for
service in Nevada and registered corporate office is c/o National Registered
Agents, Inc. of Nevada, 100 East William Street, Suite 204, Carson City, NV,
89701. Our telephone number is (905) 430-6433.  
  Our Current Business   
 We import and market hand tools, automotive accessories, lawn
and garden products, home products, accessories and attachments for power tools,
plumbing products, consumer mechanics tools, cargo control systems and
accessories and fasteners. These products are sold to professional end users,
distributors, and consumers, and are primarily distributed through retailers
(including auto parts stores, home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and
retail lumber yards).  
 10 

Hand tools include measuring and leveling tools, hex key sets,
hammers, demolition tools, knives and blades, screwdrivers, saws, chisels,
clamps and clamping systems and consumer tackers. Automotive accessories include
fuses and fuse sets, o-rings sets, specialty tools, tune-up kits, tire repair
kits, electrical test kits, jumper cable sets, and mechanic gloves. Electric
power tools equipment includes drill bits, grinders, various saws, polisher
pads, routers bits, laser products. Lawn and garden products include work
gloves, pruners, shears, and related accessories. Home products are comprised of
cable ties, scissors, calculators, magnifying glasses, flexible flashlights,
paint tools and cleaning brushes. Accessories and attachments for power tools
include drill bits, hammer bits, router bits, hacksaws and blades, circular saw
blades, jig and reciprocating saw blades, diamond blades, screwdriver bits and
quick-change systems, and worksite tool belts and bags. Consumer mechanics tools
include wrenches and sockets sets. Cargo control systems include ratchet
tie-down straps, cambuckle sets, tow ropes, bungee cord sets and cargo nets.
 
 Our products are sold throughout Canada. We contract the
services of a national manufacturer s agency who call on current and prospective
customers. The sales agency is fully trained in product knowledge and our sales
policies. We also sell our products on a wholesale basis via our website at
www.toolcachecanada.com, which has on-line ordering capability which is secure
and individualized to the respective customer.  
 On June 30, 2015, we decided that continuing the operations of
its wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited ( DSL ) would no longer be
economically feasible. All of the shares of DSL held by us were returned to DSL
for cancellation and as of June 30, 2015 we no longer held any interest in DSL.
 
  Cash Requirements   
 Based on our planned expenditures, we will require
approximately $30,000 over the next 12 months, which will be funded from our
operations. In order to improve our liquidity, we plan to pursue additional
equity financing from private investors or possibly a registered public
offering. We do not currently have any definitive arrangements in place for the
completion of any further private placement financings and there is no assurance
that we will be successful in completing any further private placement
financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then
we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our business activities and
administrative expenses in order to be within the amount of capital resources
that are available to us.  
 We have not investigated the availability of commercial loans
or other debt financing to supplement or meet our cash requirements. In the
uncertain event that any such debt financing alternatives were available to us
on acceptable terms, they would increase our liabilities and future cash
commitments.  
  Future Financings   
 We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares
and funding from directors and shareholders in order to continue to fund our
business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to
existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional
sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund
our operations and other activities.  
 11 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
stockholders.  
  Results of Operations   
 The following summary of our results of operations should be
read in conjunction with our financial statements for the quarter ended March
31, 2015, which are included herein.  
  Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014 
 
 Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2015
and March 31, 2014   are summarized as follows:  
 
 Our financial statements report a net loss of $76,737 for the
three month period ended March 31, 2015 compared to a net loss of $23,893 for
the three month period ended March 31, 2014. Our net loss has increased
primarily as a result of decreases in revenues and increases in selling,
marketing and administrative expenses.  
  Liquidity and Financial Condition   
  Working Capita l  
 
 Our total current assets as of March 31, 2015 were $212,125 as
compared to total current assets of $196,028 as of December 31, 2014. 
  Cash Flows   
 12 

Operating Activities   
 Net cash used in operating activities was $76,368 in the three
months ended March 31, 2015 compared with net cash used by operating activities
of $132,351 in the three months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease in use of
cash in operating activities is mainly attributed to decreases in inventories,
offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and amounts due
from related parties.  
  Financing Activities   
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $59,007 in the
three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $75,173 provided by financing
activities in the three months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease in cash
provided by financing activities was due to decreases net change in our line of
credit.  
  Going Concern   
 Our consolidated financial statements for the three month
period ended March 31, 2015 have been prepared on a going concern basis and
contain an additional explanatory paragraph which identifies issues that raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.  
 The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent
upon the continued financial support from its shareholders and note holders, the
ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue
operations, and ultimately the attainment of profitable operations. As at March
31, 2015, our company has not generated any revenues, has a working capital
deficit of $321,099, and has an accumulated deficit of $295,398 since inception.
These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our company s ability to
continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should our company be unable to continue as a going concern.  
  Critical Accounting Policies   
 The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States for interim financial information and with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ) instructions for companies filing Form 10-Q. In the
opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial
statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position as of March 31,
2015, and the results of operations and cash flows for the period then ended.
The financial data and other information disclosed in the notes to the interim consolidated
financial statements related to this period are unaudited. The results for the
three-month period ended March 31, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or the entire year ending
December 31, 2015. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have
been condensed pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
regulations and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
Therefore, these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the Company s annual audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2014, included in
the Company s Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2015 with the SEC.  
 13 

These financial statements and related notes are expressed in
US dollars. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited. All inter-company
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company s fiscal year-end is
December 31.

  Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are

filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
