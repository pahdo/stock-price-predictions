1.                                        BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
     
  Reference is made to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in Monster Beverage Corporation and Subsidiaries (the  Company ) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( Form 10-K ) for a summary of significant accounting policies utilized by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and other disclosures, which should be read in conjunction with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Form 10-Q ).  
     
  The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and regulations applicable to interim financial reporting.  They do not include all the information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The information set forth in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,  is unaudited and reflects all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments and which in the opinion of management are necessary to make the interim condensed consolidated financial statements not misleading.  Results of operations for periods covered by this report may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations for the full year.  
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  
     
   Adjustment      Subsequent to the issuance of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016, management concluded that its presentation of prepaid income taxes, deferred income taxes and income taxes payable should be adjusted to conform to its filed 2015 United States ( U.S. ) Federal income tax return. As a result of such adjustments, prepaid income taxes increased by $16.9 million, deferred income taxes decreased by $120.8 million and income taxes payable decreased by $103.9 million in the comparable condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.  
     
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company renamed and revised its reportable segments to reflect management s current view of the business and to align its external financial reporting with its operating and internal financial model. Historical segment information has been revised to reflect the effect of this change. See Note 17 for additional information about the Company s reporting segments.  
     
  2.                                        ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES  
     
   American Fruits   Flavors   
     
  On April 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner American Fruits   Flavors ( AFF ), in an asset acquisition that brought the Company s primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of the Company s most important flavors in perpetuity and further enhanced its flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities (the  AFF Transaction ). Pursuant to the terms of the AFF Transaction, the Company purchased AFF for $688.5 million in cash after adjustments.  
     
  The Company accounted for the AFF Transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805  Business Combinations .

The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value allocations of the AFF Transaction consideration:  

1    Represents proprietary formulas for the Company s principal products.   
     
  The fair value analysis has yet to progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement of the respective fair values. Accordingly, the respective fair value allocations are preliminary and are based on valuations derived from estimated fair value assumptions used by management. The Company expects to complete its fair value analysis at a level of detail necessary to finalize the underlying fair value allocation as soon as practicable, but no later than twelve months from the closing of the AFF Transaction. The final respective fair value allocations and the preliminary estimates of management may differ substantially. However, the impact of any such differences on the Company s financial position, results of operations and liquidity would not be material.  
     
  The Company determined the estimated fair values as follows:  
     
                        Flavor formulas (non-amortizing)   multi-period excess earnings method  
                        Flavor formulas (amortizing)   replacement cost method  
                        Customer relationships   multi-period excess earnings method  
                        Trademarks   relief-from-royalty method  
                        Inventory   comparative sales method and replacement cost method  
                        Property and equipment, net   replacement cost method  
                        Favorable leases   discounted cash flow method  
     
  The preliminary book value of the working capital (excluding inventory) approximates fair value.  
     
  The Company has determined goodwill in accordance with ASC 805-30-30-1,  Business Combinations,  which requires the recognition of goodwill for the excess of the aggregate consideration over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.

For tax purposes, the AFF Transaction was recorded as an asset purchase.  As such, the Company received a step-up in tax basis of the AFF assets, net, equal to the purchase price.  
     
  In accordance with Regulation S-X, pro forma unaudited condensed financial information for the AFF Transaction has not been provided as the impact of the transaction on the Company s financial position, results of operations and liquidity was not material.  
     
   The Coca-Cola Company   
     
  On June 12, 2015, the Company completed the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreements entered into with The Coca-Cola Company ( TCCC ) on August 14, 2014 (the  TCCC Transaction ), which provided for a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category.  
     
  In consequence of the TCCC Transaction, (1) the Company issued to TCCC 34,040,534 newly issued Company common shares representing approximately 16.7% of the total number of outstanding Company common shares (after giving effect to such issuance) at such time and TCCC appointed two individuals to the Company s Board of Directors, (2) TCCC transferred all of its rights in and to TCCC s worldwide energy drink business ( KO Energy ) to the Company, (3) the Company transferred all of its rights in and to its non-energy drink business ( Monster Non-Energy ) to TCCC, (4) the Company and TCCC amended the distribution coordination agreements previously existing between them to govern the transition of third parties  rights to distribute the Company s energy products in most territories in the U.S. to members of TCCC s distribution network, which consists of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottling/distribution partners, and (5) TCCC and one of its subsidiaries made an aggregate net cash payment to the Company of $2.15 billion, $125.0 million of which was held in escrow through June 17, 2016, subject to release upon the achievement of milestones relating to the transition of distribution rights to TCCC s distribution network.  
     
  Under the terms of the escrow agreement and the transition payment agreement entered into in connection therewith, if the distribution rights in the U.S. transitioned to TCCC s distribution network represented case sales in excess of the following percentages of a target case sale amount agreed to by the parties, amounts in the escrow fund in excess of the applicable amounts below would be released to the Company:  

As of September 30, 2016, distribution rights in the U.S. representing approximately 89% of the target case sales had been transitioned to TCCC s distribution network.  As a result, on the one-year anniversary of the closing of the TCCC Transaction, the then-remaining escrow amount of $125 million was released to TCCC. Going forward TCCC will directly pay to the Company the amounts described above that become payable as a result of future target case sale transitions.  The Company expects to transition sufficient additional distribution rights to receive all such amounts.  
     
  The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented as if the

TCCC Transaction had closed on January 1, 2015:  

1   Includes net sales of $69.9 million and net income of $27.4 million (tax affected) related to the acquired KO Energy assets for the three-months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  2   Includes net sales of $82.9 million and net income of $32.9 million (tax affected) related to the acquired KO Energy assets from June 12, 2015 (the date of acquisition) through September 30, 2015.  
     
  3   Includes results through June 12, 2015, the date the TCCC Transaction was finalized. The $100.6 million of net income for KO Energy for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, is presented before tax. The associated estimated provision for income taxes is included in the  Other  category. Net income for KO Energy includes only net revenues and direct operating expenses, rather than full  carve-out  financial statements, because such financial statements would not be meaningful given that it is not possible to provide a meaningful allocation of business unit and corporate costs, interest or tax in respect of KO Energy.  
     
  4   Includes results through June 12, 2015. Net income includes the gain recognized on the sale of Monster Non-Energy of $161.5 million.

Pro-Forma Adjustments   Other include the following:   

For purposes of the unaudited pro forma financial information, a combined U.S. Federal and state statutory tax rate of 38.5% has been used. This rate does not reflect the Company s expected effective tax rate, which includes other tax charges and benefits, and does not take into account any historical or possible future tax events that may impact the combined company.  
     
  The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for information purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the combined results of operations that the Company would have reported had the TCCC Transaction been completed as of the date and for the periods presented, and should not be taken as representative of the Company s consolidated results of operations following the completion of the TCCC Transaction. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not intended to project the future financial results of operations of the combined company. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect any cost savings, operational synergies or revenue enhancements that the combined company may achieve as a result of the TCCC Transaction, or the costs to combine the operations or costs necessary to achieve cost savings, operating synergies and revenue enhancements.  
     
  3.                                        RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) . The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-15 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The accounting standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-13 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, and certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods with early application permitted. The Company early adopted the standards update effective January 1, 2016, electing (i) retrospective adjustment in the statement of cash flows and (ii) continued recognition of stock compensation based on estimated forfeitures.  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities increased and net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $303.9 million, respectively, as a result of such retrospective adjustment. For the three-and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $3.5 million and $7.1 million of excess tax benefits in net income that previously would have been recorded in additional paid-in-capital. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . This update is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The amendments under the new guidance require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the classified balance sheets. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company adopted the standards update effective December 31, 2015, electing to apply it retrospectively to all periods presented.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory .  ASU No. 2015-11 requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. ASU No. 2014-09 requires that a company recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. In applying the new guidance, a company will (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU No. 2014-09 was to be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  However, on July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to approve a one-year deferral of the effective date. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1,

5.                                        FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  
     
  ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value are summarized below.  
     
                         Level 1:    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
     
                         Level 2:    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.  
     
                         Level 3:    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
     
  ASC 820 requires the use of observable market inputs (quoted market prices) when measuring fair value and requires a Level 1 quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever possible.  
     
  The following tables present the Company s held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost and the fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated among the appropriate levels within the fair value hierarchy at:

All of the Company s short-term investments are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  The Company s valuation of its Level 1 investments, which include money market funds, is based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical securities. The Company s valuation of its Level 2 investments, which include municipal securities, commercial paper, U.S. Treasuries, certificates of deposit, variable rate demand notes and U.S. government agency securities, is based on other observable inputs, specifically a market approach which utilizes valuation models, pricing systems, mathematical tools and other relevant information for the same or similar securities. The Company s valuation of its Level 2 foreign currency contracts is based on quoted market prices of the same or similar instruments, adjusted for counterparty risk. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 measurements during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015, and there were no changes in the Company s valuation techniques.

6.                                        DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  
     
  The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks related primarily to its foreign business operations. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries  non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. All foreign currency exchange contracts of the Company that were outstanding as of September 30, 2016 have terms of one month or less. The Company does not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.  
     
  The Company has not designated its foreign currency exchange contracts as hedge transactions under ASC 815. Therefore, gains and losses on the Company s foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized in interest and other (expense) income, net, in the condensed consolidated statements of income, and are largely offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying economically hedged item.  
     
  The notional amount and fair value of all outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets consist of the following at:

Amortizing intangibles primarily consist of customer relationships. All amortizing intangibles have been assigned an estimated finite useful life and such intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the number of years that approximate their respective useful lives, generally five to seven years. Total amortization expense recorded was $3.0 million and $1.8 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total amortization expense recorded was $7.7 million and $2.1 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  10.                                DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS  
     
  In accordance with ASC No. 420  Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , the Company expenses distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination occurs.

The Company incurred termination costs of $33.4 million and $220.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  In the normal course of business, amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating agreements with the Company s prior distributors, are accounted for as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years. Revenue recognized was $8.4 million and $8.2 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was no acceleration of deferred revenue in the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue recognized was $28.6 million and $54.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in the $28.6 million of revenue recognized for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, was $5.0 million related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of the Company s prior distributors who were sent notices of termination during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016.

  The Company had purchase commitments aggregating approximately $55.0 million at September 30, 2016, which represented commitments made by the Company and its subsidiaries to various suppliers of raw materials for the production of its products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year.

   Legal Proceedings   
     
   Litigation          The Company has been named a defendant in numerous personal injury lawsuits, claiming that the death or other serious injury of the plaintiffs was caused by consumption of Monster Energy  brand energy drinks. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege strict product liability, negligence, fraudulent concealment, breach of implied warranties and wrongful death. The Company believes that each complaint is without merit and plans a vigorous defense. The Company also believes that any damages, if awarded, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.  
     
   State Attorney General Inquiry      In July 2012, the Company received a subpoena from the Attorney General for the State of New York in connection with its investigation concerning the Company s advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of its Monster Energy  brand energy drinks. Production of documents pursuant to that subpoena was completed in approximately May 2014.  
     
  On August 6, 2014, the Attorney General for the State of New York issued a second subpoena seeking additional documents and the deposition of a Company employee. On September 8, 2014, the Company moved to quash the second subpoena in the Supreme Court, New York County. The motion was fully briefed and was argued on March 17, 2015.  No decision has been rendered. It is unknown what, if any, action the state attorney general may take against the Company, the relief which may be sought in the event of any such proceeding or whether such proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition or results of operations.

San Francisco City Attorney Litigation      On October 31, 2012, the Company received a written request for information from the City Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco concerning the Company s advertising and marketing of its Monster Energy  brand energy drinks and specifically concerning the safety of its products for consumption by adolescents. In a letter dated March 29, 2013, the San Francisco City Attorney threatened to bring suit against the Company if it did not agree to take the following five steps immediately: (i)  Reformulate its products to lower the caffeine content to safe levels   (ii)  Provide adequate warning labels  (iii)  Cease promoting over-consumption in marketing  (iv)  Cease use of alcohol and drug references in marketing  and (v)  Cease targeting minors.   
     
  (i) The Company Action   On April 29, 2013, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Monster Energy Company, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the San Francisco City Attorney (the  Company Action ) in United States District Court for the Central District of California (the  Central District Court ), styled  Monster Beverage Corp., et al. v. Dennis Herrera . The Company sought a declaration from the Central District Court that the San Francisco City Attorney s investigation and demands are impermissible and preempted, subject to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, are unconstitutional in that they violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments  prohibitions against compelled speech, content-based speech and commercial speech, are impermissibly void-for-vagueness and/or violate the Commerce Clause. On June 3, 2013, the City Attorney filed a motion to dismiss the Company Action, arguing in part that the complaint should be dismissed in light of the San Francisco Action (described below) filed on May 6, 2013. On August 22, 2013, the Central District Court granted in part and denied in part the City Attorney s motion. On October 17, 2013, the City Attorney filed a renewed motion to dismiss the Company Action and on December 16, 2013, the Central District Court granted the City Attorney s renewed motion, dismissing the Company Action. The Company filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit on December 18, 2013 and on May 17, 2016, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Central District Court s order.  
     
  (ii) The San Francisco Action   On May 6, 2013, the San Francisco City Attorney filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, civil penalties and restitution for alleged violation of California s Unfair Competition Law, Business   Professions Code sections 17200,  et seq., styled People Of The State Of California ex rel. Dennis Herrera, San Francisco City Attorney v. Monster Beverage Corporation , in San Francisco Superior Court (the  San Francisco Action ). The City Attorney alleges that the Company (1) mislabeled its products as a dietary supplement, in violation of California s Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law, California Health   Safety Code sections 109875,  et. seq .; (2) is selling an  adulterated  product because caffeine is not generally recognized as safe due to the alleged lack of scientific consensus concerning the safety of the levels of caffeine in the Company s products and (3) is engaged in unfair and misleading business practices because its marketing (a) does not disclose the health risks that energy drinks pose for children and teens, (b) fails to warn against and promotes unsafe consumption, (c) implicitly promotes mixing of energy drinks with alcohol or drugs and (d) is deceptive because it includes unsubstantiated claims about the purported special benefits of its  killer  ingredients and  energy blend.  The City Attorney sought a declaration that the Company has engaged in unfair and unlawful business acts and practices in violation of the Unfair Competition Law, an injunction from performing or proposing to perform any acts in violation of the Unfair Competition Law, restitution and civil penalties.  
     
  After a motion to strike filed by the Company was granted in part, on March 20, 2014, the City Attorney filed an amended complaint, adding allegations supporting the theory for relief as to which the Court had granted the motion to strike. On April 18, 2014, the Company filed a renewed motion to strike, as well as a motion asking the Court to bifurcate and/or stay claims relating to the safety of Monster Energy  brand energy drinks, pending resolution of the ongoing U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) investigation of the safety and labeling of food products to which caffeine is added. On May 22, 2014, the Court denied the Company s motion to strike and motion to bifurcate and/or stay claims relating to safety.

On September 5, 2014, the City Attorney filed a second amended complaint, adding Monster Energy Company as a defendant. The Company and Monster Energy Company filed answers to the second amended complaint on October 4, 2014 and November 10, 2014, respectively. Discovery is ongoing.  
     
  The Court has set the case for a bench trial which is scheduled to take place April 10-21, 2017.  
     
  The Company denies that it has violated the Unfair Competition Law or any other law and believes that the City Attorney s claims and demands are preempted and unconstitutional, as alleged in the action the Company filed in the Central District Court. The Company intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. At this time, no evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of potential loss can be expressed.  
     
  The actions or investigations described above have not progressed to a point where a reasonably possible range of losses associated with their ultimate outcome can be estimated at this time. If the final resolution of any such litigation or proceedings is unfavorable, the Company s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially affected.  
     
  In addition to the above matters, the Company has been named as a defendant in various false advertising putative class actions and in a private attorney general action. In these actions, plaintiffs allege that defendants misleadingly labeled and advertised Monster Energy  brand products that allegedly were ineffective for the advertised benefits (including, but not limited to, an allegation that the products do not hydrate as advertised because they contain caffeine). The plaintiffs further allege that the Monster Energy  brand products at issue are unsafe because they contain one or more ingredients that allegedly could result in illness, injury or death. In connection with these product safety allegations, the plaintiffs claim that the product labels did not provide adequate warnings and/or that the Company did not include sufficiently specific statements with respect to contra-indications and/or adverse reactions associated with the consumption of its energy drink products (including, but not limited to, claims that certain ingredients, when consumed individually or in combination with other ingredients, could result in high blood pressure, palpitations, liver damage or other negative health effects and/or that the products themselves are unsafe). Based on these allegations, the plaintiffs assert claims for violation of state consumer protection statutes, including unfair competition and false advertising statutes, and for breach of warranty and unjust enrichment. In their prayers for relief, the plaintiffs seek, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages, restitution, attorneys  fees and, in some cases, injunctive relief. The Company regards these cases and allegations as having no merit. Furthermore, the Company is subject to litigation from time to time in the normal course of business, including intellectual property litigation and claims from terminated distributors.  
     
  Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation, based on the facts known to the Company, management believes that such litigation in the aggregate will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.  
     
  The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that is accrued, if any, or in the amount of any related insurance reimbursements recorded. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet includes accrued loss contingencies of approximately $2.1 million.

13.                                TREASURY STOCK  
     
  On August 2, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock (the  August 2016 Repurchase Plan ). From August 2, 2016 to September 30, 2016, no shares had been repurchased under the August 2016 Repurchase Plan. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company purchased 0.1 million shares at an average purchase price of $142.82 per share, pursuant to the August 2016 Repurchase Plan.  
     
  On April 28, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to commence a  modified Dutch auction  tender offer to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. The repurchase was authorized under the Company s existing share repurchase authority and was funded with cash on hand.   The Company commenced the tender offer in May 2016. On June 15, 2016, the Company accepted for payment an aggregate of 12,820,512 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $156.00 per share, for a total amount of $2.0 billion (excluding commissions), which exhausted the availability under all previously authorized share repurchase plans.   Such shares of common stock are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016.  
     
  During the three-months ended September 30, 2016, 1,200 shares of common stock were purchased from employees in lieu of cash payments for options exercised or withholding taxes due for a total amount of $0.2 million. While such purchases are considered common stock repurchases, they are not counted as purchases against the Company s authorized share repurchase programs. Such shares are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016.  
     
  14.                                STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  
     
  The Company has two stock-based compensation plans under which shares were available for grant at September 30, 2016: the Monster Beverage Corporation 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the 2009 Monster Beverage Corporation Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors.

The excess tax benefit for tax deductions from non-qualified stock option exercises, disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively. The excess tax benefit for tax deductions from non-qualified stock option exercises, disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $7.1 million and $303.9 million, respectively. As a result of the Company s early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 effective January 1, 2016, the Company recorded excess tax benefits of $3.5 million and $7.1 million in net income for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016.  The excess tax benefits for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2015 of $3.6 million and $303.9 million, respectively, were recorded in additional paid-in-capital.  
     
    Stock Options    
     
  Under the Company s stock-based compensation plans, all stock options granted as of September 30, 2016 were granted at prices based on the fair value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date at which the non-employee s performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the assumptions included in the table below. The Company uses historical data to determine the exercise behavior, volatility and forfeiture rate of the options.  
     
  The following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted during:  

Expected Volatility   : The Company uses historical volatility as it provides a reasonable estimate of the expected volatility. Historical volatility is based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a period of time equivalent to the expected term of the option.  
     
   Risk-Free Interest Rate   : The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option.  
     
   Expected Term   : The Company s expected term represents the weighted-average period that the Company s stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on expected time to post-vesting exercise of options by employees. The Company uses historical exercise patterns of previously granted options to derive employee behavioral patterns used to forecast expected exercise patterns.

The following table summarizes the Company s activities with respect to its stock option plans as follows:  

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $59.21 per share and $51.14 per share, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $50.82 per share and $50.20 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9.1 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $30.6 million and $841.5 million, respectively.  
     
  Cash received from option exercises under all plans for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $2.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Cash received from option exercises under all plans for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $10.6 million and $43.6 million, respectively.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, there was $100.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested options granted to employees under the Company s share-based payment plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.  
     
    Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units    
     
  Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company s common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date.

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the resultant impact on the Company s effective tax rate would not be significant. It is expected that the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months will not be significant.

  17.                                SEGMENT INFORMATION  
     
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company renamed and revised its reportable segments to reflect management s current view of the business and to align its external financial reporting with its operating and internal financial model. Historical segment information has been revised to reflect the effect of this change.

The Company s Monster Energy  Drinks segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military.  
     
  The Company s   Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling  concentrates  and/or  beverage bases  to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners and water, which are then filled in authorized containers bearing the Company s respective trademarks and sold to customers directly (or in some cases through wholesalers or other bottlers). To a lesser extent, the Company s Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military.  
     
  Generally, the Monster Energy  Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating revenues, but lower per case gross profit margins than the Strategic Brands segment.  
     
  Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to a reportable segment have been allocated to  Corporate   Unallocated.  No asset information, other than goodwill and other intangible assets, has been provided for in the Company s reportable segments as management does not measure or allocate such assets on a segment basis.  
     
  The net revenues derived from the Company s reportable segments and other financial information related thereto for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

    Stock Repurchase    
     
  On April 28, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized us to commence a  modified Dutch auction  tender offer to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock (the  Stock Repurchase ). The Stock Repurchase was authorized under our existing share repurchase authority and was funded with cash on hand.   We commenced the tender offer in May 2016. On June 15, 2016, we accepted for payment an aggregate of 12,820,512 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $156.00 per share, for a total amount of $2.0 billion (excluding commissions), which exhausted the availability under all share repurchase plans.   Such shares of common stock are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016.  
     
    Acquisitions and Divestitures

Pursuant to the terms of the AFF Transaction, we purchased AFF for $688.5 million in cash.  
     
  We accounted for the AFF Transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805  Business Combinations .  Inventory purchased under the AFF Transaction was recorded at fair value.

  We have three operating and reportable segments, (i) Monster Energy  Drinks segment ( Monster Energy  Drinks ), which is comprised of our Monster Energy  drink products (previously the Finished Products segment) as well as Mutant  TM   Super Soda drink products, (ii) Strategic Brands ( Strategic Brands ), which include the various energy drink brands acquired from TCCC as a result of the TCCC Transaction (previously the Concentrate segment) and (iii) Other, ( Other ) the principal products of which include the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction as well as certain products acquired as part of the AFF Transaction that are sold to independent third-parties (the  AFF Products ).  
     
  During the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we continued to expand our existing energy drink portfolio and further develop our distribution markets. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we introduced the following products:  
     
                              Java Monster  Salted Caramel (January 2016)  
                              Monster Energy  Gronk (February 2016)  
                              Mutant  TM   Super Soda (September 2016)  
     
  In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products and/or product lines discontinued during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
     
  Our net sales of $788.0 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 represented record sales for our third fiscal quarter. The vast majority of our net sales are derived from our Monster Energy  brand energy drinks. Net sales of our Monster Energy  brand energy drinks were $707.4 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016.  Net sales of our Strategic Brands acquired as part of the TCCC Transaction were $72.1 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy  Drinks segment of approximately $1.6 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe and Mexico, partially offset by our operations in Japan. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $1.0 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe.

  Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize  push-pull  methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, personality endorsements (including from television and other well-known sports personalities), sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands.  
     
  We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time.  
     
  All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third-party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party.  
     
  Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $232.8 million and $207.8 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such sales were approximately 26% and 24% of gross sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales to customers outside the United States of approximately 2% for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to our operations in Europe and Mexico, partially offset by our operations in Japan.  
     
  Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, food service customers and the military. Gross sales to our various customer types for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such bottlers/distributors  sales to their own customers.

(including Sam s Club), Costco and certain Anheuser Busch distributors ( AB Distributors ). In February 2015, in accordance with our then existing agreements with the applicable AB Distributors, we sent notices of termination to the majority of the AB Distributors in the U.S. for the termination of their respective distribution agreements. The associated distribution rights relating to such terminated distribution agreements have been transitioned to TCCC s network of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottlers/distributors as of the effective date of termination of the affected AB Distributors  rights in the applicable territories. As of November 7, 2016, distribution rights in the U.S. representing approximately 89% of the target case sales have been transitioned to TCCC s distribution network. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. TCCC, through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the  TCCC Subsidiaries ), accounted for approximately 41% and 42% of our net sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. TCCC, through the TCCC Subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 43% and 41% of our net sales for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

    Results of Operations for the Three-Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three-Months Ended September 30, 2015.    
     
   Net Sales.

The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy  brand energy drinks represented approximately $20.7 million of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy  brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand.  Net sales of our Strategic Brands were $72.1 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with $69.9 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2015.

No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2016. Our net sales of $756.6 million for the comparative three-months ended September 30, 2015 were impacted by advance purchases made by our customers due to a pre-announced price increase that became effective on August 31, 2015 (the  Advance Purchases ) on certain of our Monster Energy  brand energy drinks. We estimate that net sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2015 were increased by approximately $11.0 million as a result of such advance purchases. Net sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, after adjusting comparative net sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2015 for the Advance Purchases, increased by 5.7%.  
     
  Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the Monster Energy  Drinks segment of approximately $1.6 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to our operations in Europe and Mexico, partially offset by our operations in Japan.

The overall average net sales per case (excluding AFF Products net sales of $5.7 million as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) increased to $9.45 for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, which was 1.5% higher than the average net sales per case of $9.31 for the three-months ended September 30, 2015. The higher average net sales price per case was primarily attributable to the changes in product mix.

The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 33.8% from 39.4% for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in the domestic production deduction and stock compensation deduction in the three-months ended September 30, 2016 as well as a one-time tax benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction.  
     
   Net Income   .

  Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 243.0 million cases for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately 35.9 million cases or 17.3% higher than case sales of 207.1 million cases for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The overall average net sales per case (excluding AFF Products net sales of $12.1 million as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.40 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, which was 6.3% lower than the average net sales per case of $10.03 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The lower net sales per case was primarily attributable to sales of concentrates and/or beverage bases in the Strategic Brands segment, which generally generate lower net operating revenues than those products within the Monster Energy    Drinks segment.  
     
  Net sales for the Monster Energy    Drinks segment were $2,075.5 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $142.0 million, or 7.3% higher than net sales of $1,933.5 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016. Our net sales for the Monster Energy    Drinks segment of $1,933.5 million for the comparative nine-months ended September 30, 2015, were impacted by the Advance Purchases on certain of our Monster Energy    brand energy drinks. We estimate that net sales for the Monster Energy    Drinks segment for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 were increased by approximately $11.0 million as a result of such advance purchases. Net sales for the Monster Energy    Drinks segment for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, after adjusting comparative net sales for the Monster Energy    Drinks segment for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 for the Advance Purchases, increased by 8.0%.  
     
  Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $208.0 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $125.1 million, or 150.9% higher than net sales of $82.9 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to September 30, 2015).  
     
  Net sales for the Other segment were $12.1 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of approximately $48.6 million, or 80.0% lower than net sales of $60.8 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Net sales for the Other segment for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 are comprised of sales of the AFF Products. Net sales for the Other segment for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 are comprised of sales of the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015 (effectively from January 1, 2015 to June 12, 2015).  
     
   Gross Profit.     Gross profit was $1,443.9 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $214.9 million, or 17.5% higher than the gross profit of $1,228.9 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 62.9% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 from 59.2% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $139.4 million and $125.1 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy    brand energy drinks and our Strategic Brands, respectively. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to (i) the Strategic Brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy    Drinks segment, (ii) no sales in the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 for the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, which generally had lower gross margins than the Monster Energy    Drinks segment, (iii) lower costs of certain raw materials, (iv) the r  aw material cost savings from the AFF Transaction   and (v) changes in product sales mix.  
     
   Operating Expenses   .  Total operating expenses were $610.3 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of approximately $114.9 million, or 15.8% lower than total operating expenses of $725.2 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to the $187.3 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations. To a lesser extent, the decrease in operating expenses was also due to decreased expenditures of $15.4 million of professional service costs and transaction expenses related to the TCCC Transaction as well as decreased expenditures of $6.5 million for distribution costs. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by increased expenditures of $19.6 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $16.4 million for professional service costs (exclusive of expenditures related to the Stock Repurchase, the AFF

  Transaction and the TCCC Transaction), including legal and accounting fees, increased payroll expenses of $17.2 million (of which $10.0 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $9.7 million decrease in payroll taxes due in part to payroll taxes related to the exercise of certain stock options in the nine-months ended September 30, 2015), increased expenditures of $7.6 million for other marketing expenses, $6.0 million of professional service costs and transaction expenses related to the Stock Repurchase and the AFF Transaction, increased expenditures of $5.8 million for commissions and increased expenditures of $4.1 million for premiums.  
     
   Contribution Margin.     Contribution margin for the Monster Energy    Drinks segment was $874.8 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $278.1 million, or 46.6% higher than contribution margin of $596.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in contribution margin for the Monster Energy    Drinks segment was primarily the result of the $187.3 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations as well as the $139.4 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy    brand energy drinks.  The increase in contribution margin for the Monster Energy    Drinks segment was partially offset by the $39.8 million of accelerated amortization of deferred revenue during the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 related to distributor terminations.  
     
  Contribution margin for the Strategic Brands segment was $127.2 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $72.8 million, or 133.9% higher than contribution margin of $54.4 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015 to September 30, 2015).  
     
  Contribution margin for the Other segment was $1.5 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to contribution margin of $165.4 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Included in contribution margin for the Other segment for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 was the $161.5 million gain on the sale of Monster Non-Energy.  
     
   Operating Income.     Operating income was $833.6 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $168.4 million, or 25.3% higher than operating income of $665.2 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to 36.3% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 from 32.0% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating income in dollars was primarily due to the $187.3 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations as well as the $214.9 million increase in gross profit. The increase in operating income was partially offset by the $161.5 million gain on the sale of Monster Non-Energy for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Operating income was $76.9 million and $50.2 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in relation to our operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.  
     
   Interest and Other Expense, net   .  Interest and other expense, net was $0.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to interest and other expense, net of $3.1 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Foreign currency transaction losses were $4.3 million and $5.0 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest income was $3.5 million and $1.5 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
   Provision for Income Taxes   .  Provision for income taxes was $293.2 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $39.2 million or 15.4% higher than the provision for income taxes of $254.1 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.  The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 35.2% from 38.4% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in the domestic production deduction and the stock compensation deduction in the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 as well as a one-time benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the release of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions in the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.

   Gross Sales**.     Gross sales were $913.3 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of approximately $50.9 million, or 5.9% higher than gross sales of $862.4 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy    brand energy drinks represented approximately $42.4 million of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy    brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. Gross sales of our Strategic Brands were $77.1 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with $77.7 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2015. Gross sales of our AFF Products were $5.7 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016. There were no gross sales of our AFF Products for the three-months ended September 30, 2015. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2016. Our gross sales of $862.4 million for the comparative three-months ended September 30, 2015, were impacted by the Advance Purchases on certain of our Monster Energy    brand energy drinks. We estimate that gross sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2015 were increased by approximately $12.0 million as a result of such advance purchases. Gross sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, after adjusting comparative gross sales for the three-months ended September 30, 2015 for the Advance Purchases, increased by 7.4%.  Promotional and other allowances, as described in the footnote below, were $125.3 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $19.6 million, or 18.5% higher than promotional and other allowances of $105.7 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2015.

   **Gross sales are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.   
     
  The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measure of gross sales with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net sales:  

***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company s bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company s bottlers/distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the bottler s/distributors  sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company s promotional allowance programs with its numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
   Cash flows provided by operating activities.     Cash provided by operating activities was $420.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $351.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $539.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $33.7 million of stock-based compensation and $29.9 million of depreciation and other amortization.

   Cash flows used in investing activities.    Cash used in investing activities was $266.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $408.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the $688.5 million purchase of AFF.  
     
  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the AFF Transaction and purchases of held-to-maturity investments. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable of purchases of held-to-maturity investments. For both the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments. For both the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment used for sales and administrative activities and certain leasehold improvements. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment (specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets) and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, we may also use cash to purchase additional      real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses.

   Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities.     We used $1,993.6 million of cash in financing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $931.3 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The cash flows used in financing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of the repurchases of our common stock. The cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily the result of the issuance of our common stock to TCCC during the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 in connection with the TCCC Transaction.  
     
  Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.  
     
   Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments.     At September 30, 2016, we had $341.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $267.2 million in short and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  
     
  Of our $341.5 million of cash and cash equivalents held at September 30, 2016, $206.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at September 30, 2016. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries other than to repay certain intercompany debt owed to our U.S. operations. Under current tax laws, if funds in excess of intercompany amounts owed were repatriated to our U.S. operations we would be required to accrue and pay additional income taxes on such excess funds at the tax rates then in effect.  
     
  We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and access to credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of capital assets, purchases of equipment and properties and purchases of shares of our common stock, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures, including the purchases of real property, are likely to be less than $150.0 million through September 30, 2017. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.

  The following represents a summary of the Company s contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of September 30, 2016:  

Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. 
     
    Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. 
     
  3 In September 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of approximately 49 acres of land, located in Rialto, CA, for a purchase price of approximately $39.1 million. The Company intends to build an approximately 1,000,000 square-foot building to replace its current leased warehouse and distribution facilities located in Corona, CA. The Company has entered into an approximately $36.8 million guaranteed maximum price construction contract for the construction of the building. 
     
  In addition, approximately $0.01 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of September 30, 2016. It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change within the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2016, we had no accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.  
     
   Sales   
     
  The table below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Data from any one or more quarters or periods is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.  
     
  Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume.  A  unit case  means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings).  Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates as if converted into finished products sold by us.  
     
  Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. However, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they may be less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. In addition, our continued growth internationally may further reduce the impact of seasonality. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, customers and distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in advertising and promotional expenses.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) . The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-15 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  
     
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . The accounting standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-13 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, and certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods with early application permitted. The Company early adopted the standards update effective January 1, 2016, electing (i) retrospective adjustment in the statement of cash flows and (ii) continued recognition of stock compensation based on estimated forfeitures.  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities increased and net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $303.9 million, respectively, as a result of such retrospective adjustment. For the three-and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $3.5 million and $7.1 million of excess tax benefits in net income that previously would have been recorded in additional paid-in-capital. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . This update is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The amendments under the new guidance require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the classified balance sheets. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company adopted the standards update effective December 31, 2015, electing to apply it retrospectively to all periods presented.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory .  ASU No. 2015-11 requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. ASU No. 2014-09 requires that a company recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. In applying the new guidance, a company will (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the contract s performance obligations; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU No. 2014-09 was to be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  However, on July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to approve a one-year deferral of the effective date. This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and can be adopted using either a full retrospective or modified approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2014-09 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
