  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
   
  Note 1   Basis of Presentation 
  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10 Q.  Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual year-end financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal, recurring nature. The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from audited financial statements included in the Company s   2015   filing on Form 10-K.  Operating results for the   nine   and   three months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  The accounting and reporting policies of MVB Financial Corp. ( the Company  or  MVB ) and its subsidiary ( Subsidiary ),  MVB Bank, Inc. (the  Bank ), the Bank s subsidiaries Potomac Mortgage Group, Inc., which does business as MVB Mortgage ( MVB Mortgage ) and MVB Insurance, LLC ("MVB Insurance"), conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and practices in the banking industry. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates, such as the allowance for loan losses, are based upon known facts and circumstances. Estimates are revised by management in the period such facts and circumstances change.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the company s   December 31, 2015  , Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  In certain instances, amounts reported in prior periods  consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Specifically, a portion of the prior periods  interest income and interest expense was classified as gain on loans held for sale and has been reclassified in the current presentation. 
  All financial information is reported on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding discontinued operations. 
  Information is presented in these notes with dollars expressed in thousands, unless otherwise noted or specified. 
   
  Note 2   Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
  In   August 2016  , the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   The ASU provides guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLIs) (including bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLIs)); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. For public companies, this update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after   December 15, 2017  , including all interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In   June 2016  , the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326):     Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The ASU requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost should be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The allowance for credit losses should reflect management s current estimate of credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of a financial asset. This is in contrast to existing guidance whereby credit losses generally are not recognized until they are incurred. For public companies, this update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after   December 15, 2019  , including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In   March 2016  , the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-

based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after   December 15, 2016  , and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In   March 2016  , the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 ), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard. ASU 2016-08 clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (i.e. the specified good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and have similar effective dates and transition requirements (i.e., effective for annual reporting periods beginning after   December 15, 2017  , including interim reporting periods therein). The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In   February 2016  , the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The FASB issued this ASU to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after   December 15, 2018  . Early application of this ASU is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In   January 2016  , the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Accounting for Financial Instruments   Overall: Classification and Measurement (Subtopic 825-10)   ( ASU 2016-01 ). Amendments within ASU 2016-01 that relate to non-public entities have been excluded from this presentation. The amendments in this ASU 2016-01 address the following: 1) require equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 2) simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily-determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; 3) eliminate the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; 4) require entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; 5) require separate presentation in other comprehensive income for the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; 6) require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and 7) clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after   December 15, 2017  , and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this amendment to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements as it relates to accounting for financial instruments. 
  In   September 2015  , the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   ( ASU 2015-16 ). The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to estimated amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the estimated amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments also require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the estimated amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after   December 15, 2015  , including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. As such, the adoption of ASU 2015-15 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In   February 2015  , the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-2 ).  The amendments modify the evaluation reporting organizations must perform to determine if certain legal entities should be consolidated as VIEs. Specifically, the amendments: (1) Modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities; (2) Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (3) Affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and (4) Provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance

for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after   December 15, 2015  . The Company has evaluated the provisions of ASU 2015-02 and determined the new standard has no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In   May 2014  , the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-9 ). These amendments affect any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g. insurance contracts or lease contracts). This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance, and creates a Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after   December 15, 2017  , including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. The ASU allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. We are evaluating the transition method that will be elected and the potential effects of the adoption of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Note 3   Investments 
  Prior to the final determination of Basel III, investments were recorded as held-to-maturity due to the uncertainty of the capital treatment of available-for-sale investments. Upon the issuance of the final ruling, the Company opted out of the Other Comprehensive Income treatment of available-for-sale investments permitted under Basel III. Due to the change in capital treatment under the final ruling of Basel III, the Company s purpose of recording investments as held-to-maturity changed; therefore, during the period ended   March 31, 2016  , the Company reclassified   $52.4 million  , with unrealized holding gains of   $1.8 million  , of the remaining held-to-maturity investments into available-for-sale investments. 
  There were   no   investment securities held-to-maturity at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Amortized cost and fair values of investment securities held-to-maturity at   December 31, 2015  , including gross unrealized gains and losses, are summarized as follows: 

Amortized cost and fair values of investment securities available-for-sale at   September 30, 2016   are summarized as follows:

Amortized cost and fair values of investment securities available-for-sale at   December 31, 2015   are summarized as follows: 

The following tables summarize amortized cost and fair values of debt securities by maturity at   September 30, 2016  : 

Investment securities with a carrying value of   $97.5 million   at   September 30, 2016  , were pledged to secure public funds, repurchase agreements and potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve discount window. 
  The Company's investment portfolio includes securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016  , the details of which are included in the following table.  Although these securities, if sold at   September 30, 2016   would result in a pretax loss of   $527 thousand   the Company has no intent to sell the applicable securities at such fair values, and maintains the Company has the ability to hold these securities until all principal has been recovered. It is not more likely than not the Company would sell any securities at a loss for liquidity purposes. Declines in the fair values of these securities can be traced to general market conditions which reflect the prospect for the economy as a whole.  When determining other-than-temporary impairment on securities, the Company considers such factors as adverse conditions specifically related to a certain security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area, the time frame securities have been in an unrealized loss position, the Company s ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value, whether or not the security has been downgraded by a rating agency, and whether or not the financial condition of the security issuer has severely deteriorated.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company considers all securities with unrealized loss positions to be temporarily impaired, and consequently, does not believe the Company will sustain any material realized losses as a result of the current temporary decline in market value. 
  The following table discloses investments in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016  :

The following table discloses investments in an unrealized loss position at   December 31, 2015  : 

For the   three   month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company sold investments available-for-sale of   $15.7 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively, resulting in gross gains of   $479 thousand   and   $4 thousand  , respectively, and gross losses of   $0   and   $0  , respectively.    
  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company sold investments available-for-sale of   $55.2 million   and   $12.9 million  , respectively, resulting in gross gains of   $1.1 million   and   $125 thousand  , respectively, and gross losses of   $2 thousand   and   $0  , respectively. 
  The Company sold   no   held-to-maturity investments during the   three   month period ended   September 30, 2016   and sold investments held-to maturity of   $421 thousand  , resulting in gross gains of   $5 thousand   and   no   gross losses, during the   three   month period ended   September 30, 2015  . The held-to-maturity investment was sold due to a credit downgrade. 
   
  Note 4   Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses 
  All loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized over the life of the loan. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net deferred fees of   $796 thousand   and   $1.2 million  , respectively, were included in the carrying value of loans.  
  An allowance for loan losses ( ALL ) is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio.  The ALL is based on management s continuing evaluation of the risk characteristics and credit quality of the loan portfolio, assessment of current economic conditions, diversification and size of the portfolio, adequacy of collateral, past and anticipated loss experience, and the amount of non-performing loans. 
  The Bank s methodology for determining the ALL is based on the requirements of ASC Section 310-10-35 for loans individually evaluated for impairment (discussed above) and ASC Subtopic 450-20 for loans collectively evaluated for impairment, as well as the Interagency Policy Statements on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and other bank regulatory guidance.  The total of the two components represents the Bank s ALL. 
  Loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are analyzed with general allowances being made as appropriate.  For general allowances, historical loss trends are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio.  These historical loss amounts are modified by qualified factors. 
  The segments as presented in this note, which are based on the Federal call code assigned to each loan, provide the starting point for the ALL analysis.  Company and Bank management tracks the historical net charge-off activity at the call code level.  A historical charge-off factor is calculated utilizing a defined number of consecutive historical quarters.  All pools currently utilize a rolling   12   quarters. 
   Pass  rated credits are segregated from  Criticized  credits for the application of qualitative factors.  Loans in the criticized pools, which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues, are closely monitored by management and subject to additional qualitative factors. 
  Company and Bank management have identified a number of additional qualitative factors which it uses to supplement the historical charge-off factor because these factors are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing loan pools to differ from historical loss experience.  The additional factors that are evaluated quarterly and updated using information obtained from internal, regulatory, and governmental sources are:  national and local economic trends and conditions; levels of and trends in delinquency rates and non-accrual loans; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in lending policies; experience, ability, and depth of lending staff; value of underlying collateral; and concentrations of credit from a loan type, industry and/or geographic standpoint. The combination of historical charge-off and qualitative factors are then weighted for each risk grade. These weightings are determined internally based upon the likelihood of loss as a loan risk grading deteriorates.

To estimate the liability for off-balance sheet credit exposures, Bank management analyzed the portfolios of letters of credit, non-revolving lines of credit, and revolving lines of credit, and based its calculation on the expectation of future advances of each loan category. Letters of credit were determined to be highly unlikely to advance since they are generally in place only to ensure various forms of performance of the borrowers. In the Bank s history, there have been no letters of credit drawn upon. In addition, many of the letters of credit are cash secured and do not warrant an allocation. Non-revolving lines of credit were determined to be highly likely to advance as these are typically construction lines. Meanwhile, the likelihood of revolving lines of credit advancing varies with each individual borrower. Therefore, the future usage of each line was estimated based on the average line utilization of the revolving line of credit portfolio as a whole. 
  Once the estimated future advances were calculated, an allocation rate, which was derived from the Bank s historical losses and qualitative environmental factors, was applied in the similar manner as those used for the allowance for loan loss calculation. The resulting estimated loss allocations were totaled to determine the liability for unfunded commitments related to these loans. The liability for unfunded commitments was   $224 thousand   and   $194 thousand   respectively as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Bank management reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis using a defined, consistently applied process in order to make appropriate and timely adjustments to the ALL.  When information confirms all or part of specific loans to be uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged off against the ALL. 
  The allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and actual losses will vary from current estimates.  Management believes that the granularity of the homogeneous pools and the related historical loss ratios and other qualitative factors, as well as the consistency in the application of assumptions, result in an ALL that is representative of the risk found in the components of the portfolio at any given date. 
  The following tables summarize the primary segments of the ALL, segregated into the amount required for loans individually evaluated for impairment and the amount required for loans collectively evaluated for impairment as of   September 30, 2016  :

The following table summarizes the primary segments of the Company loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2015  : 

Loans are considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Factors considered by management in evaluating impairment include current risk grade payment status and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due.  Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.  The Company also separately evaluates individual consumer loans for impairment. The Chief Credit Officer identifies these loans individually by monitoring the delinquency status of the Bank s portfolio. Once identified, the Bank s ongoing communications with the borrower allow Management to evaluate the significance of the payment delays and the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower. 
  Once the determination has been made that a loan is impaired, the determination of whether a specific allocation of the allowance is necessary is measured by comparing the recorded investment in the loan to the fair value of the loan using one of three methods:  (a) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (b) the loan s observable market price; or (c) the fair value of the collateral less selling costs.  The method is selected on a loan-by-loan basis, with management primarily utilizing the fair value of collateral method.  The evaluation of the need and amount of a specific allocation of the allowance and whether a loan can be removed from impairment status is made on a quarterly basis. 
  During   December 2013  , the Bank purchased   $74.3 million   in performing commercial real estate secured loans in the northern Virginia area. At the time of acquisition, none of these loans were considered impaired. They were acquired at a premium of roughly   1.024   or   $1.8 million  , which is being amortized in accordance with ASC 310-20. These loans are collectively evaluated for impairment under ASC 450. The loans continue to be individually monitored for payoff activity, and any necessary adjustments to the premium are made accordingly. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these balances totaled   $25.8 million   and   $46.8 million  , respectively. Of the   $48.5 million   decrease since originally purchased, MVB refinanced   $19.6 million  , sold participations totaling   $7.5 million   and sold   $9.7 million   back to the institution from which the loans were originally purchased in   December 2013  . The remainder of the decrease was the result of principal paydowns. The weighted average yield on the remaining portfolio is   5.91%  .

The following table presents impaired loans by class, segregated by those for which a specific allowance was required and those for which a specific allowance was not necessary as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (Dollars in thousands): 

Impaired loans have decreased by   $3.6 million  , or   23%   during the first   nine   months of   2016  , primarily the result of the net impact of   four   commercial loans. A   $5.0 million   loan to finance commercial real estate property in the Northern Virginia market, which had as primary tenants, government contractors that have vacated the premises as a result of losing significant contracts with the United States government, was purchased from another financial institution in   late 2013  . In the   first quarter of 2016  , this   $5.0 million   loan was repurchased by the selling financial institution thereby decreasing total impaired loans by   $5.0 million  . In contrast, a   $1.8 million   commercial real estate loan (net of a   $619 thousand   participation) was identified as impaired in the   first quarter of 2016   as a result of an extended stabilization and interest only period, as well as a lack of project specific cash flows. A charge-off of   $535 thousand   was incurred on this loan in the   second quarter of 2016  . The remaining   two   loans that caused the most significant change to total impaired loans in   2016  , which are related commercial loans within a single relationship, totaled   $1.0 million   and were identified as impaired in the   second quarter of 2016   as a result of a decline in the coal industry. In the   third quarter of 2016  , these   two   loans, along with a third related loan that was previous impaired, required orderly liquidation of the related collateral, resulting in   $435 thousand   in principal curtailment and a total of partial charge offs in the amount of   $679 thousand  . The net effect of these three significant impairment items was   $4.0 million  . The remaining   $400 thousand   of the decrease in impaired loans since   December 31, 2015   was the net effect of multiple other factors, including the identification of   ten   impaired commercial loans with a total balance of   $855 thousand  , the identification of   two   impaired installment loans with a total balance of   $368 thousand  ,  the identification of   one   impaired home equity line of credit with a balance of   $23 thousand  , a total of   $630 thousand   in partial charge-offs related to these various loans, the foreclosure upon a   $127 thousand   impaired residential real estate loan, and normal loan amortization.

The following tables present the average recorded investment in impaired loans and related interest income recognized for the periods indicated (Dollars in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank held   two   foreclosed residential real estate properties representing   $158 thousand  , or   66%  , of the total balance of other real estate owned. There are   five   additional consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate properties in the process of foreclosure. The total recorded investment in these loans was   $529 thousand   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Bank management uses a   nine   point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio.  The first   six   categories are considered not criticized, and are aggregated as  Pass  rated.  The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions.  The Special Mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak, resulting in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a Substandard classification.  Loans in the Substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. Any portion of a loan that has been or is expected to be charged off is placed in the Loss category. 
  To help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Bank has a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight.  Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as past due status, bankruptcy,

repossession, or death occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event.  The Bank s Chief Credit Officer is responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans in the portfolio at origination and on an ongoing basis.  The Credit Department ensures that a review of all commercial relationships of one million dollars or greater is performed annually. 
  Review of the appropriate risk grade is included in both the internal and external loan review process, and on an ongoing basis.  The Bank has an experienced Credit Department that continually reviews and assesses loans within the portfolio.  The Bank engages an external consultant to conduct independent loan reviews on at least an annual basis.  Generally, the external consultant reviews larger commercial relationships or criticized relationships.  The Bank s Credit Department compiles detailed reviews, including plans for resolution, on loans classified as Substandard on a quarterly basis.  Loans in the Special Mention and Substandard categories that are collectively evaluated for impairment are given separate consideration in the determination of the allowance. 
  The following table represents the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the aggregate Pass and the criticized categories of Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful within the internal risk rating system as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (Dollars in thousands): 

Management further monitors the performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio by analyzing the age of the portfolio as determined by the length of time a recorded payment is past due.  
  A loan that has deteriorated and is in a collection process could warrant non-accrual status. A thorough review is to be presented to the Chief Credit Officer and or the Management Loan Committee ("MLC"), as required with respect to any loan which is in a collection process and to make a determination as to whether the loan should be placed on non-accrual status. The placement of loans on non-accrual status will be subject to applicable regulatory restrictions and guidelines. Generally, loans should be placed in non-accrual status when the loan approaches 90 days past due, when it becomes likely the borrower cannot or will not make scheduled principal or interest payments, when full repayment of principal and interest is not expected, or when the loan displays potential loss characteristics. Normally, all accrued interest should be charged off when a loan is placed in non-accrual status. Any payments subsequently received should be applied to principal. To remove a loan from non-accrual status, all principal and interest due must be paid up to date and the Bank is reasonably sure of future satisfactory payment performance. Usually, this requires a six-month recent history of payments due. Removal of a loan from non-accrual status will require the approval of the Chief Credit Officer and or MLC.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  The restructuring of a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) if both (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and (ii) the creditor has granted a concession.  Concessions may include interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, principal forgiveness, restructuring amortization schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had specific reserve allocations for TDR s of   $292 thousand   and   $672 thousand  , respectively. 
  Loans considered to be troubled debt restructured loans totaled   $8.4 million   and   $9.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   $6.0 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively, represent accruing troubled debt restructured loans and represent   51%   and   46%  , respectively of total impaired loans, Meanwhile,   $2.6 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, represent   three   loans to   two   borrowers that have defaulted under the restructured terms. All   three   loans are commercial acquisition and development loans that were considered restructured due to extended interest only periods and/or unsatisfactory repayment structures once transitioned to principal and interest payments. These borrowers have experienced continued financial difficulty and are considered non-performing loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   Two   additional restructured loans, a   $214 thousand   commercial real estate loan and a   $348 thousand   mortgage loan, are considered non-performing as of   September 30, 2016  . Both of these loans were also considered restructured due to extended interest only periods and/or unsatisfactory repayment structures. 
  There were   no   new TDR s for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  Note 5   Borrowed Funds 
  Short-term Borrowings 
  Along with traditional deposits, the Bank has access to short-term borrowings from FHLB to fund its operations and investments. Short-term borrowings from FHLB totaled   $132.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $179.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

Repurchase agreements: 
  Along with traditional deposits, the Bank has access to securities sold under agreements to repurchase  repurchase agreements  with customers represent funds deposited by customers, on an overnight basis, that are collateralized by investment securities owned by the Company. Repurchase agreements with customers are included in borrowings section on the consolidated balance sheets. All repurchase agreements are subject to terms and conditions of repurchase/security agreements between the Company and the client and are accounted for as secured borrowings. The Company's repurchase agreements reflected in liabilities consist of customer accounts and securities which are pledged on an individual security basis. 
  The Company monitors the fair value of the underlying securities on a monthly basis. Repurchase agreements are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction and included in Securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the consolidated balance sheets.  The primary risk with our repurchase agreements is market risk associated with the investments securing the transactions, as we may be required to provide additional collateral based on fair value changes of the underlying investments. Securities pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements are maintained with our safekeeping agents. 
  All of the Company s repurchase agreements were overnight agreements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . These borrowings were collateralized with investment securities with a carrying value of   $28.0 million   and   $28.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and were comprised of U.S. Government Agencies and Mortgage backed securities. Declines in the value of the collateral would require the Company to increase the amounts of securities pledged. 
  Repurchase agreements totaled   $27.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $27.4 million   at December 31, 2015.

Subordinated Debt 
  Information related to subordinated debt is summarized as follows: 

In   March 2007  , the Company completed the private placement of   $4 million   Floating Rate, Trust Preferred Securities through its MVB Financial Statutory Trust I subsidiary (the  Trust ).  The Company established the trust for the sole purpose of issuing the Trust Preferred Securities pursuant to an Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust.  The proceeds from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities were loaned to the Company under subordinated Debentures (the  Debentures ) issued to the Trust pursuant to an Indenture.  The Debentures are the only asset of the Trust.  The Trust Preferred Securities have been issued to a pooling vehicle that will use the distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities to securitize note obligations.  The obligations of the Company with respect to the issuance of the trust preferred securities constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the Trust s obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities to the extent set forth in the related guarantees. The securities issued by the Trust are includable for regulatory purposes as a component of the Company s Tier I capital. 
  The Trust Preferred Securities and the Debentures mature in   2037   and have been redeemable by the Company since   2012  .  Interest payments are due in   March, June, September and December   and are adjusted at the interest due dates at a rate of   1.62%   over the   three month LIBOR Rate  . The obligations of the Company with respect to the issuance of the trust preferred securities constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the Trust's obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities to the extent set forth in the related guarantees. 
  On   June 30, 2014  , MVB Financial Corp. (the  Company ) issued its Convertible Subordinated Promissory Notes Due   2024   (the  Notes ) to various investors in the aggregate principal amount of   $29,400,000  .  The Notes were issued in   $100,000   increments per Note subject to a minimum investment of   $1,000,000  .  The Notes expire   10 years   after the initial issuance date of the Notes (the  Maturity Date ).  
  Interest on the Notes accrues on the unpaid principal amount of each Note (paid quarterly in arrears on   January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1   of each year) which rate shall be dependent upon the principal invested in the Notes and the holder s ownership of common stock in the Company.  For investments of less than   $3,000,000   in Notes, an ownership of Company common stock representing at least   30%   of the principal of the Notes acquired, the interest rate on the Notes is   7%   per annum.  For investments of   $3,000,000   or greater in Notes and ownership of the Company s common stock representing at least   30%   of the principal of the Notes acquired, the interest rate on the Notes is   7.5%   per annum.  For investments of   $10,000,000   or greater, the interest rate on the Notes is   7%   per annum, regardless of whether the holder owns or acquires MVB common stock.  The principal on the Notes shall be paid in full at the Maturity Date.  On the fifth anniversary of the issuance of the Notes, a holder may elect to continue to receive the stated fixed rate on the Notes or a floating rate determined by LIBOR plus   5%   up to a maximum rate of   9%  , adjusted quarterly. 
  The Notes are unsecured and subject to the terms and conditions of any senior debt and after consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Company may, after the Notes have been outstanding for   five years  , and without premium or penalty, prepay all or a portion of the unpaid principal amount of any Note together with the unpaid interest accrued on such portion of the principal amount of such Note.  All such prepayments shall be made pro rata among the holders of all outstanding Notes.  
  At the election of a holder, any or all of the Notes may be converted into shares of common stock during the   30  -day period after the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the issuance of the Notes or upon a notice to prepay by the Company.  The Notes will convert into common stock based on   $16   per share of the Company s common stock.  The conversion price will be subject to anti-dilution adjustments for certain events such as stock splits, reclassifications, non-cash distributions, extraordinary cash dividends, pro rata repurchases of common stock, and business combination transactions.  The Company must give   20 days    notice to the holders of the Company s intent to prepay the Notes, so that holders may execute the conversion right set forth above if a holder so desires.

     Table of Contents  

Repayment of the Notes is subordinated to the Company s outstanding senior debt including (if any) without limitation, senior secured loans.  No payment will be made by the Company, directly or indirectly, on the Notes, unless and until all of the senior debt then due has been paid in full.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as there exists no event of default under any senior debt, the Company would make, and a holder would receive and retain for the holder s account, regularly scheduled payments of accrued interest and principal pursuant to the terms of the Notes. 
  The Company must obtain a consent of the holders of the Notes prior to issuing any new senior debt in excess of   $15,000,000   after the date of issuance of the Notes and prior to the Maturity Date.  
  An event of default will occur upon the Company s bankruptcy or any failure to pay interest, principal, or other amounts owing on the Notes when due. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default (but subject to the subordination provisions of the Notes) the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes may declare all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes due and payable and demand immediate payment of such amount. 
  The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed on any interest payment date after a date   five years   from the original issue date. 
  The Company reflects subordinated debt in the amount of   $33.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Interest expense was   $1.7 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Note 6   Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The following summarizes the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments. 
  Level I:      Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. 
  Level II:     Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.  The nature of these assets and liabilities include items for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, and items that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed. 
  Level III:    Assets and liabilities that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date.  These items do not have two-way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. 
  Assets Measured on a Recurring Basis 
  As required by accounting standards, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The Company classified investments in government securities as Level 2 instruments and valued them using the market approach.  The following measurements are made on a recurring basis. 

21 

     Table of Contents  

Available-for-sale investment securities     Available-for-sale investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities and private label entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. There have been no changes in valuation techniques for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Valuation techniques are consistent with techniques used in prior periods. 
    Loans held for sale         Loans held for sale are carried at fair value. These loans currently consist of one-to-four-family residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Fair value is based on the committed market rates or the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data. 
    Interest rate lock commitment     For mortgage interest rate locks, the fair value is based on either (i) the price of the underlying loans obtained from an investor for loans that will be delivered on a best efforts basis or (ii) the observable price for individual loans traded in the secondary market for loans that will be delivered on a mandatory basis less (iii) expected costs to deliver the interest rate locks, any expected  pull through rate  is applied to this calculation to estimate the derivative value.  
    Interest rate cap     The fair value of the interest rate cap is determined at the end of each quarter by using Bloomberg Finance which values the interest rate cap using observable inputs from forward and futures yield curves as well as standard market volatility. 
    Interest rate swap     Interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value based on third party vendors who compile prices from various sources and may determine fair value of identical or similar instruments by using pricing models that consider observable market data.  
    Forward sales commitments     Forward sales commitments are considered derivatives and are recorded at fair value, based on (i) committed sales prices from investors for commitments to sell mortgage loans or (ii) observable market data inputs for commitments to sell mortgage backed securities. A majority of the interest rate locks and loans held for sale are committed on a best efforts basis. 
  The following tables present the assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   by level within the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table represents recurring level III assets: 

Assets Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain financial assets, financial liabilities, non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market value that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. Certain non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include foreclosed assets (upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment), non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities measured at fair value in the second step of a goodwill impairment test, and intangible assets and other non-financial long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment. Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during   2016   and   2015   include certain foreclosed assets which, upon initial recognition, were remeasured and reported at fair value through a charge-off to the allowance for possible loan losses and certain foreclosed assets which, subsequent to their initial recognition, were remeasured at fair value through a write-down included in other non-interest expense. 
    Impaired Loans -   Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment using one of several methods, including collateral value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. Collateral values are estimated using Level 2 inputs based on observable market data or Level 3 inputs based on customized discounting criteria. For a majority of impaired real estate related loans, the Company obtains a current external appraisal. Other valuation techniques are used as well, including internal valuations, comparable property analysis and contractual sales information. 
    Other Real Estate owned     Other real estate owned, which is obtained through the Bank s foreclosure process is valued utilizing the appraised collateral value. Collateral values are estimated using Level 2 inputs based on observable market data or Level 3 inputs based on customized discounting criteria. At the time, the foreclosure is completed, the Company obtains a current external appraisal.

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are included in the tables below: 

The following tables present quantitative information about the Level 3 significant unobservable inputs for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

(1) Fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally include various level 3 inputs which are not observable. 
  (2) Appraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses.  The range and weighted average of liquidation expenses and other appraisal adjustments are presented as a percent of the appraisal. 
  The following summarizes the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments. 
  Cash and cash equivalents:   The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because they have original maturities of 90 days or less and do not present unanticipated credit concerns. 
  Certificates of deposits:   The fair values for certificates of deposits are computed based on scheduled future cash flows of principal and interest, discounted at interest rates currently offered for certificates of deposits with similar terms of investors.    No   prepayments of principal are assumed.

     Table of Contents  

Securities:    Fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices, where available.  If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities. 
  Loans held for sale:   Loans held for sale are reported at fair value. These loans currently consist of one-to-four-family residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Fair value is based on committed market rates or the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data. (Level II) 
  Loans:    The fair values for loans are computed based on scheduled future cash flows of principal and interest, discounted at interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms of borrowers of similar credit quality.  No prepayments of principal are assumed. 
  Mortgage servicing rights:   The carrying value of mortgage servicing rights approximates their fair value. 
  Interest rate lock commitment:   For mortgage interest rate locks, the fair value is based on either (i) the price of the underlying loans obtained from an investor for loans that will be delivered on a best efforts basis or (ii) the observable price for individual loans traded in the secondary market for loans that will be delivered on a mandatory basis less (iii) expected costs to deliver the interest rate locks, any expected  pull through rate  is applied to this calculation to estimate the derivative value.     The  pull through rate  range from   78%       82%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Interest rate cap:   The fair value of the interest rate cap is determined at the end of each quarter by using Bloomberg Finance which values the interest rate cap using observable inputs from forward and futures yield curves as well as standard market volatility. 
  Interest rate swap:   Interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value based on third party vendors who compile prices from various sources and may determine fair value of identical or similar instruments by using pricing models that consider observable market data.  
  Accrued interest receivable and payable and repurchase agreements:    The carrying values of accrued interest receivable and payable and repurchase agreements approximate their fair values. 
  Deposits:    The fair values of demand deposits (i.e., non-interest bearing checking, NOW and money market), savings accounts and other variable rate deposits approximate their carrying values.  Fair values of fixed maturity deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology at rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.  Any intangible value of long-term relationships with depositors is not considered in estimating the fair values disclosed. 
  Forward Sales Commitments:   Forward sales commitments are used to mitigate interest rate risk for residential mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate locks and manage expected funding percentages. These instruments are considered derivatives and are recorded at fair value, based on (i) committed sales prices from investors for commitments to sell mortgage loans or (ii) observable market data inputs for commitments to sell mortgage backed securities. 
  FHLB and other borrowings:   The fair values for loans are computed based on scheduled future cash flows of principal and interest, discounted at interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms of borrowers of similar credit quality.  No prepayments of principal are assumed. 
  Subordinated debt:   The fair values for debt are computed based on scheduled future cash flows of principal and interest, discounted at interest rates currently offered for debt with similar terms of borrowers of similar credit quality.  No prepayments of principal are assumed. 
  Off-balance sheet instruments:    The fair values of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of agreements and the present credit standing of the counterparties.  The amounts of fees currently charged on commitments and standby letters of credit are deemed insignificant, and therefore, the estimated fair values and carrying values are not shown.

     Table of Contents  

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instrument.  These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore, cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  Fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments  .

The Company issued   8,500   shares of   $1,000   per share preferred stock with dividends payable in arrears on   January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1   each year.

  Note 8       Net Income Per Common Share 
  The Company determines basic earnings per share by dividing net income less preferred stock dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined by dividing net income less dividends on convertible preferred stock plus interest on convertible subordinated debt by the weighted average number of shares outstanding increased by both the number of shares that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options under the Company s   2003   and   2013   Stock Incentive Plans and the conversion of preferred stock and subordinated debt if dilutive. Earnings per share available for the common shareholder has been corrected from prior year. The prior year calculation included convertible preferred stock in the dilutive calculations instead of the convertible subordinated debt. The net effect resulted in a decrease of one penny in dilutive earnings per share for both the   nine   and   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Introduction 
  MVB Financial Corp. was formed on   May 29, 2003   and became a bank holding company under the laws of West Virginia on   January 1, 2004  , and, effective   December 19, 2012  , became a financial holding company.

(an inactive subsidiary) were merged into the Company.

During the   fourth quarter of 2012  , the Bank acquired Potomac Mortgage Group, Inc.

  Currently, the Bank operates   thirteen   full-service banking branches in West Virginia and Virginia, which are located at:  301 Virginia Avenue in Fairmont, Marion County; 100 NASA Boulevard in Fairmont, Marion County; 1000 Johnson Avenue in Bridgeport, Harrison County; 406 West Main St. in Clarksburg, Harrison County; 88 Somerset Boulevard in Charles Town, Jefferson County; 651 Foxcroft Avenue in Martinsburg, Berkeley County; 704 Foxcroft Avenue in Martinsburg, Berkeley County; 5091 Gerrardstown Road in Inwood, Berkeley County; 2400 Cranberry Square in Cheat Lake, Monongalia County; 10  Sterling  Drive in Morgantown, Monongalia County; 231 Aikens Center in Martinsburg, Berkeley County; 400 Washington Street East in Charleston, Kanawha County; and 1801 Old Reston Avenue Reston, Fairfax County. 
  MVB Insurance was originally formed in 2000 and reinstated in 2005, as a Bank subsidiary. Effective   June 1, 2013  , MVB Insurance became a direct subsidiary of the Company. MVB Insurance offered select insurance products such as title insurance, individual insurance, commercial insurance, employee benefits insurance, and professional liability insurance. On   June 30, 2016  , the Company entered into an Asset Purchase agreement with USI Insurance Services ( USI ), in which USI purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of MVB Insurance, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of   $6.9 million  , and was reported in discontinued operations, as discussed in Note 12. MVB Insurance retained the assets related to, and continues to operate, its title insurance business. The title insurance business is immaterial in terms of revenue and the Company has reorganized MVB Insurance as a subsidiary of the Bank. 
  Subsequent to the sale of MVB Insurance, the Company s primary business activities, through its subsidiary, are currently community banking, and mortgage banking. As a community-based bank, the Bank offers its customers a full range of products through various delivery channels.  Such products and services include checking accounts, NOW accounts, money market and savings accounts, time certificates of deposit, commercial, installment, commercial real estate and residential real estate mortgage loans, debit cards, and safe deposit rental facilities.  Services are provided through our walk-in offices, automated teller machines ( ATMs ), drive-in facilities, and internet and telephone banking. Additionally, the Bank offers non-deposit investment products through an association with a broker-dealer.  Since the opening date of   January 4, 1999  , the Bank has experienced significant growth in assets, loans, and deposits due to strong community and customer support in the Marion County and Harrison County, West Virginia markets, expansion into Monongalia and Kanawha Counties, West Virginia and, most recently, into Fairfax County, Virginia.  With the acquisition of PMG, mortgage banking is now a much more significant focus, which has opened up increased market opportunities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region and added enough volume to further diversify the Company s revenue stream. 
  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the prior year-end audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s filing on Form 10-K and the unaudited financial statements, ratios, statistics, and discussions contained elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   362   full-time equivalent employees.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
  The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and follow general practices within the banking industry.  Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments.  Application of certain accounting policies inherently requires a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such, the probability of actual results being materially different from reported estimates is increased.  Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event.  Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility.  The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal forecasting techniques. 
  The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in management s discussion and analysis of operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. 
  The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of losses inherent in classifications of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience of peer banks, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change.  Non-homogeneous loans are specifically evaluated due to the increased risks inherent in those loans.  The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type in the consolidated balance sheet.  Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in MVB s 10-K describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the Allowance for Loan Losses section of Management s Discussion and Analysis in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Overview of the Statements of Income 
  Excluding discontinued operations, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company earned   $2.3 million   compared to   $1.5 million   million in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Net interest income increased by   $1.7 million  , noninterest income increased by   $4.1 million   and noninterest expenses increased by   $4.0 million  .  The increase in net interest income was driven mainly by the continued growth of the Company's balance sheet, with   $166.8 million   in average loan growth and despite an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of   $154.2 million   and an increase in interest expense of   $396 thousand  . The increase in average interest bearing liabilities generated the increase in interest expense of   $396 thousand  ;   $145 thousand   of the increase was related to an increase in certificates of deposit, which increased cost of funds by   17   basis points,   $257 thousand   of the increase was related to MMDA, which increased the cost of funds by   20   basis points, and   $157 thousand   of the increase was related to FHLB and other borrowings, which increased the cost of funds by   19   basis points. In addition, income tax expense increased from   $569 thousand   to   $1.1 million   which equated to an effective tax rate of   27.37%   and   32.87%  , respectively.

Loan loss provisions of $1.1 million and $636 thousand were made for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in loan loss provision is attributable primarily to quarterly adjustments to the qualitative factors that increased the loan loss allocation rates in effect during the   third   quarter of   2016  , an increased level of charge offs, and the recognition of additional loan impairments. The increased charge offs and loan impairments were mainly concentrated in just three commercial loans, one of which is a $1.1 million commercial real estate development loan, net of a $535 thousand charge off, that is contractually current as of   September 30, 2016  , and continues to pay in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. This loan is considered non-performing due to an extended period of interest only debt service requirements and the impairment of this loan has been increased to be an additional $509 thousand during the   third   quarter of   2016  , the result of an updated appraisal. The other two loans were related party commercial loans that were impacted by downturns in the coal industry and totaled $366 thousand, net of $679 thousand of partial charge-offs and $435 thousand of proceeds received from the orderly liquidation of the collateral. The provision for loan losses, which is a product of management s formal quarterly analysis, is recorded in response to inherent losses in the loan portfolio.  The Company charged off $1.0 million in loans during the   third   quarter of   2016   versus   $304 thousand   for the same time period in   2015  . As noted above, charge offs of $679 thousand, or 67% of the total   third   quarter   2016   charge offs, were attributable to the related party coal industry loans. Meanwhile, the remaining $339 thousand, or 33%, of   third   quarter   2016   charge offs were attributable to one additional $86 thousand commercial loan that was charged off in its entirety, and four consumer loans that incurred $253 thousand in partial charge offs. All of these loans, with the exception of those charged off completely, were non-performing as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Excluding discontinued operations, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company earned   $6.7 million   compared to   $5.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net interest income increased by   $7.2 million  , noninterest income increased by   $5.3 million   and noninterest expenses increased by   $9.2 million  . The increase in net interest income was driven mainly by the continued growth of the Company's balance sheet, with   $210.8 million   in average loan growth and despite an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of   $200.7 million   and an increase in interest expense of   $1.6 million  . The increase in average interest bearing liabilities generated the increase in interest expense of   $1.6 million  ;   $710 thousand   of the increase was related to an increase in certificates of deposit, which increased cost of funds by   15   basis points,   $559 thousand   of the increase was related to MMDA, which increased the cost of funds by   16   basis points, and   $368 thousand   of the increase was related to FHLB and other borrowings, which increased the cost of funds by   21   basis points. In addition, income tax expense increased from   $2.5 million   to   $3.3 million   which equated to an effective tax rate of   31.63%   and   32.86%  , respectively.  
  Loan loss provisions of $3.0 million and $1.9 million were made for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in loan loss provision is attributable primarily to quarterly adjustments to the qualitative factors that increased loan loss allocation rates in effect during the   third   quarter of   2016  , an increased level of charge offs, and the recognition of additional loan impairments. The increased charge offs and loan impairments were mainly concentrated in just three commercial loans, one of which is a $1.1 million commercial real estate development loan, net of a $535 thousand charge off, that is contractually current as of   September 30, 2016  , and continues to pay in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. This loan is considered non-performing due to an extended period of interest only debt service requirements. The other two loans were related party commercial loans that were impacted by downturns in the coal industry and  totaled $366 thousand, net of $679 thousand of partial charge-offs and $435 thousand of proceeds received  from the orderly liquidation of the collateral. The provision for loan losses, which is a product of management s formal quarterly analysis, is recorded in response to inherent losses in the loan portfolio.  The Company charged off   $1.8 million   in loans during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   $727 thousand   for the same time period in   2015  . As noted above, a charge off of $535 thousand, or 29% of the total   2016   charge offs, was attributable to the development loan while charge offs of $679 thousand, or 37%, were attributable to the related party coal industry loans. Meanwhile, the remaining $630 thousand of total   2016   charge offs were attributable to a variety of relatively smaller loans, including four commercial loans that incurred $232 thousand, or 13%, of the total 2016 charge offs, six consumer loans that incurred a total of $275 thousand, or 15%, or total   2016   charge offs, and two residential mortgage loans that incurred $124 thousand, or 7%, of the total 2016 charge offs. All of these loans, with the exception of those charged off completely, were non-performing as of   September 30, 2016  .

Interest Income and Expense 
  Net interest income is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans and investment securities. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits and repurchase agreements, subordinated debt and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Net interest income is a primary source of revenue for the bank. Changes in market interest rates, as well as changes in the mix and volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. This ratio serves as a performance measurement of the net interest revenue stream generated by the Company s balance sheet. 
  The net interest margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   3.17%   and   3.11%   respectively.  The   6   basis point increase in the net interest margin for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was the result of a   7   basis point increase in yield, largely the result of a   30   basis point increase in yield on consumer loans, a   17   basis point increase in yield on real estate loans, a   51   basis point increase in tax-exempt investment securities, and a   12   basis point increase on taxable investment securities. Cost of funds for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   versus   2015   increased by   1   basis point. The cost of funds increase was mainly the result of a   19   basis point increase in FHLB and other borrowings, a   17   basis point increase in certificates of deposit and a   20   basis point increase in money market checking and offset by a   12   basis point decrease in NOW and an   10   basis point decrease in savings. The continued low rate environment and increasing competition for quality credit continues to apply pressure upon the Company s loan portfolio yield. The Company was able to grow average loan balances by   $166.8 million   and average deposit balances by   $118.9 million  , resulting in an increase in net interest income of   $1.7 million  . Additionally, investment securities average balance increased by   $27.7 million   through the purchase of available-for-sale securities, and the resulting securities earned higher rates in the loan portfolio.  An increase in the Company s average non-interest bearing balances of   $21.8 million   helped to sustain a   10   basis point favorable spread on net interest margin. 
  The net interest margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   3.22%   and   3.02%   respectively.  The   20   basis point increase in the net interest margin for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was the result of a   21   basis point increase in yield, largely the result of a   18   basis point increase in yield on commercial loans, a   20   basis point increase in yield on real estate loans, and a   49   basis point increase in tax-exempt investment securities. The increase in yield on commercial loans was primarily the result of the recovery of non-accrual interest on one commercial lending relationship which contributed   $662 thousand   to commercial loan interest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , representing   12   basis points of the increase in commercial loan yield for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Cost of funds for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   2015   increased by   3   basis points. The cost of funds increase was mainly the result of a   21   basis point increase in FHLB and other borrowings, a   15   basis point increase in certificates of deposit and a   16   basis point increase in money market checking and offset by a   8   basis point decrease in NOW and a   8   basis point decrease in savings. The continued low rate environment and increasing competition for quality credit continues to apply pressure upon the Company s loan portfolio yield. The Company was able to grow average loan balances by   $210.8 million   and average deposit balances by   $187.8 million  , resulting in an increase in net interest income of   7.2 million  . Additionally, investment securities average balance increased by   17.1 million   through the purchase of available-for-sale securities, and the resulting securities earned higher rates in the loan portfolio.  An increase in the Company s average non-interest bearing balances of   19.3 million   helped to sustain a   10   basis point favorable spread on net interest margin. 
  Company and Bank management continuously monitor the effects of net interest margin on the performance of the Bank and, thus, the Company. Growth and mix of the balance sheet will continue to impact net interest margin in future periods.

Non-Interest Income 
  Mortgage fee income and gain on derivatives generate the core of the Company s noninterest income. Also, gain on sale of portfolio loans and interchange income continue to be part of the core of the Bank s noninterest income. In addition, beginning in the   third quarter of 2015  , the Bank began entering into swap loan agreements. These swap loan agreements allow the bank to offer customers fixed rate loans and the bank to  swap  the interest rate on the loans with a third party at a floating rate. This helps the Bank lower its exposure by improving the interest rate risk position and also produces current period non-interest income. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , noninterest income totaled   $12.5 million   compared to   $8.5 million   for the same time period in   2015  .  The   $4.0 million   increase in noninterest income was mainly the result of an increase in gain on derivatives of   $2.0 million   and a   $1.7 million   increase in mortgage fee income. The increase in gain on derivatives was largely the result of a   18%   increase in the locked mortgage loan pipeline for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . In addition, loans held for sale increased from   $73.0 million   at   September 30, 2015   to   $123.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The increase in mortgage fee income was due to a   $106.0 million   or   16%   increase in loan sale volume combined with a flat gain on sale margin. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , noninterest income totaled   $33.1 million   compared to   $27.9 million   for the same time period in   2015  .  The   $5.2 million   increase in noninterest income was mainly the result of a   $3.0 million   increase in mortgage fee income, a   $952 thousand   increase in gain on sale of securities and a   $1.4 million   increase in gain on derivatives. The increase in mortgage fee income was due to a   $143.5 million   or   13.8%   increase in loan sale volume combined with a flat gain on sale margin. The increase in gain on sale of securities was the result of selling   $42.3 million   more investment securities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus the same time period in   2015  . The increase in gain on derivatives was largely the result of an   13%   increase in the locked mortgage loan pipeline for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . In addition, loans held for sale increased from   $73.0 million   at   September 30, 2015   to   $123.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Non-Interest Expense 
  The Company had   362   full-time equivalent personnel at   September 30, 2016  , as noted, compared to   376   full-time equivalent personnel as of   September 30, 2015  .  Company and Bank management will continue to strive to find new ways of increasing efficiencies and leveraging its resources, while effectively optimizing customer service. 
  Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing and communications, mortgage processing and professional fees generate the core of the Company s noninterest expense. The Company s efficiency ratio was   80.58%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   84.46%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . This ratio measures the efficiency of noninterest expenses incurred in relationship to net interest income plus noninterest income.  The decreased efficiency ratio is the result of net interest income and noninterest income outpacing the growth in noninterest expense.  
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , noninterest expense totaled   $18.7 million   compared to   $14.8 million   for the same time period in   2015  . The   $3.9 million   increase in noninterest expense was mainly the result of the following: 
  Salaries and employee benefits expense increased   $3.1 million  , this increase related to: the addition of new bank and mortgage offices, increased incentives and commissions related to goal attainment and production, additional staffing related to organic growth and raises for existing staff. 
  Occupancy and equipment expense increased   $157 thousand  . This increase was mainly the result of the opening of multiple new bank and mortgage office locations. 
  Data processing and communication costs increased   $387 thousand  . This increase was largely driven by a $300 thousand core vendor termination fee that was accrued for in September 2016. In addition, overall growth in terms of client base, personnel and office space, and the usage of new and enhanced products, services and providers to better serve the client base also drove the increase. 
  Other operating expenses increased   $630 thousand  . The increase was offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of other real estate properties. 
  The Company s efficiency ratio was   80.23%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   81.69%   for the same period in   2015  . This ratio measures the efficiency of noninterest expenses incurred in relationship to net interest income plus noninterest income.  The decreased efficiency ratio is the result of net interest income and noninterest income outpacing the growth in noninterest expense.

For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , noninterest expense totaled   $52.4 million   compared to   $43.2 million   for the same time period in   2015  . The   $9.2 million   increase in noninterest expense was mainly the result of the following: 
  Salaries and employee benefits expense increased   $7.0 million  , this increase related to: the addition of new bank and mortgage offices, increased incentives and commissions related to goal attainment and production, additional staffing related to organic growth and raises for existing staff. 
  Occupancy and equipment expense increased   $581 thousand  . This increase was mainly the result of the opening of multiple new bank and mortgage office locations. 
  Data processing and communication costs increased   $949 thousand  . This increase was largely driven by a $300 thousand core vendor termination fee that was accrued for in September 2016. In addition, overall growth in terms of client base, personnel and office space, and the usage of new and enhanced products, services and providers to better serve the client base also drove the increase. 
  Other operating expenses increased   $503 thousand  . The increase was primarily the result of a decrease in gains on the sale of other real estate properties. 
  Return on Average Assets and Average Equity (Annualized) 
  Excluding discontinued operations, returns on average assets (ROA) and average equity (ROE) annualized were   0.64%   and   7.32%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   0.48%   and   5.35%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   0.16%   increase in ROA is due to increased earnings from continuing operations of   $800 thousand   and slightly offset by a   $195.8 million   increase in average assets for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . The increase in average assets was primarily due to an increase in net loans due to continued loan growth. The   1.97%   increase in ROE is also due to increased earnings of   $800 thousand   and a   $13.5 million   increase in average equity for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in average equity was mainly due to increased earnings. 
  Excluding discontinued operations, returns on average assets (ROA) and average equity (ROE) annualized were   0.62%   and   7.41%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   0.60%   and   6.41%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The   0.02%   increase in ROA is due to increased earnings from continuing operations of   $1.3 million   but was nearly outpaced by a   $232.5 million   increase in average assets for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in average assets was primarily due to an increase in net loans due to continued loan growth. The   1.00%   increase in ROE is also due to increased earnings of   $1.3 million   and a   $8.7 million   increase in average equity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in average equity was mainly due to increased earnings. 
  Overview of the Statement of Condition 
  The Company s interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, and stockholders  equity changed significantly during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  . The most significant areas of change between the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   were as follows: total loans increased to an average balance of   $1.2 billion   from   $1.0 billion  , investment securities increased   $27.7 million   to an average of   $146.0 million  , interest-bearing liabilities grew to an average balance of   $1.2 billion   from   $1.0 billion   and stockholders  equity grew   $13.5 million   to an average of   $126.3 million  .  These trends reflect the continued growth of the Company and its subsidiary in the loan, deposit and capital areas. 
  Total assets at   September 30, 2016   were   $1.5 billion   or an increase of   $84.1 million   since   December 31, 2015  .  The greatest area of increase was a   $42.8 million   increase in net loan growth. 
  Deposits totaled   $1.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   or an increase of   $114.5 million   since   December 31, 2015  , mainly the result of an increase in savings, NOW and time deposits. 
  Stockholders  equity has increased approximately   $10.7 million   from   December 31, 2015   largely due to earnings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $10.6 million  . In addition, unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities increased   $1.3 million  , in part due to the reclassification of all held-to-maturity investments into available-for-sale investments. Also, pension liability was reduced by   $430 thousand  .

  Cash and cash equivalents totaled   $28.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $29.1 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  Total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate on a daily basis due to transactions in process and other liquidity and performance demands.  Management believes the liquidity needs of the Company are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional and non-traditional funding sources, and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year.  These sources of funds should enable the Company and the Bank to meet cash obligations as they come due.  
  Investment Securities 
  Prior to the final determination of Basel III, investments were recorded as held-to-maturity due to the uncertainty of the capital treatment of available-for-sale investments. Upon the issuance of the final ruling, the Company opted out of the Other Comprehensive Income treatment of available-for-sale investments permitted under Basel III. Due to the change in capital treatment under the final ruling of Basel III, the Company s purpose of recording investments as held-to-maturity changed; therefore, during the period ended   March 31, 2016  , the Company reclassified   $52.4 million   of the remaining held-to-maturity investments into available-for-sale investments. 
  Investment securities totaled   $152.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $123.1 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the investment portfolio is comprised of the following mix of securities: 
               
    36.6%   - U.S. Sponsored Mortgage-backed securities 
                
    4.7%   - Equity and other securities 
     The Company and Bank management monitor the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through Asset/Liability Committee meetings. The group also monitors net interest income and pricing guidelines, and manages interest rate risk for the bank. Through active balance sheet management and analysis of the investment securities portfolio, the bank maintains sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor requirements and the various credit needs of its customers. The Company and Bank management believes the risk characteristics inherent in the investment portfolio are acceptable based on these parameters.  
  Loans 
  The Company s loan portfolio totaled   $1.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $1.0 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  . The Bank s lending is primarily focused in the Marion, Harrison, Jefferson, Berkeley, Monongalia, and Kanawha counties of West Virginia, as well as the northern Virginia area for the mortgage and commercial lending business. Its extended market is in the adjacent counties. The portfolio consists principally of commercial lending, retail lending, which includes single-family residential mortgages, and consumer lending. The growth in loans is primarily attributable to organic growth within the Bank s primary lending areas and northern Virginia. 
  Loan Concentration 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $750.0 million  , or   69.7%   and   $729.3 million  , or   70.7%  , respectively, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans. A significant portion of the nonresidential real estate loan portfolio is secured by commercial real estate.  The majority of nonresidential real estate loans that are not secured by real estate are lines of credit secured by accounts receivable and equipment and obligations of states and political subdivisions. While the loan concentration is in nonresidential real estate loans, the nonresidential real estate portfolio is comprised of loans to many different borrowers, in numerous different industries but primarily located in our market areas.

Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The allowance for loan losses was   $9.2 million   or    0.85%   of total loans at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $8.0 million   or   0.78%   of total loans at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in this ratio was the direct result of the increase in loan loss provision noted previously in the Overview of the Statements of Income   on page 44  . An increase of the overall loan loss allocation rates caused by adjustments to the qualitative factors, an increased level of charge offs, and the recognition of additional loan impairments each attributed to the increased loan loss provision. Furthermore, this increased level of loan loss provision occurred in conjunction with a period of relatively lower loan growth, thus creating an increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans. The Bank management continually monitors the risk in the loan portfolio through review of the monthly delinquency reports and the Loan Review Committee.  The Loan Review Committee is responsible for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. This analysis involves both experience of the portfolio to date and the makeup of the overall portfolio.  Specific loss estimates are derived for individual loans based on specific criteria such as current delinquent status, related deposit account activity, where applicable, and changes in the local and national economy.  When appropriate, Management also considers public knowledge and/or verifiable information from the local market to assess risks to specific loans and the loan portfolios as a whole. 
  Capital Resources 
  The Company considers a number of alternatives, including but not limited to deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings when evaluating funding sources. Traditional deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for the bank, reaching   $1.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Non-interest bearing deposits remain a core funding source for the Bank and, thus, the Company.  At   September 30, 2016  , non-interest bearing deposits totaled   $105.8 million   compared to   $80.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The Company and Bank management intend to continue to focus on finding ways to increase the base of non-interest bearing funding sources of the Bank and its subsidiaries. 
  Interest-bearing deposits totaled   $1.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $931.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Average interest-bearing liabilities totaled   $1.2 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $997.0 million   for the same time period in   2015  .  This   $200.7 million   increase is the result of the following:   $44.9 million   increase in CDs,   $26.9 million   increase in NOW accounts,   $85.5 million   increase in MMDA and   $32.0 million   increase in FHLB and other borrowings. Average non-interest bearing demand deposits totaled   $96.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $77.3 million   for the same time period in   2015  .  Management will continue to emphasize deposit gathering in   2016   by offering outstanding customer service and competitively priced products.  The Company and Bank management will also concentrate on balancing deposit growth with adequate net interest margin to meet the Company s strategic goals. 
  Along with traditional deposits, the Bank has access to both repurchase agreements, which are corporate deposits secured by pledging securities from the investment portfolio, and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings to fund its operations and investments.  At   September 30, 2016  , repurchase agreements totaled   $27.2 million   compared to   $27.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  In addition to the aforementioned funds alternatives, the Bank has access to more than   $291.5 million   through additional advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and the ability to readily sell jumbo certificates of deposits to other banks as well as brokered deposit markets. 
  Liquidity 
  Maintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity is a primary objective of the Asset and Liability Committee ( ALCO ). Liquidity, as defined by the ALCO, is the ability to meet anticipated operating cash needs, loan demand, and deposit withdrawals, without incurring a sustained negative impact on net interest income. It is MVB s policy to manage liquidity so that there is no need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions. 
  The main source of liquidity for the Bank comes through deposit growth. Liquidity is also provided from cash generated from investment maturities, principal payments from loans, and income from loans and investment securities. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash provided by financing activities totaled   $65.9 million  , while outflows from investing activity totaled   $57.7 million  . When appropriate, the Bank has the ability to take advantage of external sources of funds such as advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), national market certificate of deposit issuance programs, the Federal Reserve discount window, brokered deposits and CDARS. These external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that enable the Bank to match funding with contractual maturity dates of assets. Securities in the investment portfolio are primarily classified as available-for-sale and can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity.

The Company has an effective shelf registration covering   $75 million   of debt and equity securities, all of which remains available, subject to Board authorization and market conditions, to issue equity or debt securities at our discretion. While we seek to preserve flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit us to sell securities on acceptable terms at any given time or at all. 
  Current Economic Conditions 
  The Company s primary market areas are the Marion, Harrison, Jefferson, Berkeley, Monongalia, and Kanawha counties of West Virginia and Fairfax county of Virginia. In addition, MVB Mortgage has mortgage only offices located in Virginia, Washington, DC, as well as North Carolina and South Carolina and, in addition, has mortgage loan originators located at select Bank locations throughout West Virginia. 
  The current economic climate in the Company s primary market areas reflect economic climates that are generally more favorable than the general national climate. Unemployment in the United States was   4.8%   and   4.9%   in   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The unemployment levels in the Company s primary market areas were as follows for the periods indicated: 

Nonperforming loans to total loans were   0.95%   as of   September 30, 2016   versus   0.94%   as of   September 30, 2015  . Charge offs to total loans were   0.17%   and   0.07%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company and the Bank continue to closely monitor economic and delinquency trends. 
  The Company originates various types of loans, including commercial and commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, home equity lines of credit, real estate construction loans, and consumer loans (loans to individuals). In general, the Company retains most of its originated loans (exclusive of certain long-term, fixed rate residential mortgages that are sold.)  However, loans originated in excess of the Bank s legal lending limit are participated to other banking institutions and the servicing of those loans is retained by the bank. 
  The energy industry, consisting of coal and natural gas, which has been negatively impacted by the decline in energy commodity prices, are elements of the West Virginia economy and numerous markets in which the Company operates. The Company has limited exposure in both the coal and natural gas industry.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the outstanding loan balances to coal and natural gas production clients was   $7.2 million   and   $7.3 million  , respectively. 

Capital/Stockholders  Equity    
  The Company and the Bank have financed operations and growth over the years through the sale of equity.  These equity sales have resulted in an effective source of capital. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled   $2.0 million   compared to   $2.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . This change is primarily the result in the rise of the change in the value of the unrealized loss on available for sale securities in large part due to the reclassification of all held-to-maturity investments into available-for-sale investments. 
  Treasury stock shares totaled   51,077   shares. 
  The Board of Directors of the Company approved a transition from a semi-annual dividend to a quarterly dividend on   August 18, 2015   and declared its first quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of record at the close of business on   September 1, 2015  , payable   September 15, 2015  . 
  The primary source of funds for dividends to be paid by the Company are dividends received by the Company from the Bank. Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to restrictions by banking regulations. The most restrictive provision requires regulatory  

51 

     Table of Contents  

approval if dividends declared in any year exceed that year s retained net profits, as defined, plus the retained net profits, as defined, of the two preceding years. 
  Capital Requirements 
  The Bank s total risk based capital ratio increased from   12.19%   at   December 31, 2015   to   12.30%   at   September 30, 2016  . The increase in this ratio was largely due to a   $13.4 million   increase in total bank capital.   
  The Company and the Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, respectively ( Capital Rules ).  State chartered banks, such as the Bank, are subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions. 
  The Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called  Common Equity Tier 1  ( CET1 ), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and  Additional Tier 1 capital  instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. 
  Under the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios effective as of   January 1, 2015   are: 
              
    6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 
                
    8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 
                
    4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the  leverage ratio ). 
     The Capital Rules also introduced a new  capital conservation buffer , composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on   January 1, 2016   at the 0.625% level and will increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on   January 1, 2019  . The Capital Rules also provide for a  countercyclical capital buffer  that is only applicable to certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to the Company or the Bank. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and effectively increases the minimum required risk-weighted capital ratios. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets below the effective minimum (4.5% plus the capital conservation buffer and, if applicable, the countercyclical capital buffer) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 
  When fully phased in on   January 1, 2019  , the Capital Rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%; and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. The Capital Rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. 
  The Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the general risk-based capital rules to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. 
  With respect to the Bank, the Capital Rules also revise the  prompt corrective action  regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as discussed below under  Prompt Corrective Action.  
  Prompt Corrective Action 
  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA") requires among other things, the federal banking agencies to take  prompt corrective action  in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers:  well capitalized,   adequately capitalized,   undercapitalized,   significantly undercapitalized  and  critically undercapitalized.  A depository institution s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures, which reflect changes under the Capital Rules that became effective on   January 1, 2015  , are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio. 

52 

     Table of Contents  

A bank will be (i)  well capitalized  if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii)  adequately capitalized  if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not  well capitalized  (iii)  undercapitalized  if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv)  significantly undercapitalized  if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v)  critically undercapitalized  if the institution s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 
  The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be  undercapitalized.   Undercapitalized  institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is  significantly undercapitalized.  
   Significantly undercapitalized  depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become  adequately capitalized,  requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.  Critically undercapitalized  institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 
  The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. 
  The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution. 
  In addition to the  prompt corrective action  directives, failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 
  For further information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of the Company and the Bank see the discussion under the section captioned  Capital/Stockholders  Equity  included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 14,  Regulatory Capital Requirements  of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the Company s   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the statements of financial condition. 
  The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.  The  

53 

     Table of Contents  

Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. 
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.  The amount and type of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, varies and is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.  The Company s policy for obtaining collateral, and the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as that involved in making commitments to extend credit. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  The Company grants a majority of its commercial, financial, agricultural, real estate and installment loans to customers throughout the Marion, Harrison, Monongalia, Kanawha, Jefferson and Berkeley County areas of West Virginia as well as the Northern Virginia area and adjacent counties.  Collateral for loans is primarily residential and commercial real estate, personal property, and business equipment.  The Company evaluates the credit worthiness of each of its customers on a case-by-case basis, and the amount of collateral it obtains is based upon management s credit evaluation. 
  Regulatory 
  The Company is required to maintain certain reserve balances on hand in accordance with the Federal Reserve Board requirements. The average balance maintained in accordance with such requirements was   $12.2 million   and   $17.0 million   on   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. On October 4, 2016, the Company began utilizing a software platform to aid in minimizing the daily reserve requirement with the Federal Reserve Board. 
  Contingent Liability 
  The subsidiary bank is involved in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management and counsel, the outcome of these matters will not have a significant adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Commitments 
  The Bank has entered into certain agreements that represent off-balance sheet arrangements that could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements and could have a significant impact in future periods. Specifically, the Bank has entered into agreements to extend credit or provide conditional payments pursuant to standby and commercial letters of credit. 
  Commitments to extend credit, including loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. 
  Market Risk 
  There have been no material changes in market risks faced by the Company since   December 31, 2015  .  For information regarding the Company s market risk, refer to the Company s Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Effects of Inflation on Financial Statements 
  Substantially all of the Bank s assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature. Therefore, they are not impacted by inflation to the same degree as companies in capital-intensive industries in a replacement cost environment. During a period of rising prices, a net monetary asset position results in loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power. In the banking industry, typically monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities. Therefore as prices increase, financial institutions experience a decline in the purchasing power of their net assets.

Future Outlook 
  The Company s net income from continuing operations increased in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   mainly due to an increase in net interest income, an increase in gain on derivatives, an increase in mortgage fee income and offset partially by an increase in noninterest expense. The Company has invested in the infrastructure to support envisioned future growth in each key area, including personnel, technology and processes to meet the growing compliance requirements in the industry. Commercial and retail loan production remains strong and mortgage has added staff and locations to ramp up production and improve profitability. The Company believes it is well positioned in some of the finest markets in the states of West Virginia and Virginia and will focus on doing the things that have made it successful thus far through the following: margin improvement; leveraging capital; organic portfolio loan growth; and operating efficiency. The critical challenge for the Company in the future is to attract core deposits to fund growth in the new markets through continued delivery of the most outstanding customer service with the highest quality products and technology. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  The Company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk. The ALCO is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishes policies to monitor and coordinate the Company s sources, uses, and pricing of funds. 
  Interest Rate Sensitivity Management 
  The Company uses a simulation model to analyze, manage and formulate operating strategies that address net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates. The simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a twenty-four month period. The model is based on the actual maturity and re-pricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumption of certain assets and liabilities as of   June 30, 2016  . The model assumes changes in interest rates without any management intervention to change the composition of the balance sheet. According to the model run for the period ended   June 30, 2016  , over a twelve month period an immediate   100   basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by   3.22%  . An immediate   200   basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by   5.95%  . A   100   basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in net interest income of   5.92%  .  While management carefully monitors the exposure to changes in interest rates and takes actions as warranted to decrease any adverse impact, there can be no assurance about the actual effect of interest rate changes on net interest income. 
  The Company s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its ALCO. The ALCO meets quarterly and has responsibility for formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and reviewing interest rate sensitivity. 
  We have counter-party risk which may arise from the possible inability of the Company s third-party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts. The Company works with third-party investors that are generally well-capitalized, are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk. We do not expect any third-party investor to fail to meet its obligation. We monitor the financial condition of these third parties on an annual basis. We do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer, along with the Company s Chief Financial Officer (the Principal Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness as of   September 30, 2016  , of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, along with the Company s Principal Accounting Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  There have been no material changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the   third   quarter of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiary are subject to claims, asserted or unasserted, or named as a party to lawsuits or investigations.  Litigation, in general, and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations.  Moreover, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with any certainty and in the case of more complex legal proceedings, the results are difficult to predict at all.  The Company is not aware of any asserted or unasserted legal proceedings or claims that the Company believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of the Company s operations.

-3-   shall pay to Seller an amount (the  Earn-Out Payment ) equal to the sum of (i) 0.363   multiplied by the average of the aggregate Net Commissions and Fees for the Annual Periods of   the Measurement Period (such product referred to herein as the  Earn-Out Calculation   Amount ), plus (ii) $400,000, which Earn-Out Calculation Amount shall be determined as set   forth in Section 2.3 below and consistent with the methodology set forth in Schedule 2.1(b), and   which Earn-Out Payment shall be paid as set forth in Section 2.3 below.

Upon Purchaser s request, Seller agrees to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to   cooperate with Purchaser in promptly assigning the Non-Accepting Producer Agreement to   Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything in this provision to the contrary, if the Non-Accepting   Purchaser Agreement is assigned to Purchaser, Purchaser may elect to enforce or waive the terms   of the Non-Accepting Producer Agreement in its sole discretion, and in no event will Seller be   entitled to participate in, direct or control the course of any litigation or settlement that may arise   in connection with the enforcement of the restrictive covenants set forth therein.   The payments contemplated by this Section 2.1(c) shall be payable on or before the date   that is fifteen (15) days after the date on which the Final Specified Account Net Commissions   and Fees has been determined in accordance with Section 2.4. Such payments shall be made in   compliance with Section 2.4 and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds   to an account designated by Seller. In no event shall the Additional Payment (if any) exceed the   Non-Accepting Producer Amount.   2.2 Post-Closing Adjustment.   (a) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall have agreed on an estimate of the   Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time on the Closing Date (the  Preliminary Net   Working Capital ), which Preliminary Net Working Capital is set forth as Schedule 2.2(a)   hereto and reflects each of the components to be included in the Net Working Capital calculation   as agreed to by the Parties. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Closing   Consideration has been decreased by an amount equal to the Preliminary Net Working Capital.   (b) Within 60 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to   Seller a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of Net Working Capital as of   the Effective Time on the Closing Date (the  Closing Net Working Capital ). The Closing Net   Working Capital shall be prepared in accordance with the methodology set forth in Schedule     

-4-   2.2(a). If within 30 days after the delivery of the Closing Net Working Capital to Seller,   Purchaser and Seller agree upon the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital calculation,   then such calculation shall be deemed final and binding and the Closing Consideration shall be   adjusted if at all, in accordance with Section 2.2(g); however, if the Parties do not so agree on   such calculation, then Section 2.2(c) and Section 2.2(d) hereof shall apply.   (c) If Seller in good faith disagrees with any portion of the Closing Net Working   Capital calculation, Seller may, within 30 days after receipt of such statement (the  Objection   Period ), deliver a written notice to Purchaser setting forth Seller s objections thereto (the    Objection Notice ). Any Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail those items or   amounts as to which Seller disagrees and the basis for such disagreement and, if the   disagreement relates to the calculation of amounts, Seller s calculation of such amounts. If an   Objection Notice is not timely received by Purchaser within the Objection Period, Seller shall be   deemed to agree in all respects with the Closing Net Working Capital as prepared by Purchaser,   and such calculation shall be final and binding on the Parties and the Closing Consideration shall   be adjusted, if at all, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2(g).   (d) If an Objection Notice is timely received by Purchaser within the Objection   Period, the Parties shall, during the 30 days following Purchaser s receipt of such notice, use   their good faith, reasonable efforts to reach an agreement on the disputed terms. If such an   agreement is reached, the Closing Net Working Capital as so agreed shall be final and binding on   the Parties and the Closing Consideration shall be adjusted, if at all, in accordance with the   provisions of Section 2.2(g). If the Parties are unable to reach such an agreement, Purchaser and   Seller shall jointly retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if the Parties agree, another mutually   acceptable independent accounting firm (the  Accountant ) to resolve any remaining   disagreements. Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall execute, if requested by the Accountant, a   reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnification provisions in favor of the   Accountant. Purchaser and Seller shall direct the Accountant to render a determination in   writing as promptly as practicable and in any event within 30 days after its retention and the   Parties shall cooperate with the Accountant during its engagement and make available the   records and workpapers necessary for its review. The Accountant shall consider only those   items and amounts set forth in the Objection Notice that Purchaser and Seller have been unable   to resolve, and the Accountant shall review only the records and workpapers submitted and base   its determination solely on such submissions and the related computational materials. In   resolving any disputed item, the Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the   greatest value of such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item   claimed by either Party. The Accountant s determination shall be based on the definitions   included herein and shall otherwise be made in accordance with this Agreement. The   determination of the Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and the   Closing Consideration shall be adjusted, if at all, in accordance with the provisions of Section   2.2(g).   (e) The Closing Net Working Capital (either as agreed to by Seller and Purchaser, as   deemed final pursuant to either Section 2.2(b) or (c) above or as adjusted pursuant to Section   2.2(d) above) shall be final and binding on the Parties and will be referred to as the  Final Net   Working Capital.  Purchaser and Seller shall each bear a percentage of the fees and expenses     

-5-   of the Accountant in the inverse proportion to which the Accountant determines such Party is   correct in its calculation of the disputed items as set forth in the Objection Notice. For example,   if the Accountant determines that Purchaser is 75% correct in its calculation of the aggregate   disputed items, Seller shall bear 75% of the Accountant s fees and expenses.   (f) Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall cooperate and assist in good faith in the   preparation of the Closing Net Working Capital and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in   this Section 2.2, including making available, to the extent reasonably necessary, books, records,   work papers and personnel at such reasonable times as any party shall request and permitting (at   the expense of the requesting party) the copying of any records or extracts thereof reasonably   requested.   (g) If Final Net Working Capital is less than Preliminary Net Working Capital, Seller   shall, or the Holding Corporation shall cause Seller to, promptly pay the amount of such shortfall   to Purchaser. If Final Net Working Capital is greater than Preliminary Net Working Capital,   Purchaser shall promptly pay the amount of such excess to Seller. Such payment, if any, shall be   made within 5 business days after the Final Net Working Capital is determined and shall be   payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by   the Party receiving payment.   2.3 Earn-Out Payment.   (a) Commencing with the calendar quarter ending September 30, 2016 and   continuing for each calendar quarter thereafter through the end of the Measurement Period,   Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of such period, deliver to Seller   its production report in substantially the same form that it provides to its producers, setting forth   the aggregate Net Commissions and Fees for such period.   (b) Within 30 days after the end of the Measurement Period, Purchaser shall prepare   and deliver to Seller a statement setting forth the Earn-Out Calculation Amount as determined by   Purchaser in good faith in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and this Section 2.3 and consistent   with the methodology set forth in Schedule 2.1(b) (the  Estimated Earn-Out Calculation   Amount ).   (c) If Seller in good faith disagrees with Purchaser s Estimated Earn-Out Calculation   Amount, Seller may, within 30 days after receipt of such statement (the  Earn-Out Payment   Objection Period ), deliver to Purchaser a notice disagreeing therewith and setting forth Seller s   objections (the  Earn-Out Payment Objection Notice ). The Earn-Out Payment Objection   Notice shall specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which Seller disagrees, the   basis of such disagreement and, if the disagreement relates to the calculation of amounts, Seller s   calculation of such amounts. If the Earn-Out Payment Objection Notice is not timely received   by Purchaser within the Earn-Out Payment Objection Period, Seller shall be deemed to agree in   all respects with the applicable Estimated Earn-Out Calculation Amount as prepared by   Purchaser, and such calculation shall be final and binding on the Parties.     

-6-   (d) If an Earn-Out Payment Objection Notice is timely received by Purchaser within   the Earn-Out Payment Objection Period, the Parties shall, during the 20 days following   Purchaser s receipt of such notice, use their good faith, reasonable efforts to reach an agreement   on the disputed items. If such an agreement is reached, the Estimated Earn-Out Calculation   Amount as so agreed shall be final and binding on the Parties. If the Parties are unable to reach   such an agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly retain the Accountant to resolve any   remaining disagreements. Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall execute, if requested by the   Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnification provisions in   favor of the Accountant. Purchaser and Seller shall direct the Accountant to render a   determination in writing as promptly as practicable and in any event within 30 days after its   retention and the Parties shall cooperate with the Accountant during its engagement and make   available the records and workpapers necessary for its review. The Accountant shall consider   only those items and amounts set forth in the Earn-Out Payment Objection Notice that Purchaser   and Seller have been unable to resolve, and the Accountant shall review only the records and   workpapers submitted and base its determination solely on such submissions and the related   computational materials. In resolving any disputed item, the Accountant may not assign a value   to any item greater than the greatest value of such item claimed by either party or less than the   smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Accountant s determination shall be   based on the definitions included herein and shall otherwise be made in accordance with this   Agreement. The determination of the Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon the   Parties. Purchaser and Seller shall each bear a percentage of the fees and expenses of the   Accountant in the inverse proportion to which the Accountant determines such Party is correct in   its calculation of Estimated Earn-Out Calculation Amount. For example, if the Accountant   determines that Purchaser is 75% correct in its calculation of Estimated Earn-Out Calculation   Amount, Seller shall bear 75% of the Account s fees and expenses. Purchaser and Seller shall   each bear 100% of their own related expenses.   (e) The Estimated Earn-Out Calculation Amount (either as agreed to by Seller and   Purchaser, as deemed final pursuant to Section 2.3(c) above or as adjusted pursuant to Section   2.3(d) above) shall be final and binding on the Parties and will be referred to as the  Final Earn-   Out Calculation Amount  for the Measurement Period.   (f) Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall cooperate and assist in good faith in the   preparation of the Estimated Earn-Out Calculation Amount and in the conduct of the reviews   referred to in this Section 2.3, including making available, to the extent reasonably necessary,   books, records, work papers and personnel at such reasonable times as any party shall request   and permitting (at the expense of the requesting party) the copying of any records or extracts   thereof reasonably requested.   (g) Purchaser shall pay Seller (i) one-half (1/2) of the Earn-Out Payment on or before   the date that is 45 days after the end of the Measurement Period (or, if the Final Earn-Out   Calculation Amount is not finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.3 until after such   date, within 5 days after such final determination), and (ii) one-half of the Earn-Out Payment on   or before the one year anniversary of the date that is 45 days after the end of the Measurement   Period. Such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an   account or accounts designated by Seller in writing to Purchaser.     

-7-   (h) The Parties agree that after the Closing Date, Purchaser may operate the Seller   Business in its sole discretion; provided that it will not take any action for the purpose of   reducing, or avoiding any increase in, the Earn-Out Payment.   2.4 Additional Payment.   (a) Within 30 days after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall   prepare and deliver to Seller a statement setting forth Purchaser s calculation of the Specified   Account Net Commissions and Fees for which Purchaser has received a broker of record letter   that is in full force and effect from the applicable Specified Accounts as of the second   anniversary of the Closing Date (the  Estimated Specified Account Net Commissions and   Fees ).   (b) If Seller in good faith disagrees with Purchaser s Estimated Specified Account   Net Commissions and Fees, Seller may, within 30 days after receipt of such statement (the    Additional Payment Objection Period ), deliver to Purchaser a notice disagreeing therewith   and setting forth Seller s objections (the  Additional Payment Objection Notice ). The   Additional Payment Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts   as to which Seller disagrees, the basis of such disagreement and, if the disagreement relates to   the calculation of amounts, Seller s calculation of such amounts. If the Additional Payment   Objection Notice is not timely received by Purchaser within the Additional Payment Objection   Period, Seller shall be deemed to agree in all respects with the applicable Estimated Specified   Account Net Commissions and Fees as prepared by Purchaser, and such calculation shall be final   and binding on the Parties.   (c) If an Additional Payment Objection Notice is timely received by Purchaser within   the Additional Payment Objection Period, the Parties shall, during the 20 days following   Purchaser s receipt of such notice, use their good faith, reasonable efforts to reach an agreement   on the disputed items. If such an agreement is reached, the Estimated Specified Account Net   Commissions and Fees as so agreed shall be final and binding on the Parties. If the Parties are   unable to reach such an agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly retain the Accountant to   resolve any remaining disagreements. Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall execute, if requested   by the Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnification   provisions in favor of the Accountant. Purchaser and Seller shall direct the Accountant to render   a determination in writing as promptly as practicable and in any event within 30 days after its   retention and the Parties shall cooperate with the Accountant during its engagement and make   available the records and workpapers necessary for its review. The Accountant shall consider   only those items and amounts set forth in the Additional Payment Objection Notice that   Purchaser and Seller have been unable to resolve, and the Accountant shall review only the   records and workpapers submitted and base its determination solely on such submissions and the   related computational materials. In resolving any disputed item, the Accountant may not assign   a value to any item greater than the greatest value of such item claimed by either party or less   than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Accountant s determination   shall be based on the definitions included herein and shall otherwise be made in accordance with   this Agreement. The determination of the Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon the     

-8-   Parties. Purchaser and Seller shall each bear a percentage of the fees and expenses of the   Accountant in the inverse proportion to which the Accountant determines such Party is correct in   its calculation of the Estimated Specified Account Net Commissions and Fees. For example, if   the Accountant determines that Purchaser is 75% correct in its calculation of Estimated Specified   Account Net Commissions and Fees, Seller shall bear 75% of the Account s fees and expenses.   Purchaser and Seller shall each bear 100% of their own related expenses.   (d) The Estimated Specified Account Net Commissions and Fees with respect to the   Specified Accounts from which Purchaser has received a broker of record letter that is in full   force and effect from the applicable Specified Accounts as of the second anniversary of the   Closing Date (either as agreed to by Seller and Purchaser, as deemed final pursuant to Section   2.4(b) above or as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4(c) above) shall be final and binding on the   Parties and will be referred to as the  Final Specified Account Net Commissions and Fees    with respect to the Specified Accounts as of the second anniversary of the Closing Date.   (e) Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall cooperate and assist in good faith in the   preparation of the Estimated Specified Account Net Commissions and Fees and in the conduct of   the reviews referred to in this Section 2.4, including making available, to the extent reasonably   necessary, books, records, work papers and personnel at such reasonable times as any party shall   request and permitting (at the expense of the requesting party) the copying of any records or   extracts thereof reasonably requested.   2.5 Acknowledgment of Restrictive Covenants. Each of the Seller Parties hereby agrees to   abide by his or its respective Restrictive Covenants and acknowledges and agrees that the payment   of the Closing Consideration shall constitute, among other things, full consideration for his and its   respective Restrictive Covenants, and the associated Goodwill included in the Acquired Assets.   2.6 Tax Allocation. The Parties shall allocate five percent of the Purchase Price to the   Restrictive Covenants and the remainder of the Purchase Price to the Acquired Assets for tax   purposes. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the tax allocation, if any, of Purchase Price to   Restrictive Covenants shall not, in any way, limit any remedy available to Purchaser for any   breach by any Seller Party of any Restrictive Covenants. The Earn-Out Payment, if any, will be   treated in accordance with Section 483 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, and   corresponding Treasury Regulations thereunder.   ARTICLE 3.

Notwithstanding the   preceding sentence, any representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity may be sought   under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to     

-21-   the preceding sentence if written notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such   right of indemnity has been given to the party against whom such indemnification may be sought   prior to such time.   (b) Any covenant or agreement of any party hereto that is to be performed after the   Closing Date shall survive the Closing indefinitely or, if sooner, for the time period provided in   this Agreement with respect to such covenant or agreement.   6.2 Indemnification by Purchaser.

Subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in   this Article 6, the Seller Parties shall defend, indemnify and hold Purchaser and the other USI   Companies and their respective directors, officers, shareholders, members and employees (the    Purchaser Indemnitees ) harmless from any Adverse Consequences resulting from or   otherwise arising out of (a)(i) any inaccurate representation or warranty made by the Seller   Parties, or either of them, in this Agreement, (ii) any breach or default in the performance of any   of the covenants or agreements made by the Seller Parties, or either of them, in this Agreement,   and (iii) any claim, action or cause of action or other liability arising out of or resulting from or   relating to the Excluded Liabilities, (b) Seller s ownership and operation of the Seller Business   and/or Acquired Assets on or prior to the Closing Date, and/or (c) Seller s ownership and   operation of its title insurance business prior to, on or after the Closing Date.   6.4 Indemnification Matters.   (a) The representations and warranties of the Seller Parties contained in Article 4, and   the covenants of the Seller Parties contained herein, are joint and several obligations.   Accordingly, each Seller Party will be responsible, to the extent provided hereunder and without   duplication, for the entirety of any Adverse Consequences suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee   thereof as a result of a breach by any Seller Party of any such representation and warranty.   (b) Without limiting any statutory, equitable or common law remedy that Purchaser   may have for a breach of this Agreement by any Seller Party, Purchaser shall have the right, but   shall not be required to, satisfy any claim for indemnification (as finally determined in   accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Article 6) for any   Adverse Consequences resulting from, arising out of or otherwise relating to such breach by,   upon notice to Seller, setting off against the amount of the Earn-Out Payment, if any, payable to   Seller, on a dollar-for-dollar basis the amount of any Adverse Consequences sustained by any   Purchaser Indemnitee.     

-22-   (c) The Seller Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that monetary damages will   not be an adequate remedy for a breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants, and that irreparable   injury will result to Purchaser and/or the other USI Companies and their respective successors in   interest in the event of any such breach. Accordingly, the Seller Parties agree that Purchaser or   such other USI Company (as applicable) shall be entitled to equitable relief in any court of   competent jurisdiction, including, without limitation, a temporary or permanent injunction,   restraining and enjoining such Party, or any Person with which such Party is associated or by   which such Party is employed, from further violations of such provisions, without the posting of   any security in connection therewith.   (d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,   (i) with respect solely to breaches of the representations and warranties   contained in Article 3 or Article 4 (excluding the Fundamental Representations) as provided for   pursuant to Sections 6.2(a) and 6.3(a)(i), the aggregate liability of either Purchaser or the Seller   Parties, absent fraud, for indemnification pursuant to Sections 6.2(a) or 6.3(a)(i) (as applicable)   hereof, shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the Closing Consideration. For the avoidance   of doubt, the limitation contained in this Section 6.4(d) will not apply to claims for   indemnification under Sections 6.2(b), 6.2(c) or 6.2(d) or Sections 6.3(a)(iii), 6.3(b) or 6.3(c),   and   (ii) other than in the case of fraud, the aggregate liability of the Seller Parties   for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(ii) and Section 6.3(a)(i) with respect to   Fundamental Representations, shall not exceed the Closing Consideration.   (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary and with respect solely   to breaches of the representations and warranties contained in Article 3 or Article 4 (excluding   the Fundamental Representations) as provided for pursuant to Sections 6.2(a) and 6.3(a)(i), an   Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Adverse Consequences sustained by the   Indemnitee unless and until the aggregate amount of all Adverse Consequences sustained by the   Indemnitee exceeds $50,000 (the  Deductible ), in which event the Indemnifying Party shall   provide indemnification hereunder in respect of all such indemnifiable Adverse Consequences in   excess of the Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitation contained in this Section   6.4(e) will not apply to claims for indemnification under Sections 6.2(b), 6.2(c) or 6.2(d) or   Sections 6.3(a)(ii), 6.3(a)(iii), 6.3(b) or 6.3(c). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to   the contrary, for purposes of the Parties  indemnification obligations under this Article 6, all of   the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or any certificate or schedule that   are qualified as to  material,   materiality,   material respects,  or words of similar import or   effect shall be deemed to have been made without any such qualification for purposes of   determining (i) whether a breach of any such representation or warranty has occurred and (ii) the   amount of Adverse Consequences resulting from, arising out of or relating to any such breach of   representation or warranty.   (f) If the Indemnitee receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of   any Adverse Consequences and the Indemnitee could have recovered all or a part of such     

-23-   Adverse Consequences from a third party based on the underlying claim asserted against the   Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall assign such of its rights to proceed against such third party as   are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from such third party the amount of   such indemnification payment; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing,   Purchaser shall have no obligation to assign any rights to an Indemnifying Party with respect to   any third parties with which Purchaser maintains a business relationships (including, but not   limited to, clients, carriers or employees).   (g) Notwithstanding the fact that any party may have the right to assert claims for   indemnification under or in respect of more than one provision of this Agreement or another   agreement entered into in connection herewith in respect of any fact, event, condition or   circumstance, no Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover the amount of any Adverse   Consequences suffered by such Indemnitee more than once under all such agreements in respect   of such fact, event, condition or circumstance.   (h) Except as contemplated by Section 6.4(c) and Article 9, the Parties agree that,   from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties for any Adverse   Consequences based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this   Agreement (including representations, warranties, covenants and agreements) and the   transactions contemplated hereby, whether based in contract or tort, are the indemnification and   reimbursement obligations of the Parties set forth in this Article 6.   6.5 Matters Involving Third Parties.   (a) If any Seller Indemnitees or Purchaser Indemnitees (an  Indemnitee ) entitled to   seek indemnification under this Article 6 receives notice of the assertion, commencement or   institution of a claim, suit, action or proceeding, or the imposition of a penalty or assessment by a   third party that is not an Indemnitee (a  Third-Party Claim ), and the Indemnitee intends to   seek indemnification hereunder for such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnitee shall promptly   provide the party against whom such indemnification may be sought (the  Indemnifying   Party ) with written notice of such Third-Party Claim (including any written demand,   complaint, petition, summons or similar document relating thereto that is then in the   Indemnitee s possession), but in any event not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of notice   of such Third-Party Claim. Any delay in providing, or the failure to provide such notification,   shall not affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification hereunder except in the event that   such delay or failure extends past the applicable survival expiration date set forth in Section 6.1,   or to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by the delay or failure.   (b) In connection with any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect, by   written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume and control, at its sole expense, the defense of any   such Third-Party Claim, and shall, at its sole expense, retain counsel (reasonably satisfactory to   the Indemnitee) in connection therewith; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will not   have such right:   (i) unless the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing, within 20   days following the Indemnifying Party s receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, to such     

-24-   Indemnitee the election of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of the Third Party   Claim;   (ii) unless the Indemnifying Party has provided to such Indemnitee reasonable   evidence that the Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources to defend such Third-   Party Claim;   (iii) if the applicable Indemnitee reasonably and in good faith believes that   such Third-Party Claim would be reasonably detrimental to the reputation, relations with   insurance carriers, brokers, Clients or suppliers, or business of the Indemnitee or any of its   Affiliates and such Third Party Claim involves relief other than monetary damages;   (iv) if such Third-Party Claim involves criminal allegations; or   (v) if outside counsel reasonably acceptable to the Parties advises the   Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee in writing that there are actual, unresolvable conflicting   interests between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee with respect to the Third-Party   Claim.   (c) After the assumption of such defense by the Indemnifying Party, the   Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for the payment of legal fees or expenses incurred   thereafter by the Indemnitee (who may, however, continue to participate in, but not control, the   defense of such Third-Party Claim with separate counsel and at its own expense other than as   provided in Section 6.5(b)).   (d) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of the Third-   Party Claim, it shall not settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim unless either (i) the   Indemnitee gives its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned,   withheld or delayed, or (ii) the terms of settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim   provide that the Indemnitee shall have no responsibility for the discharge of any settlement   amount and impose no other obligations or duties on the Indemnitee (including any admission of   culpability), and the settlement or compromise discharges all claims against the Indemnitee with   respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the defense of any such   Third-Party Claim and shall provide such personnel, technical support and access to information   as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense.   (e) If the Indemnifying Party does not or does not have the right to undertake the   defense, compromise or settlement of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 6.5(b), the   Indemnitee will have the right to control the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim   with counsel of its choosing (reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party) but shall not   settle or compromise such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party   (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Indemnifying Party   will be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of any Third-Party Claim with   separate counsel and at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the   defense of any such Third-Party Claim and shall provide such personnel, technical support and     

-25-   access to information as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnitee in connection with such   defense.   6.6 Notice of, and Procedures in respect of, Direct Claims.   (a) Any claim for indemnification of Adverse Consequences under this Article 6 that   is not a Third-Party Claim (a  Direct Claim ) by an Indemnitee shall be asserted by giving the   Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof; provided, however, that any delay in   providing, or the failure to provide such notification, shall not affect the right of the Indemnitee   to indemnification hereunder except in the event that such delay or failure extends past the   applicable survival expiration date set forth in Section 6.1, or to the extent that the Indemnifying   Party is materially prejudiced by the delay or failure. Such notice shall describe the Direct Claim   in reasonable detail, including (to the extent practicable) copies of any written evidence thereof   and indicate the estimated amount of Adverse Consequences, if reasonably practicable, that has   been sustained by the Indemnitee.   (b) The Indemnifying Party will have a period of thirty (30) calendar days following   receipt of the Indemnitee s written notice of a Direct Claim within which to dispute in writing its   liability with respect thereto or the amount thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not timely so   respond within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted the   liability under such Direct Claim, in which event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue   such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party pursuant to, and on the terms and   subject to the provisions of, this Article 6. If the Indemnifying Party does so respond within   such 30-day period, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee shall resolve such dispute   first by negotiation among the Parties and then, to the extent not so resolved by negotiation, in   accordance with Article 15.   ARTICLE 7. POST-CLOSING COVENANTS   7.1 Cooperation. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other to facilitate the orderly   transfer of the Acquired Assets and Seller Business to Purchaser, including but not limited to,   certifying, executing or transferring all necessary documents and information to Purchaser as   may be reasonably required by Purchaser. After the Closing, each of the Parties agrees to give   access to the other and to provide and/or execute such documents as may be reasonably   requested by the other in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and   hereunder.   7.2 Post Closing Payments; Bank Accounts.

Any such amounts received by the Seller   Parties will be held in trust for Purchaser. Any cash (including, without limitation, any cash with   respect to Accounts Receivable or any of the other Acquired Assets) paid or deposited into the

(a) As of the Closing, Purchaser shall have offered employment effective as of the   day after the Closing Date to all persons listed on Schedule 5.2(e) on such terms and conditions   of employment as Purchaser shall have determined. All such employees accepting said offer of   employment shall be referred to herein as  Transferred Employees . For the avoidance of   doubt, Purchaser will not offer employment to any member of Seller s title insurance staff.   (b) Purchaser will credit the Transferred Employees with service for time employed   by Seller for purposes of (i) vesting for and eligibility to participate in any  employee benefit   plan  within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by Purchaser in which the   Transferred Employees are eligible to participate, but not for purposes of benefit accruals; (ii)   any waiting periods, eligibility or pre-existing condition limitations for any health and welfare   plan of Purchaser; and (iii) eligibility and benefit computation for paid time off plans of   Purchaser.   (c) Seller shall retain all liabilities and obligations (i) arising from or relating to the   employment of any Transferred Employees for periods on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii)   arising from or relating to the employment of any employees of Seller or any of their Affiliates   who do not become Transferred Employees, whether such liabilities and obligations arise on,   prior to or after the Closing Date and (iii) under or relating to any Employee Plan or any other   employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Seller or any ERISA Affiliate (as such term is   defined in ERISA) of Seller.   (d) Purchaser shall be solely liable for all obligations (i) arising from or relating to the   employment of any Transferred Employees for periods after the Closing Date, and (ii) under or   relating to any Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of   Purchaser or any ERISA Affiliate (as such term is defined in ERISA) of Purchaser.   (e) No provision in this Section 7.3 shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary or   other rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent   thereof) of Seller or any other Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors   and permitted assigns, (ii) create any rights to continued employment with Purchaser or any USI   Company or (iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any employee benefit   plan sponsored or maintained by Purchaser or any USI Company.   7.4 Post-Closing Arrangements.

For all other lines of insurance of the Holding Corporation being   serviced at Closing by insurance brokers other than Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than     

-27-   any bank-owned life insurance policies), the Holding Corporation will, prior to each renewal   thereof, permit Purchaser (or one of its Affiliates) to present a proposal to the Holding   Corporation for such other lines of insurance. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4 to   the contrary, no Acquiror of the Holding Corporation (either through merger or by acquiring   substantially all of the assets of the Holding Corporation) shall be subject to or bound by the   obligations set forth in this Section 7.4 following the consummation of an Acquisition   Transaction; provided that such Acquiror of the Holding Corporation pays Purchaser an amount   equal to the product of the (i) the aggregate revenue of Purchaser with respect to all lines of   insurance serviced by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.4 for the twelve (12) month period   ending as of the date when the Acquisition Transaction is consummated multiplied by (ii) 2.3, no   later than the date when the Acquisition Transaction is consummated.   7.5 Office Equipment.

To the extent that the Holding Corporation   reasonably determines, based on such market checks that the pricing offered to the Holding   Corporation (and its Affiliates) on any insurance policies otherwise subject to Section 7.4 is not   competitive with pricing available from other insurance brokers (such rates,  Competitive   Rates ), the Holding Corporation (or its applicable Affiliate) shall, notwithstanding Section 7.4   to the contrary, be permitted to move such policies to such other insurance brokers; provided,   however, that the Holding Corporation may not exercise the rights contemplated in this Section   without first (i) providing Purchaser with written notice of the insurance policies that are not   competitive with the applicable Competitive Rates and setting out the differences between the   rates quoted by Purchaser and the Competitive Rates and (ii) providing Purchaser with an   opportunity within a thirty (30) day period after the receipt of such written notice to obtain   reasonably competitive rates.

(c) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and   other such Taxes, and recording, filing and other fees (including any penalties and interest),   incurred in connection with the consummation of the sale of the Acquired Assets pursuant to this   Agreement shall be paid by the applicable Seller Party when due, and such Seller Party will, at   its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such   transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees.   ARTICLE 9. RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.   9.1 The Seller Parties acknowledge and agree that substantial and valuable assets are being   transferred to Purchaser hereunder that include Confidential Information, relationships with   Clients and Active Prospective Clients, and associated Goodwill of the Seller Parties, that the   relationships which Purchaser (including as a result of this transaction) has with its employees   and Producers are significant business relationships necessary for Purchaser to continue to   operate the business being acquired hereunder and the Acquired Assets, and that Purchaser, as a   result of this transaction, shall be engaged in providing Seller Business throughout the Restricted   Territory. The Seller Parties further acknowledge and agree that Purchaser and each of the other   USI Companies has a reasonable, necessary and legitimate business interest in protecting the   aforesaid assets and relationships and businesses, and that the covenants set forth below are   reasonable and necessary in order to protect these legitimate business interests. The Seller   Parties further acknowledge and agree that the payment of the Purchase Price shall constitute,   among other things, full consideration for such covenants, and the associated Goodwill included   in the Acquired Assets. In addition, the Seller Parties acknowledge and agree that monetary   damages will not be an adequate remedy for any material breach of any of the Restrictive   Covenants and that irreparable injury may result to Purchaser and/or the other USI Companies,   or their successors in interest. (Reference is made to Section 6.4(c) hereof relating to the rights   of the USI Companies to equitable relief for any breach of the Restrictive Covenants.)

In addition, each Seller Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent   any such prohibited use or disclosure by its directors, officers, employees, Producers or agents.   (b) No Seller Party will, and no Seller Party will cause or permit any of its Affiliates,   successors or assigns to, directly or indirectly, solicit the provision of any Seller Business from,   or provide, accept any offer to provide or otherwise induce the termination or non-renewal of any   Seller Business to, any Client or Active Prospective Client.
