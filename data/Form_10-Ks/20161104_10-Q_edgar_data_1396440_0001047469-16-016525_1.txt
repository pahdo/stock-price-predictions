(1)    All
investments are Lower Middle Market portfolio investments, unless otherwise noted. See Note B for a description of Lower Middle Market portfolio
investments. All of the Company's investments, unless otherwise noted, are encumbered either as security for the Company's Credit Agreement or in support of the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by the
Funds.
      (2)    Debt
investments are income producing, unless otherwise noted. Equity and warrants are non-income producing, unless otherwise noted.
      (3)    See
Note C for a summary of geographic location of portfolio companies.
      (4)    Principal
is net of repayments. Cost is net of repayments and accumulated unearned income.
      (5)    Control
investments are defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act") as investments in which more than 25% of the voting securities are
owned or where the ability to nominate greater than 50% of the board representation is maintained.
      (6)    Affiliate
investments are defined by the 1940 Act as investments in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned and the investments are not
classified as Control investments.
      (7)    Non-Control/Non-Affiliate
investments are defined by the 1940 Act as investments that are neither Control investments nor Affiliate investments.
      (8)    Income
producing through dividends or distributions.
      (9)    Index
based floating interest rate is subject to contractual minimum interest rate. A majority of the variable rate loans in the Company's investment portfolio bear
interest at a rate that may be determined by reference to either LIBOR or an alternate Base Rate (commonly based on the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate), which typically resets semi-annually,
quarterly, or monthly at the borrower's option. The borrower may also elect to have multiple interest reset periods for each loan. For each such loan, the Company has provided the weighted average
annual stated interest rate in effect at September 30, 2016. As noted in this schedule, 62% (based on the par amount of the loans) of the loans contain LIBOR floors which range between 0.25%
and 2.25%.
      (10)    Private
Loan portfolio investment. See Note B for a description of Private Loan portfolio investments.
      (11)    Middle
Market portfolio investment. See Note B for a description of Middle Market portfolio investments.
      (12)    Other
Portfolio investment. See Note B for a description of Other Portfolio investments.
      (13)    Investment
is not a qualifying asset as defined under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Qualifying assets must represent at least 70% of total assets at the
time of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets.
      (14)    Non-accrual
and non-income producing investment.
      (15)    Marketable
securities and idle fund investments.
      (16)    External
Investment Manager. Investment is not encumbered as security for the Company's Credit Agreement or in support of the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by
the Funds.
      (17)    Maturity
date is under on-going negotiations with the portfolio company and other lenders, if applicable.
      (18)    Portfolio
company is in a bankruptcy process and, as such, the maturity date of our debt investments in this portfolio company will not be finally determined until
such process is complete. As noted in footnote (14), our debt investments in this portfolio company are on non-accrual status.

NOTE A ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION     

   1.     Organization     

          Main Street Capital Corporation ("MSCC") is a principal investment firm primarily focused on providing customized debt and equity financing to lower middle market
("LMM") companies and debt capital to middle market ("Middle Market") companies. The portfolio investments of MSCC and its consolidated subsidiaries are typically made to support management buyouts,
recapitalizations, growth financings, refinancings and acquisitions of companies that operate in diverse industry sectors. MSCC
seeks to partner with entrepreneurs, business owners and management teams and generally provides "one stop" financing alternatives within its LMM portfolio. MSCC and its consolidated subsidiaries
invest primarily in secured debt investments, equity investments, warrants and other securities of LMM companies based in the United States and in secured debt investments of Middle Market companies
generally headquartered in the United States.   

          MSCC
was formed in March 2007 to operate as an internally managed business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). MSCC wholly
owns several investment funds, including Main Street Mezzanine Fund, LP ("MSMF"), Main Street Capital II, LP ("MSC II") and Main Street Capital III, LP ("MSC III" and,
collectively with MSMF and MSC II, the "Funds"), and each of their general partners. The Funds are each licensed as a Small Business Investment Company ("SBIC") by the United States Small Business
Administration ("SBA"). Because MSCC is internally managed, all of the executive officers and other employees are employed by MSCC. Therefore, MSCC does not pay any external investment advisory fees
but instead directly incurs the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals.   

          MSC
Adviser I, LLC (the "External Investment Manager") was formed in November 2013 as a wholly owned subsidiary of MSCC to provide investment management and other services to
parties other than MSCC and its subsidiaries or their portfolio companies ("External Parties") and receives fee income for such services. MSCC has been granted no-action relief by the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") to allow the External Investment Manager to register as a registered investment adviser ("RIA") under Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act").
Since the External Investment Manager conducts all of its investment management activities for External Parties, it is accounted for as a portfolio investment of MSCC and is not included as a
consolidated subsidiary of MSCC in MSCC's consolidated financial statements.   

          MSCC
has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"). As a result, MSCC generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes to its stockholders.   

          MSCC
has certain direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that have elected to be taxable entities (the "Taxable Subsidiaries"). The primary purpose of the Taxable Subsidiaries is
to permit MSCC to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are "pass-through" entities for tax purposes. The External Investment Manager is also a direct wholly owned subsidiary that has
elected to be a taxable entity. The Taxable Subsidiaries and the External Investment Manager are each taxed at their normal corporate tax rates based on their taxable income.

          Unless
otherwise noted or the context otherwise indicates, the terms "we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Main Street" refer to MSCC and its consolidated subsidiaries, which include the
Funds and the Taxable Subsidiaries.   

2.     Basis of Presentation     

          Main Street's financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").
For each of the periods presented herein, Main Street's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MSCC and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Investment Portfolio, as used herein,
refers to all of Main Street's investments in LMM portfolio companies, investments in Middle Market portfolio companies, Private Loan portfolio investments, Other Portfolio investments, and the
investment in the External Investment Manager, but excludes all "Marketable securities and idle funds investments" (see Note C Fair Value Hierarchy for Investments and
Debentures Portfolio Composition Investment Portfolio Composition for additional discussion of Main Street's Investment Portfolio and definitions for the terms Private Loan and
Other Portfolio). "Marketable securities and idle funds investments" are classified as financial instruments and are reported separately on Main Street's consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
schedules of investments due to the nature of such investments (see Note B.11.). Main Street's results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash
flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and financial position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are presented on a consolidated basis. The
effects of all intercompany transactions between Main Street and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.   

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Main Street are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the
requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP are omitted. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial results included herein contain all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals,
considered necessary for the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim periods included herein. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Also, the unaudited financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015. Financial statements prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis require management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could
impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.   

          Under
regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X applicable to BDCs and Accounting Standards Codification ("Codification" or "ASC") 946,     Financial Services Investment Companies   
("ASC 946"), Main Street is precluded from consolidating other entities in which Main Street
has equity investments, including those in which it has a controlling interest, unless the other entity is another investment company. An exception to this general principle in ASC 946 occurs if Main
Street holds a controlling interest in an operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to Main Street or to its portfolio companies. Accordingly, as noted above,
MSCC's consolidated financial statements include the financial position and operating results for the Funds and the Taxable Subsidiaries. MSCC's consolidated financial statements also include the
financial position and operating results for MSCC's wholly owned operating subsidiary, Main Street Capital Partners, LLC ("MSCP"),

  as
MSCP provides all of its services directly or indirectly to Main Street or its portfolio companies. Main Street has determined that all of its portfolio investments do not qualify for this
exception, including the investment in the External Investment Manager. Therefore, Main Street's Investment Portfolio is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, as discussed further
in Note B, with any adjustments to fair value recognized as "Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)" on the consolidated statements of operations until the investment is realized,
usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss being recognized as a "Net Realized Gain (Loss)."   

Portfolio Investment Classification      

Main Street classifies its Investment Portfolio in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, (a) "Control
Investments" are defined as investments in which Main Street owns more than 25% of the voting securities or has rights to maintain greater than 50% of the board representation, (b) "Affiliate
Investments" are defined as investments in which Main Street owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities and does not have rights to maintain greater than 50% of the board representation and
(c) "Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments" are defined as investments that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.   

NOTE B SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

   1.     Valuation of the Investment Portfolio     

          Main Street accounts for its Investment Portfolio at fair value. As a result, Main Street follows the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") ASC 820,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures    ("ASC 820"). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires Main Street to assume
that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the
principal market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact.   

          Main
Street's portfolio strategy calls for it to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by private, LMM companies and more liquid debt securities issued by Middle
Market companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies. Main Street categorizes some of its investments in LMM companies and Middle Market companies as Private Loan portfolio
investments, which are primarily debt securities in privately held companies which have been originated through strategic relationships with other investment funds on a collaborative basis, and are
often referred to in the debt markets as "club deals." Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to investments Main Street holds in its LMM portfolio and
Middle Market portfolio. Main Street's portfolio also includes Other Portfolio investments which primarily consist of investments that are not consistent with the typical profiles for its LMM
portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments or Private Loan portfolio investments, including investments which may be managed by third parties. Main Street's portfolio investments may
be subject to restrictions on resale.   

          LMM
investments and Other Portfolio investments generally have no established trading market while Middle Market securities generally have established markets that are not active.
Private Loan investments may include investments which have no established trading market or have established markets that are not active. Main Street determines in good faith the fair value of its
Investment Portfolio pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with ASC 820 and a valuation process approved   

  62  

Table of Contents   

MAIN STREET CAPITAL CORPORATION    

    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

  by
its Board of Directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act. Main Street's valuation policies and processes are intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of Main Street's
Investment Portfolio.   

          For
LMM portfolio investments, Main Street generally reviews external events, including private mergers, sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies, and includes these events
in the valuation process by using an enterprise value waterfall methodology ("Waterfall") for its LMM equity
investments and an income approach using a yield-to-maturity model ("Yield-to-Maturity") for its LMM debt investments. For Middle Market portfolio investments, Main Street primarily uses quoted prices
in the valuation process. Main Street determines the appropriateness of the use of third-party broker quotes, if any, in determining fair value based on its understanding of the level of actual
transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer, the depth and consistency of broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker
quotes with underlying performance of the portfolio company and other market indices. For Middle Market and Private Loan portfolio investments in debt securities for which it has determined that
third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, Main Street generally estimates the fair value based on the assumptions that it believes hypothetical market
participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method. For its Other Portfolio equity investments, Main Street generally calculates
the fair value of the investment primarily based on the net asset value ("NAV") of the fund and adjusts the fair value for other factors that would affect the fair value of the investment. All of the
valuation approaches for Main Street's portfolio investments estimate the value of the investment as if Main Street were to sell, or exit, the investment as of the measurement date.   

These
valuation approaches consider the value associated with Main Street's ability to control the capital structure of the portfolio company, as well as the timing of a potential exit.
For valuation purposes, "control" portfolio investments are composed of debt and equity securities in companies for which Main Street has a controlling interest in the equity ownership of the
portfolio company or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company's board of directors. For valuation purposes, "non-control" portfolio investments are generally composed of debt and
equity securities in companies for which Main Street does not have a controlling interest in the equity ownership of the portfolio company or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio
company's board of directors.   

          Under
the Waterfall valuation method, Main Street estimates the enterprise value of a portfolio company using a combination of market and income approaches or other appropriate valuation
methods, such as considering recent transactions in the equity securities of the portfolio company or third-party valuations of the portfolio company, and then performs a waterfall calculation by
allocating the enterprise value over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another. The enterprise value is the fair value at which an enterprise could be
sold in a transaction between two willing parties, other than through a forced or liquidation sale. Typically, private companies are bought and sold based on multiples of earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), cash flows, net income, revenues, or in limited cases, book value. There is no single methodology for estimating enterprise value. For any one
portfolio company, enterprise value is generally described as a range of values from which a single estimate of enterprise value is derived. In estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company,
Main Street analyzes various factors including the portfolio company's historical and projected financial results. Due to SEC deadlines for Main Street's quarterly and annual financial reporting, the
operating results of a portfolio company used in the current period valuation are generally the results from the period ended three months prior   

  63  

Table of Contents

  to
such valuation date and may include unaudited, projected, budgeted or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for non-recurring items or to normalize the operating results that
may require significant judgment in its determination. In addition, projecting future financial results requires significant judgment regarding future growth assumptions. In evaluating the operating
results, Main Street also analyzes the impact of exposure to litigation, loss of customers or other contingencies. After determining the appropriate enterprise value, Main Street allocates the
enterprise value to investments in order of the legal priority of the various components of the portfolio company's capital structure. In applying the Waterfall valuation method, Main Street assumes
the loans are paid off at the principal amount in a change in control transaction and are not assumed by the buyer, which Main Street believes is consistent with its past transaction history and
standard industry practices.   

          Under
the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method, Main Street also uses the income approach to determine the fair value of debt securities based on projections of the discounted future free
cash flows that the debt security will likely generate, including analyzing the discounted cash flows of interest and principal amounts for the debt security, as set forth in the associated loan
agreements, as well as the financial position and credit risk of the portfolio company. Main Street's estimate of the expected repayment date of its debt securities is generally the maturity date of
the instrument, as Main Street generally intends to hold its loans and debt securities to maturity. The Yield-to-Maturity analysis also considers changes in leverage levels, credit quality, portfolio
company performance and other factors. Main Street will generally use the value determined by the Yield-to-Maturity analysis as the fair value for that security; however, because of Main Street's
general intent to hold its loans to maturity, the fair value will not exceed the principal amount of the debt security valued using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method. A change in the assumptions
that Main Street uses to estimate the fair value of its debt securities using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method could have a material impact on the determination of fair value. If there is
deterioration in credit quality or if a debt security is in workout status, Main Street may consider other factors in determining the fair value of the debt security, including the value attributable
to the debt security from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would most likely be received in a liquidation analysis.   

Under
the NAV valuation method, for an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, Main Street measures the fair value of the investment
predominately based on the NAV of the investment fund as of the measurement date and adjusts the investment's fair value for factors known to Main Street that would affect that fund's NAV, including,
but not limited to, fair values for individual investments held by the fund if Main Street holds the same investment or for a publicly traded investment. In addition, in determining the fair value of
the investment, Main Street considers whether adjustments to the NAV are necessary in certain circumstances, based on the analysis of any restrictions on redemption of Main Street's investment as of
the measurement date, recent actual sales or redemptions of interests in the investment fund, and expected future cash flows available to equity holders, including the rate of return on those cash
flows compared to an implied market return on equity required by market participants, or other uncertainties surrounding Main Street's ability to realize the full NAV of its interests in the
investment fund.   

          Pursuant
to its internal valuation process and the requirements under the 1940 Act, Main Street performs valuation procedures on each of its portfolio investments quarterly. In addition
to its internal valuation process, in arriving at estimates of fair value for its investments in its LMM portfolio companies, Main Street, among other things, consults with a nationally recognized
independent financial advisory services firm. The nationally recognized independent financial advisory services firm analyzes and provides observations, recommendations and an assurance certification
regarding the

    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

  Company's
determinations of the fair value of its LMM portfolio company investments. The nationally recognized independent financial advisory services firm is generally consulted relative to Main
Street's investments in each LMM portfolio company at least once every calendar year, and for Main Street's investments in new LMM portfolio companies, at least once in the twelve-month period
subsequent to the initial investment. In certain instances, Main Street may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in its stockholders' best interest, to consult with the
nationally recognized independent financial advisory services firm on its investments in one or more LMM portfolio companies. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair
value of Main Street's investment in a LMM portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total Investment Portfolio. Main Street consulted with and received an assurance
certification from its independent financial advisory services firm in arriving at Main Street's determination of fair value on its investments in a total of 46 LMM portfolio companies for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, representing approximately 75% of the total LMM portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2016, and on a total of 44 LMM portfolio companies for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing approximately 75% of the total LMM portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2015. Excluding investments in new LMM portfolio
companies which have not been in the Investment Portfolio for at least twelve months subsequent to the initial investment as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, and investments in
the LMM portfolio companies that were not reviewed because their equity is publicly traded, the percentage of the LMM portfolio reviewed and certified by the independent financial advisory services
firm for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 80% and 82% of the total LMM portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

          For
valuation purposes, all of Main Street's Middle Market portfolio investments are non-control investments. To the extent sufficient observable inputs are available to determine fair
value, Main Street uses observable inputs to determine the fair value of these investments through obtaining third-party quotes or other independent pricing. For Middle Market portfolio investments
for which it has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, Main Street generally estimates the fair value based on the assumptions that it
believes hypothetical market participants would use to value such Middle Market debt investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method and such Middle Market
equity investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Waterfall valuation method. Because almost all of the Middle Market portfolio investments are typically valued using third party quotes or
other independent pricing services (including 97% and 99% of the Middle Market portfolio investments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively), Main Street does not
generally consult with any financial advisory services firms in connection with determining the fair value of its Middle Market investments.   

For
valuation purposes, all of Main Street's Private Loan portfolio investments are non-control investments. For Private Loan portfolio investments for which it has determined that
third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, Main Street generally estimates the fair value based on the assumptions that it believes hypothetical market
participants would use to value such Private Loan debt investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method and such Private Loan equity investments in a current
hypothetical sale using the Waterfall valuation method.   

          In
addition to its internal valuation process, in arriving at estimates of fair value for its investments in its Private Loan portfolio companies, Main Street, among other things,
consults with a nationally recognized independent financial advisory services firm. The nationally recognized independent

  financial
advisory services firm analyzes and provides observations and recommendations and an assurance certification regarding the Company's determinations of the fair value of its Private Loan
portfolio company investments. The nationally recognized independent financial advisory services firm is generally consulted relative to Main Street's investments in each Private Loan portfolio
company at least once every calendar year, and for Main Street's investments in new Private Loan portfolio companies, at least once in the twelve-month period subsequent to the initial investment. In
certain instances, Main Street may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in its stockholders' best interest, to consult with the nationally recognized independent financial
advisory services firm on its investments in one or more Private Loan portfolio companies. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of Main Street's investment
in a Private Loan portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total Investment Portfolio. Main Street consulted with and received an assurance certification from its
independent financial advisory services firm in arriving at its determination of fair value on its investments in a total of 20 Private Loan portfolio companies for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, representing approximately 56% of the total Private Loan portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2016, and on a total of 11 Private Loan portfolio companies for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing approximately 37% of the total Private Loan portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2015. Excluding its investments in new
Private Loan portfolio companies which have not been in the Investment Portfolio for at least twelve months subsequent to the initial investment decision as of September 30, 2016 and its
investments in the Private Loan portfolio companies that were not reviewed because the investment is publicly traded or quoted by banks, the percentage of the Private Loan portfolio reviewed and
certified by its independent financial advisory services firm for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 80% and 84% of the total Private Loan portfolio at fair value as of
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

          For
valuation purposes, all of Main Street's Other Portfolio investments are non-control investments. Main Street's Other Portfolio investments comprised 4.9% and 4.2%, respectively, of
Main Street's Investment Portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Similar to the LMM investment portfolio, market quotations for Other Portfolio equity
investments are generally not readily
available. For its Other Portfolio equity investments, Main Street generally determines the fair value of its investments using the NAV valuation method. For Other Portfolio debt investments for which
it has determined that third-party quotes or other independent pricing are not available or appropriate, Main Street generally estimates the fair value based on the assumptions that it believes
hypothetical market participants would use to value such Other Portfolio debt investments in a current hypothetical sale using the Yield-to-Maturity valuation method. For Other Portfolio debt
investments for which third-party quotes or other independent pricing are available and appropriate, Main Street determines the fair value of these investments through obtaining third party quotes or
other independent pricing to the extent that these inputs are available and appropriate to determine fair value.   

          For
valuation purposes, Main Street's investment in the External Investment Manager is a control investment. Market quotations are not readily available for this investment, and as a
result, Main Street determines the fair value of the External Investment Manager using the Waterfall valuation method under the market approach. In estimating the enterprise value, Main Street
analyzes various factors, including the entity's historical and projected financial results, as well as its size, marketability and performance relative to the population of market comparables. This
valuation approach estimates the value of the investment as if Main Street were to sell, or exit, the investment. In addition, Main Street

  considers
its ability to control the capital structure of the company, as well as the timing of a potential exit, in connection with determining the fair value of the External Investment Manager.   

          Due
to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, Main Street's determination of fair value for its Investment Portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have
been determined had a ready market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the
investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. Main Street determines the fair value of each
individual investment and records changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.   

          Main
Street uses an internally developed portfolio investment rating system in connection with its investment oversight, portfolio management and analysis and investment valuation
procedures for its LMM portfolio companies. This system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the LMM portfolio company and the investments held therein.   

          The
Board of Directors of Main Street has the final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, Main Street's determination of the fair value for its
Investment Portfolio, as well as its valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. Main Street believes its Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 approximates fair value as of
those dates based on the markets in which Main Street operates and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.   

   2.     Use of Estimates     

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions. Additionally, as explained in Note B.1., the
financial statements include investments in the Investment Portfolio whose values have been estimated by Main Street with the oversight, review and approval by Main Street's Board of Directors in the
absence of readily ascertainable market values. Because of the inherent uncertainty of the Investment Portfolio valuations, those estimated values may differ materially from the values that would have
been determined had a ready market for the securities existed.   

3.     Cash and Cash Equivalents     

          Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash and cash
equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.   

          At
September 30, 2016, cash balances totaling $29.0 million exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance protection levels, subjecting the Company to risk
related to the uninsured balance. All of the Company's cash deposits are held at large, established, high credit quality financial institutions and management believes that the risk of loss associated
with any uninsured balances is remote.

   4.     Marketable Securities and Idle Funds Investments     

Marketable securities and idle funds investments include intermediate-term secured debt investments, independently rated debt investments and publicly traded debt
and equity investments. See the consolidated schedule of investments for more information on Marketable securities and idle funds investments.   

   5.     Interest, Dividend and Fee Income (Structuring and Advisory Services)     

          Main Street records interest and dividend income on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded as dividends
are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. In
accordance with Main Street's valuation policies, Main Street evaluates accrued interest and dividend income periodically for collectability. When a loan or debt security becomes 90 days or
more past due, and if Main Street otherwise does not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, Main Street will generally place the loan or debt security on
non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a loan or debt
security's status significantly improves regarding the debtor's ability to service the debt or other obligations, or if a loan or debt security is fully impaired, sold or written off, Main Street
removes it from non-accrual status.   

          Main
Street holds certain debt and preferred equity instruments in its Investment Portfolio that contain payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest and cumulative dividend provisions. The PIK
interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection
of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. Cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income, and any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of the
preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed or sold. To maintain RIC tax treatment (as
discussed in Note B.9. below), these non-cash sources of income may need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions, even though Main Street may not have collected the PIK
interest and cumulative dividends in cash. Main Street stops accruing PIK interest and cumulative dividends and writes off any accrued and uncollected interest and dividends in arrears when it
determines that such PIK interest and dividends in arrears are no longer collectible. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, (i) approximately 4.0% and 2.2%,
respectively, of Main Street's total investment income was attributable to PIK interest income not paid currently in cash and (ii) approximately 1.8% and 1.2%, respectively, of Main Street's
total investment income was attributable to cumulative dividend income not paid currently in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, (i) approximately 3.7% and 2.1%,
respectively, of Main Street's total investment income was attributable to PIK interest income not paid currently in cash and (ii) approximately 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively, of Main Street's
total investment income was attributable to cumulative dividend income not paid currently in cash.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, Main Street's total Investment Portfolio had five investments on non-accrual status, which comprised approximately 0.4% of its fair value and 2.8% of its
cost. As of December 31, 2015, Main Street's total Investment Portfolio had six investments on non-accrual status, which comprised approximately 0.4% of its fair value and 3.7% of its cost.

          Main
Street may periodically provide services, including structuring and advisory services, to its portfolio companies or other third parties. For services that are separately
identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value, fee income is recognized as earned, which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes. Fees received in
connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are deferred and accreted into income over the life of the financing.   

A
presentation of the investment income Main Street received from its Investment Portfolio in each of the periods presented is as follows:   

6.     Deferred Financing Costs     

          Deferred financing costs include SBIC debenture commitment fees and SBIC debenture leverage fees on the SBIC debentures which are not accounted for under the fair
value option under ASC 825 (as discussed further in Note B.11.). These fees are approximately 3.4% of the total commitment and drawn amounts, as applicable. These deferred financing costs have
been capitalized and are being amortized into interest expense over the ten year term of each debenture agreement.   

Deferred
financing costs also include commitment fees and other costs related to Main Street's multi-year revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility," as discussed further in
Note F) and its notes (as discussed further in Note G). These costs have been capitalized and are amortized into interest expense over the term of the individual instrument.   

   7.     Unearned Income Debt Origination Fees and Original Issue Discount and Discounts / Premiums to Par Value     

          Main Street capitalizes debt origination fees received in connection with financings and reflects such fees as unearned income netted against the applicable debt
investments. The unearned income from the fees is accreted into interest income based on the effective interest method over the life of the financing.   

          In
connection with its portfolio debt investments, Main Street sometimes receives nominal cost warrants or warrants with an exercise price below the fair value of the underlying equity
(together, "nominal cost equity") that are valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company. When Main Street receives nominal cost equity, Main Street allocates its
cost basis in its investment between its debt security and its nominal cost equity at the time of origination based on amounts negotiated with the particular portfolio company. The allocated amounts
are based upon the fair value of the nominal cost equity, which is then used to determine the allocation of cost to the debt security. Any discount recorded on a debt investment resulting from this
allocation is reflected as

  unearned
income, which is netted against the applicable debt investment, and accreted into interest income based on the effective interest method over the life of the debt investment. The actual
collection of this interest is deferred until the time of debt principal repayment.   

          Main
Street may also purchase debt securities at a discount or at a premium to the par value of the debt security. In the case of a purchase at a discount, Main Street records the
investment at the par value of the debt security net of the discount, and the discount is accreted into interest income based on the effective interest method over the life of the debt investment. In
the case of a purchase at a premium, Main Street records the investment at the par value of the debt security plus the premium, and the premium is amortized as a reduction to interest income based on
the effective interest method over the life of the debt investment.   

          To
maintain RIC tax treatment (as discussed in Note B.9. below), these non-cash sources of income may need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions, even though
Main Street may not have collected the interest income. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 3.2% and 2.3%, respectively, of Main Street's total investment
income was attributable to interest income for the accretion of discounts associated with debt investments, net of any premium reduction. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
approximately 3.0% and 2.7%, respectively, of Main Street's total investment income was attributable to interest income for the accretion of discounts associated with debt investments, net of any
premium reduction.   

   8.     Share-Based Compensation     

          Main Street accounts for its share-based compensation plans using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC 718,     Compensation Stock
Compensation.    Accordingly, for restricted stock awards, Main Street measures the grant date fair value based upon the
market price of its common stock on the date of the grant and amortizes the fair value of the awards as share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the
vesting term.   

          Effective
January 1, 2016, Main Street elected early adoption of ASU 2016-09,    Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting    ("ASU 2016-09," as discussed further below in Note B.13.). ASU 2016-09 requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies
(including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and no longer delay recognition of a tax benefit until
the tax benefit is realized through a reduction to taxes payable. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.
Additionally, ASU 2016-09 allows an entity to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest, net of forfeitures,
(current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures and
intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is
adopted. As such, Main Street has recorded a $1.8 million adjustment to "Net Unrealized Appreciation, Net of Income Taxes" on the consolidated balance sheet to capture the cumulative tax effect
as of January 1, 2016. The company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur and this change had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. The additional amendments (cash
flows classification, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements and classification of awards as either a liability or equity) did not have an effect on Main Street's consolidated financial
statements.

   9.     Income Taxes     

          MSCC has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC. MSCC's taxable income includes the taxable income generated by MSCC and certain of
its subsidiaries, including the Funds, which are treated as disregarded entities for tax purposes. As a RIC, MSCC generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net
ordinary income or capital gains that MSCC distributes to its stockholders. MSCC must generally distribute at least 90% of its "investment company taxable income" (which is generally its net ordinary
taxable income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) and 90% of its tax-exempt income to maintain its RIC status (pass-through tax treatment for
amounts distributed). As part of maintaining RIC status, undistributed taxable income (subject to a 4% non-deductible U.S Federal excise tax) pertaining to a given fiscal year may be distributed up to
12 months subsequent to the end of that fiscal year, provided such dividends are declared on or prior to the later of (i) the filing of the U.S federal income tax return for the
applicable fiscal year or (ii) the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the year in which such taxable income was generated.   

          The
Taxable Subsidiaries hold certain portfolio investments for Main Street. The Taxable Subsidiaries permit Main Street to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are
"pass-through" entities for tax purposes and to continue to comply with the "source-income" requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated with
Main Street for U.S. GAAP financial reporting purposes, and the portfolio investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries are included in Main Street's consolidated financial statements as
portfolio investments and recorded at fair value. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with MSCC for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and
liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The taxable income, or loss, of the Taxable Subsidiaries may differ from its book income, or loss, due to temporary book
and tax timing differences and permanent differences. This income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and the related tax assets and liabilities, are reflected in Main Street's consolidated financial
statements.   

          MSCP
is included in Main Street's consolidated financial statements for financial reporting purposes. For tax purposes, MSCP has elected to be treated as a taxable entity, and therefore
is not consolidated with MSCC for income tax purposes and is taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income and, as a result of its activities, may generate income tax expense or
benefit. The taxable income, or loss, of MSCP may differ from its book income, or loss, due to temporary book and tax timing differences and permanent differences. This income tax expense, or benefit,
if any, and the related tax assets and liabilities, are reflected in Main Street's consolidated financial statements.   

          The
Taxable Subsidiaries and MSCP use the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is provided, if necessary, against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.   

Taxable
income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses. Taxable income
generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.

   10.   Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation     

          Realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the sale or redemption of an investment or a financial instrument and the
cost basis of the investment or financial instrument, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, and includes investments written-off during the period net of
recoveries and realized gains or losses from in-kind redemptions. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the net change in the fair value of the Investment Portfolio and
financial instruments and the reclassification of any prior period unrealized appreciation or depreciation on exited investments and financial instruments to realized gains or losses.   

   11.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments     

          Fair value estimates are made at discrete points in time based on relevant information. These estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and
matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Main Street believes that the carrying amounts of its financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, payables and other liabilities approximate the fair values of such items due to the short term nature of these instruments. Marketable securities and idle funds investments
may include investments in certificates of deposit, U.S. government agency securities, independently rated debt investments, diversified bond funds and publicly traded debt and equity investments, and
the fair value determination for these investments under the provisions of ASC 820 generally consists of Level 1 and 2 observable inputs, similar in nature to those discussed further in
Note C.   

          As
part of Main Street's acquisition of the majority of the equity interests of MSC II in January 2010 (the "MSC II Acquisition"), Main Street elected the fair value option under ASC
825,    Financial Instruments    ("ASC 825") relating to accounting for debt obligations at their fair value, for the MSC II SBIC debentures acquired (the
"Acquired Debentures") as part of the acquisition accounting related to the MSC II Acquisition and values those obligations as discussed further in Note C. In order to provide for a more
consistent basis of presentation, Main Street has continued to elect the fair value option for SBIC debentures issued by MSC II subsequent to the MSC II Acquisition. When the fair value option is
elected for a given SBIC debenture, the deferred loan costs associated with the debenture are fully expensed in the current period to "Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation
(Depreciation) SBIC debentures" as part of the fair value adjustment. Interest incurred in connection with SBIC debentures which are valued at fair value is included in interest expense.   

   12.   Earnings per Share     

          Basic and diluted per share calculations are computed utilizing the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. In accordance
with ASC 260,    Earnings Per Share   , the unvested shares of restricted stock awarded pursuant to Main Street's equity compensation plans are participating
securities and, therefore, are included in the basic earnings per share calculation. As a result, for all periods presented, there is no difference between diluted earnings per share and basic
earnings per share amounts.   

   13.   Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards     

          In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606)   . ASU 2014-9 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under ASC Topic

  605,
   Revenue Recognition   , and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an
entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. Under the new guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when
(or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital
markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. This ASU clarified guidance on assessing collectability, presenting sales tax,
measuring noncash consideration, and certain transition matters. The FASB tentatively decided to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities under U.S. GAAP for one
year. If finalized, the new guidance will be effective for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption
would be permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Main Street is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have
on its financial statements.   

          In
May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,    Fair Value Measurements Disclosures for Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per
Share   . This amendment updates guidance intended to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how investments measured at net asset value under the practical expedient
with future redemption dates have been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. Under the updated guidance, investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share using the
practical expedient should no longer be categorized in the fair value hierarchy, while investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share but the practical expedient is not
applied should continue to be categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The updated guidance requires retrospective adoption for all periods presented and is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard during the three months ended March 31, 2016. There was no impact of the
adoption of this new accounting standard on Main Street's consolidated financial statements as none of its investments are measured through the use of the practical expedient.   

          In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases   , which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset,
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and
quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which
includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods
therein. Early application is permitted. The impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on Main Street's consolidated financial statements is currently being evaluated.   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new

  guidance
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this standard during
the three months ended March 31, 2016. See further discussion of the impact of the adoption of this standard in Note B.8.   

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   , which is intended to reduce the existing diversity in
practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on Main Street's consolidated financial statements is not expected to be
material.   

          From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by Main Street as of the specified effective date. Main Street
believes that the impact of recently issued standards and any that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial statements upon adoption.   

NOTE C FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR INVESTMENTS AND DEBENTURES PORTFOLIO
COMPOSITION     

          ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs
used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Main Street accounts for its investments at fair value.   

Fair Value Hierarchy     

In accordance with ASC 820, Main Street has categorized its investments based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a
three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical investments (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs (Level 3).   

          Investments
recorded on Main Street's balance sheet are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:   

Level 1 Investments
whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that Main Street has the ability to access (examples
include investments in active exchange-traded equity securities and investments in most U.S. government and agency securities).   

          Level 2 Investments
whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for
substantially the full term of the investment. Level 2 inputs include the following:  

Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets (for example, investments in restricted stock);   
            Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets (for example, investments in thinly traded public companies);    
            Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the investment (for example, market interest rate indices); and    

74  

Table of Contents   

MAIN STREET CAPITAL CORPORATION    

    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)    

    (Unaudited)    

Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data through correlation or other means for
substantially the full term of the investment.    

Level 3 Investments
whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value
measurement (for example, investments in illiquid securities issued by private companies). These inputs reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in
pricing the investment.   

As
required by ASC 820, when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable
(Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). Therefore, unrealized appreciation and depreciation related to such investments categorized within the Level 3 tables below may
include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (Level 3). Main Street conducts reviews of fair value
hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. During the classification process, Main Street may determine that it is appropriate to transfer investments between fair value hierarchy Levels. These
transfers occur when Main Street has concluded that it is appropriate for the classification of an individual asset to be changed due to a change in the factors used to determine the selection of the
Level. Any such changes are deemed to be effective during the quarter in which the transfer occurs.   

          As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of Main Street's LMM portfolio investments except for the debt and equity investments in one portfolio company consisted
of illiquid securities issued by private companies. Those investments which were the exceptions were in a company with publicly traded equity. As a result, the fair value determination for the LMM
portfolio investments primarily consisted of unobservable inputs. The fair value determination for the publicly traded equity security consisted of observable inputs in non-active markets for which
sufficient observable inputs were available to determine the fair value. As a result, all of Main Street's LMM portfolio investments were categorized as Level 3 as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, except for the one publicly traded equity security which was categorized as Level 2.   

          As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Main Street's Middle Market portfolio investments consisted primarily of investments in secured and unsecured debt
investments and independently rated debt investments. The fair value determination for these investments consisted of a combination of observable inputs in non-active markets for which sufficient
observable inputs were not available to determine the fair value of these investments and unobservable inputs. As a result, all of Main Street's Middle Market portfolio investments were categorized as
Level 3 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

          As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Main Street's Private Loan portfolio investments primarily consisted of investments in interest-bearing secured debt
investments. The fair value determination for these investments consisted of a combination of observable inputs in non-active markets for which sufficient observable inputs were not available to
determine the fair value of these investments and unobservable inputs. As a result, all of Main Street's Private Loan portfolio investments were categorized as Level 3 as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

          As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Main Street's Other Portfolio investments consisted of illiquid securities issued by private
companies. The fair value determination for these investments primarily consisted of unobservable inputs. As a result, all of Main Street's Other Portfolio investments were categorized as
Level 3 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

          As
of December 31, 2015, Main Street's Marketable securities and idle funds investments consisted primarily of investments in publicly traded debt and equity investments. The fair
value determination for these investments consisted of a combination of observable inputs in active markets for which sufficient observable inputs were available to determine the fair value of these
investments. As a result, all of Main Street's Marketable securities and idle funds investments were categorized as Level 1 as of December 31, 2015.   

          The
fair value determination of each portfolio investment categorized as Level 3 required one or more of the following unobservable
inputs:  

Financial information obtained from each portfolio company, including unaudited statements of operations and balance sheets for the most recent
period available as compared to budgeted numbers;   
            Current and projected financial condition of the portfolio company;   
            Current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations;   
            Type and amount of collateral, if any, underlying the investment;   
            Current financial ratios (e.g., fixed charge coverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and net debt/EBITDA ratio) applicable to the
investment;   
            Current liquidity of the investment and related financial ratios (e.g., current ratio and quick ratio);    
            Pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company;   
            Projected operating results of the portfolio company;   
            Current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment;   
            Current ability of the portfolio company to raise any additional financing as needed;   
            Changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company;    
            Internal occurrences that may have an impact (both positive and negative) on the operating performance of the portfolio company;    
            Qualitative assessment of key management;   
            Contractual rights, obligations or restrictions associated with the investment; and   
            Other factors deemed relevant.    

The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Main Street's LMM equity securities, which are generally valued through an average of the discounted cash flow
technique and the
market comparable/enterprise value technique (unless one of these approaches is determined to not be appropriate), are (i) EBITDA multiples and (ii) the weighted-average cost of capital

  ("WACC").
Significant increases (decreases) in EBITDA multiple inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. On the contrary, significant increases
(decreases) in WACC inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Main Street's
LMM, Middle Market, Private Loan and Other Portfolio debt securities are (i) risk adjusted discount rates used in the Yield-to-Maturity valuation technique (described in
"Note B.1. Valuation of the Investment Portfolio") and (ii) the percentage of expected principal recovery. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these discount rates in
isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these expected principal recovery percentages in isolation would result in
a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. However, due to the nature of certain investments, fair value measurements may be based on other criteria, such as third-party appraisals of
collateral and fair values as determined by independent third parties, which are not presented in the tables below.   

The
following tables provide a summary of the significant unobservable inputs used to measure the fair value of Main Street's Level 3 portfolio investments as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

  fair
value of these instruments primarily using a Yield-to-Maturity approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows of interest and principal for each SBIC debenture recorded at fair value based on
estimated market interest rates for debt instruments of similar structure, terms, and maturity. Main Street's estimate of the expected repayment date of principal for each SBIC debenture recorded at
fair value is the maturity date of the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Main Street's SBIC debentures recorded at fair value are the estimated
market interest rates used to fair value each debenture using the yield valuation technique described above. Significant increases (decreases) in the Yield-to-Maturity valuation inputs in isolation
would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.

          At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Main Street's investments and SBIC debentures at fair value were categorized as follows in the fair value hierarchy for ASC 820
purposes:   

Investment Portfolio Composition     

          Main Street's LMM portfolio investments primarily consist of secured debt, equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held, LMM
companies based in the United States. Main Street's LMM portfolio companies generally have annual revenues between $10 million and $150 million, and its LMM investments generally range
in size from $5 million to $50 million. The LMM debt investments are typically secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio

  company,
generally bear interest at fixed rates, and generally have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date. In most LMM portfolio investments, Main Street receives
nominally priced equity warrants and/or makes direct equity investments in connection with a debt investment.   

          Main
Street's Middle Market portfolio investments primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest-bearing debt securities in privately held companies based
in the United States that are generally larger in size than the companies included in Main Street's LMM portfolio. Main Street's Middle Market portfolio companies generally have annual revenues
between $150 million and $1.5 billion, and its Middle Market investments generally range in size from $3 million to $15 million. Main Street's Middle Market portfolio debt
investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original
investment date.   

          Main
Street's private loan ("Private Loan") portfolio investments are primarily debt securities in privately held companies which have been originated through strategic relationships
with other investment funds on a collaborative basis, and are often referred to in the debt markets as "club deals." Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and
conditions to investments Main Street holds in its LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Main Street's Private Loan portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second
priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original investment date.   

          Main
Street's other portfolio ("Other Portfolio") investments primarily consist of investments which are not consistent with the typical profiles for LMM, Middle Market and Private Loan
portfolio investments, including investments which may be managed by third parties. In the Other Portfolio, Main Street may incur indirect fees and expenses in connection with investments managed by
third parties, such as investments in other investment companies or private funds. For Other Portfolio investments, Main Street generally receives distributions related to the assets held by the
portfolio company. Those assets are typically expected to be liquidated over a five to ten year period.   

          Main
Street's external asset management business is conducted through its External Investment Manager. The External Investment Manager earns management fees based on the assets of the
funds under management and may earn incentive fees, or a carried interest, based on the performance of the funds managed. Main Street entered into an agreement with the External Investment Manager to
share employees in connection with its asset management business generally, and specifically for its relationship with HMS Income Fund, Inc. ("HMS Income"). Through this agreement, Main Street
shares employees with the External Investment Manager, including their related infrastructure, business relationships, management expertise and capital raising capabilities. In the first quarter of
2014, Main Street began allocating cost to the External Investment Manager pursuant to the sharing agreement. Main Street's total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
are net of the costs allocated to the External Investment Manager of $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Main Street's total expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 are net of the costs allocated to the External Investment Manager of $3.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively.   

          Investment
income, consisting of interest, dividends and fees, can fluctuate dramatically due to various factors, including the level of new investment activity, repayments of debt
investments or sales of equity interests. Investment income in any given year could also be highly concentrated among several portfolio companies. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, Main

did not record investment income from any single portfolio company in excess of 10% of total investment income.   

          The
following tables provide a summary of Main Street's investments in the LMM, Middle Market and Private Loan portfolios as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
(this information excludes the Other Portfolio investments and the External Investment Manager which are discussed further below):   

(a)    At
September 30, 2016, Main Street had equity ownership in approximately 99% of its LMM portfolio companies, and the average fully diluted equity ownership in
those portfolio companies was approximately 36%.
      (b)    The
weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost as of September 30, 2016,
including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on
non-accrual status. Weighted-average annual effective yield is higher than what an investor in shares of Main Street's common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect Main
Street's expenses or any sales load paid by an investor.
      (c)    The
average EBITDA is calculated using a simple average for the LMM portfolio and a weighted average for the Middle Market and Private Loan portfolios. These
calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including five LMM portfolio companies, three Middle Market portfolio companies and three Private Loan portfolio companies, as EBITDA is not a
meaningful valuation metric for Main Street's investments in these portfolio companies.

(a)    At
December 31, 2015, Main Street had equity ownership in approximately 96% of its LMM portfolio companies, and the average fully diluted equity ownership in
those portfolio companies was approximately 36%.
      (b)    The
weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost as of December 31, 2015,
including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on
non-accrual status. Weighted-average annual effective yield is higher than what an investor in shares of Main Street's common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect Main
Street's expenses or any sales load paid by an investor.
      (c)    The
average EBITDA is calculated using a simple average for the LMM portfolio and a weighted average for the Middle Market and Private Loan portfolios. These
calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including five LMM portfolio companies, three Middle Market portfolio companies and six Private Loan portfolio companies as EBITDA is not a meaningful
valuation metric for Main Street's investments in these portfolio companies, and those portfolio companies whose primary purpose is to own real estate.     

As
of September 30, 2016, Main Street had Other Portfolio investments in ten companies, collectively totaling approximately $94.8 million in fair value and approximately
$101.3 million in cost basis and
which comprised 4.9% of Main Street's Investment Portfolio at fair value. As of December 31, 2015, Main Street had Other Portfolio investments in ten companies, collectively totaling
approximately $74.8 million in fair value and approximately $75.2 million in cost basis and which comprised approximately 4.2% of Main Street's Investment Portfolio at fair value.   

          As
discussed further in Note A.1., Main Street holds an investment in the External Investment Manager, a wholly owned subsidiary that is treated as a portfolio investment. As of
September 30, 2016, there was no cost basis in this investment and the investment had a fair value of $30.1 million, which comprised 1.6% of Main Street's Investment Portfolio at fair
value. As of December 31, 2015, there was no cost basis in this investment and the investment had a fair value of $27.3 million, which comprised 1.5% of Main Street's Investment
Portfolio at fair value.

Unconsolidated Significant Subsidiaries     

          In accordance with Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, Main Street must determine which of its unconsolidated controlled
portfolio companies, if any, are considered "significant subsidiaries". In evaluating these unconsolidated controlled portfolio companies, there are three tests utilized to

  determine
if any of Main Street's Control Investments (as defined in Note A, including those unconsolidated controlled portfolio companies in which Main Street does not own greater than 50% of
the voting securities) are considered significant subsidiaries: the investment test, the asset test and the income test. Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, as interpreted by the SEC, requires
Main Street to include separate audited financial statements of an unconsolidated majority-owned subsidiary (Control Investments in which Main Street owns greater than 50% of the voting securities) in
an annual report if any of the three tests exceed 20% of Main Street's total investments at fair value, total assets or total income, respectively. Rule 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X
requires summarized financial information of a Control Investment in an annual report if any of the three tests exceeds 10% of Main Street's annual total amounts and Rule 10-01(b)(1) of
Regulation S-X requires summarized financial information in a quarterly report if any of the three tests exceeds 20% of Main Street's year-to-date total amounts.   

          As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Main Street had no single Control Investment that represented greater than 20% of its total Investment Portfolio at fair
value and no single investment whose total assets represented greater than 20% of its total assets. For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Main Street had no single
Control Investment whose income represented greater than 20% of its total income, except for the External Investment Manager for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The summarized financial information for the External Investment Manager is included in Note D.   

NOTE D EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGER     

          As discussed further in Note A.1., the External Investment Manager provides investment management and other services to External Parties.
The External Investment Manager is accounted for as a portfolio investment of MSCC since the External Investment Manager conducts all of its investment management activities for External Parties.   

During
May 2012, Main Street entered into an investment sub-advisory agreement with HMS Adviser, LP ("HMS Adviser"), which is the investment advisor to HMS Income, a non-publicly
traded BDC, to provide certain investment advisory services to HMS Adviser. In December 2013, after obtaining required no-action relief from the SEC to allow it to own a registered investment adviser,
Main Street assigned the sub-advisory agreement to the External Investment Manager since the fees received from such arrangement could otherwise have negative consequences on MSCC's ability to meet
the source-of-income requirement necessary for it to maintain its RIC tax treatment. Under the investment sub-advisory agreement, the External Investment Manager is entitled to 50% of the base
management fee and the incentive fees earned by HMS Adviser under its advisory agreement with HMS Income. Based upon several fee waiver agreements with HMS Income and HMS Adviser, the External
Investment Manager did not begin accruing the base management fee and incentive fees, if any, until January 1, 2014. The External Investment Manager has conditionally agreed to waive a limited
amount of the incentive fees otherwise earned. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the External Investment Manager earned $2.5 million and $2.1 million,
respectively, of management fees (net of fees waived, if any) under the sub-advisory agreement with HMS Adviser. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the External
Investment Manager earned $7.1 million and $5.5 million, respectively, of management fees (net of fees waived, if any) under the sub-advisory agreement with HMS Adviser.

    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)     

    (Unaudited)     

          The investment in the External Investment Manager is accounted for using fair value accounting, with the fair value determined by Main Street and approved, in
good faith, by Main Street's Board of Directors. Main Street determines the fair value of the External Investment Manager using the Waterfall valuation method under the market approach (see further
discussion in Note B.1.). Any change in fair value of the investment in the External Investment Manager is recognized on Main Street's consolidated statement of operations in "Net Change in
Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) Portfolio investments".   

          The
External Investment Manager has elected, for tax purposes, to be treated as a taxable entity, is not consolidated with Main Street for income tax purposes and is taxed at normal
corporate tax rates based on its taxable income and, as a result of its activities, may generate income tax expense or benefit. The External Investment Manager has elected to be treated as a taxable
entity to enable it to receive fee income and to allow MSCC to continue to comply with the "source-income" requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions of the Code. The taxable income, or loss, of
the External Investment Manager may differ from its book income, or loss, due to temporary book and tax timing differences and permanent differences. The External Investment Manager provides for any
income tax expense, or benefit, and any tax assets or liabilities in its separate financial statements.   

          Main
Street shares employees with the External Investment Manager and allocates costs related to such shared employees to the External Investment Manager generally based on a combination
of the direct time spent, new investment origination activity and assets under management, depending on the nature of the expense. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Main
Street allocated $1.2 million and $1.1 million of total expenses, respectively, to the External Investment Manager. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Main
Street allocated $3.7 million and $3.1 million of total expenses, respectively, to the External Investment Manager. The total contribution of the External Investment Manager to Main
Street's net investment income consists of the combination of the expenses allocated to the External Investment Manager and dividend income from the External Investment Manager. For the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total contribution to net investment income was $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the total contribution to net investment income was $5.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively.

          Summarized
financial information from the separate financial statements of the External Investment Manager as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:   

NOTE E SBIC DEBENTURES     

          SBIC debentures payable were $231.0 million and $225.0 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. SBIC debentures provide for interest to be paid semi-annually, with principal due at the applicable 10-year maturity date of each debenture. In August 2016, Main Street received a
license from the SBA to operate a third SBIC, which at the time provided Main Street with up to $125.0 million of additional long-term, fixed interest rate debt capital through the issuance of
SBA-guaranteed debentures. During September 2016, Main Street issued $6.0 million of SBIC debentures, leaving $119.0 million of additional capacity. The weighted-average annual interest
rate on the SBIC debentures was 4.1% as of September 30, 2016 and 4.2% as of December 31, 2015. The first principal maturity due under the existing SBIC debentures is in 2017, and the
weighted-average remaining duration as of September 30, 2016 was approximately 5.0 years. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Main Street recognized interest
expense attributable to the SBIC debentures of $2.5 million in each period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,

  Main
Street recognized interest expense attributable to the SBIC debentures of $7.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Main Street has incurred upfront leverage and other
miscellaneous fees of approximately 3.4% of the debenture principal amount. In accordance with SBA regulations, the Funds are precluded from incurring additional non-SBIC debt without the prior
approval of the SBA. The Funds are subject to annual compliance examinations by the SBA. There have been no historical findings resulting from these examinations.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, the recorded value of the SBIC debentures was $230.5 million which consisted of (i) $74.7 million recorded at fair value, or
$0.5 million less than the $75.2 million par value of the SBIC debentures issued in MSC II (ii) $149.8 million recorded at par value and held in MSMF and
(iii) $6.0 million recorded at par value and held in MSC III. As of September 30, 2016, if Main Street had adopted the fair value option under ASC 825 for all of its SBIC
debentures, Main Street estimates the fair value of its SBIC debentures would be approximately $223.8 million, or $7.2 million less than the $231.0 million face value of the SBIC
debentures.   

NOTE F CREDIT FACILITY     

          Main Street maintains the Credit Facility to provide additional liquidity to support its investment and operational activities. The Credit
Facility includes total commitments of $555.0 million from a diversified group of fourteen lenders and matures in September 2020. The Credit Facility also contains an accordion feature which
allows Main Street to increase the total commitments under the facility to up to $750.0 million from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments.   

          Borrowings
under the Credit Facility bear interest, subject to Main Street's election, on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate (0.53% as of September 30,
2016) plus (i) 1.875% (or the applicable base rate (Prime Rate of 3.50% as of September 30, 2016) plus 0.875%) as long as Main Street maintains an investment grade rating and meets
certain agreed upon excess collateral and maximum leverage requirements, (ii) 2.0% (or the applicable base rate plus 1.0%) if Main Street maintains an investment grade rating but, does not meet
certain excess collateral and maximum leverage requirements or (iii) 2.25% (or the applicable base rate plus 1.25%) if Main Street does not maintain an investment grade rating. Main Street pays
unused commitment fees of 0.25% per annum on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is secured by a first lien on the assets of MSCC and its subsidiaries,
excluding the equity ownership or assets of the Funds and the External Investment Manager. The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative
covenants, including but not limited to: (i) maintaining a minimum availability of at least 10% of the borrowing base, (ii) maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0,
(iii) maintaining an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.0 and (iv) maintaining a minimum tangible net worth. The Credit Facility is provided on a revolving basis through its final
maturity date in September 2020, and contains two, one-year extension options which could extend the final maturity by up to two years, subject to certain conditions, including lender approval.   

          At
September 30, 2016, Main Street had $313.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, if Main Street had adopted the
fair value option under ASC 825 for its Credit Facility, Main Street estimates its fair value would approximate its recorded value. Main Street recognized interest expense related to the Credit
Facility, including unused commitment fees and amortization of deferred loan costs, of $2.5 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $6.7 million and $5.5 million for the nine month

  periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the interest rate on the Credit Facility was 2.4%. The average interest rate was 2.4% and 2.3% for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, Main Street was in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit Facility.   

NOTE G NOTES     

6.125% Notes     

In April 2013, Main Street issued $92.0 million, including the underwriters full exercise of their option to purchase additional
principal amounts to cover over-allotments, in aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Notes due 2023 (the "6.125% Notes"). The 6.125% Notes are unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with Main
Street's current and future unsecured indebtedness; senior to any of its future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 6.125% Notes; effectively subordinated to all of its
existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such indebtedness, including borrowings under its Credit Facility; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of its
subsidiaries, including without limitation, the indebtedness of the Funds. The 6.125% Notes mature on April 1, 2023, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at
Main Street's option on or after April 1, 2018. The 6.125% Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per year payable quarterly on January 1, April 1, July 1 and
October 1 of each year. The total net proceeds to Main Street from the 6.125% Notes, after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by Main Street, were approximately
$89.0 million. Main Street has listed the 6.125% Notes on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "MSCA". Main Street may from time to time repurchase the 6.125% Notes in
accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the 6.125% Notes was $90.7 million. As of September 30,
2016, if Main Street had adopted the fair value option under ASC 825 for the 6.125% Notes, Main Street estimates the fair value would be approximately $94.1 million. Main Street recognized
interest expense related to the 6.125% Notes, including amortization of deferred loan costs, of $1.5 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and
$4.4 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

The
indenture governing the 6.125% Notes (the "6.125% Notes Indenture") contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring Main Street's compliance with (regardless of whether
Main Street is subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring Main Street to
provide financial information to the holders of the 6.125% Notes and the Trustee if Main Street ceases to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
covenants are subject to limitations and exceptions that are described in the 6.125% Notes Indenture. As of September 30, 2016, Main Street was in compliance with these covenants.   

4.50% Notes     

In November 2014, Main Street issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.50% unsecured notes due 2019 (the "4.50% Notes")
at an issue price of 99.53%. The 4.50% Notes are unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with Main Street's current and future unsecured indebtedness; senior to any of its future indebtedness that
expressly provides it is subordinated to the 4.50% Notes; effectively subordinated to all of its existing and future secured indebtedness, to the

  extent
of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including borrowings under its Credit Facility; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other
obligations of
any of its subsidiaries, including without limitation, the indebtedness of the Funds. The 4.50% Notes mature on December 1, 2019, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at Main
Street's option subject to certain make-whole provisions. The 4.50% Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The total
net proceeds from the 4.50% Notes, resulting from the issue price and after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $171.2 million. Main Street
may from time to time repurchase the 4.50% Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the 4.50% Notes was
$175.0 million. As of September 30, 2016, if Main Street had adopted the fair value option under ASC 825 for the 4.50% Notes, Main Street estimates its fair value would be approximately
$179.9 million. Main Street recognized interest expense related to the 4.50% Notes, including amortization of deferred loan costs, of $2.1 million for each of the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $6.4 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

NOTE I DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXABLE INCOME     

          Main Street paid regular monthly dividends of $0.180 per share for each month of January through September 2016, totaling approximately
$28.3 million, or $0.540 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and $83.1 million, or $1.620 per share, for the nine months ended September 30,

  2016.
The third quarter 2016 regular monthly dividends represent a 2.9% increase from the regular monthly dividends paid for the third quarter of 2015. Additionally, Main Street paid a $0.275 per
share supplemental semi-annual dividend, totaling $14.2 million, in June 2016 compared to a $13.7 million, or $0.275 per share, paid in June 2015. The regular monthly dividends equaled a
total of approximately $26.2 million, or $0.525 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and $75.4 million, or $1.560 per share, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.   

          MSCC
has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC. MSCC's taxable income includes the taxable income generated by MSCC and certain of its subsidiaries,
including the Funds, which are treated as disregarded entities for tax purposes. As a RIC, MSCC generally will not pay corporate level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or
capital gains that MSCC distributes to its stockholders. MSCC must generally distribute at least 90% of its "investment company taxable income" (which is generally its net ordinary taxable income and
realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) and 90% of its tax exempt income to maintain its RIC status (pass-through tax treatment for amounts
distributed). As part of maintaining RIC status, undistributed taxable income (subject to a 4% non-deductible U.S Federal excise tax) pertaining to a
given fiscal year may be distributed up to 12 months subsequent to the end of that fiscal year, provided such dividends are declared on or prior to the later of (i) filing of the U.S
federal income tax return for the applicable fiscal year or (ii) the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the year in which such taxable income was generated.   

          The
determination of the tax attributes for Main Street's distributions is made annually, based upon its taxable income for the full year and distributions paid for the full year.
Therefore, a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of distributions for a full year. Ordinary dividend distributions from a RIC do not qualify
for the 20% maximum tax rate (plus a 3.8% Medicare surtax, if applicable) on dividend income from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations, except to the extent that the RIC received
the income in the form of qualifying dividends from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. The tax attributes for distributions will generally include both ordinary income and
capital gains, but may also include qualified dividends or return of capital.

Listed
below is a reconciliation of "Net increase in net assets resulting from operations" to taxable income and to total distributions declared to common stockholders for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

(1)    Main
Street's taxable income for each period is an estimate and will not be finally determined until the company files its tax return for each year. Therefore, the
final taxable income, and the taxable income earned in each period and carried forward for distribution in the following period, may be different than this estimate.     

The
Taxable Subsidiaries hold certain portfolio investments for Main Street. The Taxable Subsidiaries permit Main Street to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are
"pass-through" entities for tax purposes and to continue to comply with the "source-income" requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated with
Main Street for U.S. GAAP financial reporting purposes, and the portfolio investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries are included in Main Street's consolidated financial statements as
portfolio investments and recorded at fair value. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with MSCC for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and
liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The taxable income, or loss, of the Taxable Subsidiaries may differ from its book income, or loss, due to temporary book
and tax timing differences and permanent differences. This income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and the related tax assets and liabilities, are reflected in Main Street's consolidated financial
statements.   

          MSCC's
wholly owned subsidiary MSCP is included in Main Street's consolidated financial statements for financial reporting purposes. For tax purposes, MSCP has elected to be treated as a

  taxable
entity, and therefore is not consolidated with MSCC for income tax purposes and is taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income and, as a result of its activities, may
generate income tax expense or benefit. The taxable income, or loss, of MSCP may differ from its book income, or loss, due to temporary book and tax timing differences and permanent differences. This
income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and the related tax assets and liabilities, are reflected in Main Street's consolidated financial statements.   

          The
income tax expense, or benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, generated by the Taxable Subsidiaries and MSCP, if any, are reflected in Main Street's consolidated
financial statements. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Main Street recognized a net income tax benefit of $0.5 million, principally consisting of a deferred tax benefit of
$1.4 million which is primarily the result of the net activity relating to the portfolio investments held in the Taxable Subsidiaries including changes in the loss carryforwards, changes in net
unrealized appreciation or depreciation and other temporary book-tax differences, partially offset by a $0.9 million current tax expense which is primarily related to a $1.0 million
accrual for excise tax on Main Street's estimated undistributed taxable income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Main Street recognized a net income tax benefit of
$1.0 million, principally consisting of a deferred tax benefit of $3.4 million which is primarily the result of the net
activity relating to the portfolio investments held in the Taxable Subsidiaries including changes in the loss carryforwards, changes in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation and temporary
book-tax differences, partially offset by $2.4 million in current tax expense which is composed of a (i) $2.1 million accrual for excise tax on its estimated undistributed taxable
income and (ii) $0.3 million of accruals for current U.S. federal income and state taxes. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, Main Street recognized a net income tax
benefit of $3.2 million, which principally consisted of a deferred tax benefit of $2.7 million which was primarily the result of the net activity relating to the portfolio investments
held in the Taxable Subsidiaries including changes in the loss carryforwards, changes in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation and other temporary book tax differences and a $0.5 million
benefit for other current taxes, which was primarily related to a $0.7 million benefit for current U.S. federal income and state taxes, partially offset by $0.2 million accrual for
excise tax on its estimated undistributed taxable income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Main Street recognized a net income tax benefit of $7.0 million, which principally
consisted of a deferred tax benefit of $8.5 million primarily the result of the net activity relating to the portfolio investments held in the Taxable Subsidiaries including changes in the loss
carryforwards, changes in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation and temporary book tax differences, partially offset by $1.5 million in other current taxes, which principally consisted of
$0.8 million of accruals for current U.S. federal income and state taxes, and a $0.7 million accrual for excise tax on its estimated undistributed taxable income.   

          The
net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $9.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, primarily related to loss
carryforwards, timing differences in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation and other temporary book-tax differences relating to portfolio investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. In
addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, Main Street recorded a one-time $1.8 million increase to deferred tax assets for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits
associated with share-based compensation due to the early adoption of the new accounting standard ASU 2016-09 (See further discussion in Note B.8.). As of September 30, 2016, the Taxable
Subsidiaries had a capital loss carryforward of $15.6 million. For federal income tax purposes, the capital loss carryforward will expire in taxable years 2020 and 2021. The timing and manner
in which Main Street will utilize any net loss carryforwards in any year, or in total, may be limited in the future under the provisions of the Code.

NOTE J COMMON STOCK     

          During November 2015, Main Street commenced a program with selling agents through which it can sell shares of its common stock by means of
at-the-market offerings from time to time (the "ATM Program"). During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Main Street sold 1,996,793 shares of its common stock at a weighted-average price
of $32.67 per share and raised $65.2 million of gross proceeds under the ATM Program. Net proceeds were $64.3 million after
commissions to the selling agents on shares sold and offering costs. As of September 30, 2016, sales transactions representing 30,804 shares had not settled and are not included in shares
issued and outstanding on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, but are included in the weighted average shares outstanding on the consolidated statement of operations and in the shares used to
calculate net asset value per share. As of September 30, 2016, 362,639 shares were available for sale under the ATM Program.   

          During
November and December 2015, Main Street sold 140,568 shares of its common stock at a weighted-average price of $31.98 per share and raised $4.5 million of gross proceeds
under the ATM Program. Net proceeds were $4.3 million after commissions to the selling agents on shares sold and offering costs.   

          During
March 2015, Main Street completed a follow-on public equity offering of 4,370,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase
570,000 additional shares, resulting in total net proceeds, including exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares and after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated
offering expenses payable by Main Street, of approximately $127.8 million.   

NOTE K DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN ("DRIP")     

          Main Street's DRIP provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder has elected to receive
dividends in cash. As a result, if Main Street declares a cash dividend, the company's stockholders who have not "opted out" of the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their cash dividend
automatically reinvested into additional shares of MSCC common stock. The share requirements of the DRIP may be satisfied through the issuance of shares of common stock or through open market
purchases of common stock. Newly issued shares will be valued based upon the final closing price of MSCC's common stock on the valuation date determined for each dividend by Main Street's Board of
Directors. Shares purchased in the open market to satisfy the DRIP requirements will be valued based upon the average price of the applicable shares purchased, before any associated brokerage or other
costs. Main Street's DRIP is administered by its transfer agent on behalf of Main Street's record holders and participating brokerage firms. Brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries may
decide not to participate in Main Street's DRIP but may provide a similar dividend reinvestment plan for their clients.   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $10.6 million of the total $97.3 million in dividends paid to stockholders represented DRIP participation. During this
period, the DRIP participation requirements were satisfied with the issuance of 339,544 newly issued shares. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, $13.7 million of the total
$89.1 million in dividends paid to stockholders represented DRIP participation. During this period, the DRIP participation requirements were satisfied with the issuance of 444,957 newly issued
shares and with the purchase of 3,131 shares of common
stock in the open market. The shares disclosed above relate only to Main Street's DRIP and exclude any activity related to broker-managed dividend reinvestment plans.

NOTE L SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION     

          Main Street accounts for its share-based compensation plans using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC 718,     Compensation Stock
Compensation   . Accordingly, for restricted stock awards, Main Street measured the grant date fair value based upon the
market price of its common stock on the date of the grant and amortizes the fair value of the awards as share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the
vesting term.   

          Main
Street's Board of Directors approves the issuance of shares of restricted stock to Main Street employees pursuant to the Main Street Capital Corporation 2015 Equity and Incentive
Plan (the "Equity and Incentive Plan"). These shares generally vest over a three-year period from the grant date. The fair value is expensed over the service period, starting on the grant date. The
following table summarizes the restricted stock issuances approved by Main Street's Board of Directors under the Equity and Incentive Plan, net of shares forfeited, if any, and the remaining shares of
restricted stock available for issuance as of September 30, 2016.   

As
of September 30, 2016, the following table summarizes the restricted stock issued to Main Street's non-employee directors and the remaining shares of restricted stock available
for issuance pursuant to the Main Street Capital Corporation 2015 Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Plan. These shares are granted upon appointment or election to the board and vest on the day
immediately preceding the annual meeting of stockholders following the respective grant date and are expensed over such service period.   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Main Street recognized total share-based compensation expense of $2.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively,
related to the restricted stock issued to Main Street employees and non-employee directors, and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Main Street recognized total share-based
compensation expense of $6.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively, related to the restricted stock issued to Main Street employees and non-employee directors.   

As
of September 30, 2016, there was $14.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to Main Street's non-vested restricted shares. This compensation
expense is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 2.0 years as of September 30, 2016.

Street will fund its unfunded commitments from the same sources it uses to fund its investment commitments that are funded at the time they are made (which are typically through
existing cash and cash equivalents, the liquidation of Marketable securities and idle funds investments, and a combination of future debt and equity capital). Main Street follows a process to manage
its liquidity and ensure that it has available capital to fund its unfunded commitments as necessary. The Company had total unrealized depreciation of $0.1 million on the outstanding unfunded
commitments as of September 30, 2016.   

          Main
Street may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of its operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may try to impose
liability on Main Street in connection with the activities of its portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, Main Street
does not expect any current matters will materially affect its financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no
assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on Main Street's financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.

NOTE N RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS     

          As discussed further in Note D, the External Investment Manager is treated as a wholly owned portfolio company of MSCC and is included as
part of Main Street's Investment Portfolio. At September 30, 2016, Main Street had a receivable of approximately $2.2 million due from the External Investment Manager which included
approximately $1.4 million related primarily to operating expenses incurred by MSCC or its subsidiaries required to support the External Investment Manager's business, along with dividends
declared but not paid by the External Investment Manager of approximately $0.8 million.   

          In
November 2015, Main Street's board of directors approved and adopted the Main Street Capital Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2015 Deferred Compensation Plan"). The 2015
Deferred Compensation Plan became effective on January 1, 2016 and replaced the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors previously adopted by the board of directors in June 2013
(the "2013 Deferred Compensation Plan"). Under the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors and certain key employees may defer receipt of some or all of their cash compensation and
directors' fees, subject to certain limitations. Individuals participating in the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan receive distributions of their respective balances based on predetermined payout
schedules or other events as defined by the plan and are also able to direct investments made on their behalf among investment alternatives permitted from time to time under the plan, including
phantom Main Street stock units. As of September 30, 2016, $2.0 million of compensation and directors' fees had been deferred under the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan (including amounts
previously deferred under the 2013 Deferred Compensation Plan). Of this amount, $1.7 million was deferred into phantom Main Street stock units, representing 55,753 shares of Main Street's
common stock. Including phantom stock units issued through dividend reinvestment, the phantom stock units outstanding as of September 30, 2016 represented 63,257 shares of Main Street's common
stock. Any amounts deferred under the plan represented by phantom Main Street stock units will not be issued or included as outstanding on the consolidated statement of changes in net assets until
such shares are actually distributed to the participant in accordance with the plan, but are included in operating expenses and weighted average shares outstanding on Main Street's consolidated
statement of operations as earned.   

NOTE O SUBSEQUENT EVENTS     

          In October 2016, Main Street declared a semi-annual supplemental cash dividend of $0.275 per share payable in December 2016. This supplemental
cash dividend is in addition to the previously announced regular monthly cash dividends that Main Street declared for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.185 per share for each of October, November and
December 2016.   

          In
November 2016, Main Street declared regular monthly dividends of $0.185 per share for each month of January, February and March of 2017. These regular monthly dividends equal a total
of $0.555 per share for the first quarter of 2017 and represent a 2.8% increase from the regular monthly dividends declared for the first quarter of 2016. Including the semi-annual supplemental
dividend declared for December 2016 and the regular monthly dividends declared for the first quarter of 2017, Main Street will have paid $19.160 per share in cumulative dividends since its October
2007 initial public offering.   

          In
October 2016, Main Street amended its Credit Facility to extend the maturity by one year to September 2021. The Credit Facility includes total commitments of $555.0 million
from a diversified group of fourteen lenders and also contains an accordion feature which allows Main Street to increase the total commitments under the facility to up to $750.0 million from
new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments.

The information in this section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see
"Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 26, 2016, for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. You should read the following discussion in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.   

ORGANIZATION     

          Main Street Capital Corporation ("MSCC") is a principal investment firm primarily focused on providing customized debt and equity financing to
lower middle market ("LMM") companies and debt capital to middle market ("Middle Market") companies. The portfolio investments of MSCC and its consolidated subsidiaries are typically made to support
management buyouts, recapitalizations, growth financings, refinancings and acquisitions of companies that operate in diverse industry sectors. MSCC seeks to partner with entrepreneurs, business owners
and management teams and generally provides "one stop" financing alternatives within its LMM portfolio. MSCC and its consolidated subsidiaries invest primarily in secured debt investments, equity
investments, warrants and other securities of LMM companies based in the United States and in secured debt investments of Middle Market companies generally headquartered in the United States.   

          MSCC
was formed in March 2007 to operate as an internally managed business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). MSCC wholly
owns several investment funds, including Main Street Mezzanine Fund, LP ("MSMF"), Main Street Capital II, LP ("MSC II") and Main Street Capital III, LP ("MSC III" and,
collectively with MSMF and MSC II, the "Funds"), and each of their general partners. The Funds are each licensed as a Small Business Investment Company ("SBIC") by the United States Small Business
Administration ("SBA"). Because MSCC is internally managed, all of the executive officers and other employees are employed by MSCC. Therefore, MSCC does not pay any external investment advisory fees
but instead directly incurs the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals.   

          MSC
Adviser I, LLC (the "External Investment Manager") was formed in November 2013 as a wholly owned subsidiary of MSCC to provide investment management and other services to
parties other than MSCC and its subsidiaries or their portfolio companies ("External Parties") and receive fee income for such services. MSCC has been granted no-action relief by the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") to allow the External Investment Manager to register as a registered investment adviser ("RIA") under Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act").
Since the External Investment Manager conducts all of its investment management activities for External Parties, it is accounted for as a portfolio investment of MSCC and is not included as a
consolidated subsidiary of MSCC in MSCC's consolidated financial statements.   

          MSCC
has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"). As a result, MSCC generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes to its stockholders.   

MSCC
has certain direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that have elected to be taxable entities (the "Taxable Subsidiaries"). The primary purpose of the Taxable Subsidiaries is
to permit MSCC to
hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are "pass-through" entities for tax purposes. The External Investment Manager is also a direct wholly owned subsidiary that has elected to   

  109  

Table of Contents   

  be
a taxable entity. The Taxable Subsidiaries and the External Investment Manager are each taxed at their normal corporate tax rates based on their taxable income.   

          Unless
otherwise noted or the context otherwise indicates, the terms "we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Main Street" refer to MSCC and its consolidated subsidiaries, which include the
Funds and the Taxable Subsidiaries.   

OVERVIEW     

          Our principal investment objective is to maximize our portfolio's total return by generating current income from our debt investments and
capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments, including warrants, convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities in a portfolio company. Our LMM companies
generally have annual revenues between $10 million and $150 million, and our LMM portfolio investments generally range in size from $5 million to $50 million. Our Middle
Market investments are made in businesses that are generally larger in size than our LMM portfolio companies, with annual revenues typically between $150 million and $1.5 billion, and
our Middle Market investments generally range in size from $3 million to $15 million. Our private loan ("Private Loan") portfolio investments are primarily debt securities in privately
held companies which have been originated through strategic relationships with other investment funds on a collaborative basis. Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms
and conditions to investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio.   

          We
seek to fill the financing gap for LMM businesses, which, historically, have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources. The underserved
nature of the LMM creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of LMM companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations. Our ability to invest across
a company's capital structure, from secured loans to equity securities, allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing options, or a "one stop" financing solution. Providing
customized, "one stop" financing solutions is important to LMM portfolio companies. We generally seek to partner directly with entrepreneurs, management teams and business owners in making our
investments. Our LMM portfolio debt investments are generally secured by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between five and seven years from the original
investment date.   

          Our
Middle Market portfolio investments primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in privately held companies that are
generally larger in size than the companies included in our LMM portfolio. Our Middle Market portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of
the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration of between three and seven years from the original investment date.   

          Our
Private Loan portfolio investments are primarily debt securities in privately held companies which have been originated through strategic relationships with other investment funds on
a collaborative basis, and are often referred to in the debt markets as "club deals." Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to investments we hold in
our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our Private Loan portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and
typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original investment date.   

Our
other portfolio ("Other Portfolio") investments primarily consist of investments which are not consistent with the typical profiles for our LMM, Middle Market or Private Loan
portfolio investments, including investments which may be managed by third parties. In our Other Portfolio, we may incur indirect fees and expenses in connection with investments managed by third
parties, such as investments in other investment companies or private funds.   

  110  

Table of Contents   

Our
external asset management business is conducted through the External Investment Manager. The External Investment Manager earns management fees based on the assets of the funds under
management and may earn incentive fees, or a carried interest, based on the performance of the funds managed. We have entered into an agreement with the External Investment Manager to share employees
in connection with its asset management business generally, and specifically for its relationship with HMS Income Fund, Inc. ("HMS Income"). Through this agreement, we share employees with the
External Investment Manager, including their related infrastructure, business relationships, management expertise and capital raising capabilities.   

The
following tables provide a summary of our investments in the LMM, Middle Market and Private Loan portfolios as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (this
information excludes the Other Portfolio investments and the External Investment Manager which are discussed further below):   

(a)    At
September 30, 2016, we had equity ownership in approximately 99% of our LMM portfolio companies, and the average fully diluted equity ownership in those
portfolio companies was approximately 36%.
      (b)    The
weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost as of September 30, 2016,
including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on
non-accrual status. Weighted-average annual effective yield is higher than what an investor in shares of our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect our expenses or any
sales load paid by an investor.
      (c)    The
average EBITDA is calculated using a simple average for the LMM portfolio and a weighted average for the Middle Market and Private Loan portfolios. These
calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including five LMM portfolio companies, three Middle Market portfolio companies and three Private Loan portfolio companies, as EBITDA is not a
meaningful valuation metric for our investments in these portfolio companies.     

111  

Table of Contents   

(a)    At
December 31, 2015, we had equity ownership in approximately 96% of our LMM portfolio companies, and the average fully diluted equity ownership in those
portfolio companies was approximately 36%.
      (b)    The
weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost as of December 31, 2015,
including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on
non-accrual status. Weighted-average annual effective yield is higher than what an investor in shares of our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect our expenses or any
sales load paid by an investor.
      (c)    The
average EBITDA is calculated using a simple average for the LMM portfolio and a weighted average for the Middle Market and Private Loan portfolios. These
calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including five LMM portfolio companies, three Middle Market portfolio companies and six Private Loan portfolio companies, as EBITDA is not a
meaningful valuation metric for our investments in these portfolio companies, and those portfolio companies whose primary purpose is to own real estate.     

As
of September 30, 2016, we had Other Portfolio investments in ten companies, collectively totaling approximately $94.8 million in fair value and approximately
$101.3 million in cost basis and which comprised 4.9% of our Investment Portfolio (as defined in " Critical Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation" below) at fair
value. As of December 31, 2015, we had Other Portfolio investments in ten companies, collectively totaling approximately $74.8 million in fair value and approximately
$75.2 million in cost basis and which comprised approximately 4.2% of our Investment Portfolio at fair value.   

          As
previously discussed, the External Investment Manager is a wholly owned subsidiary that is treated as a portfolio investment. As of September 30, 2016, there was no cost basis
in this investment and the investment had a fair value of $30.1 million, which comprised 1.6% of our Investment Portfolio at fair value. As of December 31, 2015, there was no cost basis
in this investment and the investment had a fair value of $27.3 million, which comprised 1.5% of our Investment Portfolio at fair value.   

Our
portfolio investments are generally made through MSCC and the Funds. MSCC and the Funds share the same investment strategies and criteria, although they are subject to different
regulatory regimes. An investor's return in MSCC will depend, in part, on the Funds' investment returns as they are wholly owned subsidiaries of MSCC.   

          The
level of new portfolio investment activity will fluctuate from period to period based upon our view of the current economic fundamentals, our ability to identify new investment
opportunities that   

  112  

Table of Contents   

  meet
our investment criteria, and our ability to consummate the identified opportunities. The level of new investment activity, and associated interest and fee income, will directly impact future
investment income. In addition, the level of dividends paid by portfolio companies and the portion of our portfolio debt investments on non-accrual status will directly impact future investment
income. While we intend to grow our portfolio and our investment income over the long term, our growth and our operating results may be more limited during depressed economic periods. However, we
intend to appropriately manage our cost structure and liquidity position based on applicable economic conditions and our investment outlook. The level of realized gains or losses and unrealized
appreciation or depreciation on our investments will also fluctuate depending upon portfolio activity, economic conditions and the
performance of our individual portfolio companies. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results.   

          Because
we are internally managed, we do not pay any external investment advisory fees, but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio
management professionals. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held
investment firms which are externally managed, and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our Investment Portfolio. For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the ratio of our total operating expenses, excluding interest expense, as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was 1.5% on an annualized
basis, compared to 1.3% on an annualized basis for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the ratio of our total operating expenses,
excluding interest expense, as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was 1.4% on an annualized basis, which is consistent with the ratio on an annualized basis for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

          During
May 2012, we entered into an investment sub-advisory agreement with HMS Adviser, LP ("HMS Adviser"), which is the investment advisor to HMS Income, a non-publicly traded
BDC, to provide certain investment advisory services to HMS Adviser. In December 2013, after obtaining required no-action relief from the SEC to allow us to own a registered investment adviser, we
assigned the sub-advisory agreement to the External Investment Manager since the fees received from such arrangement could otherwise have negative consequences on our ability to meet the
source-of-income requirement necessary for us to maintain our RIC tax treatment. Under the investment sub-advisory agreement, the External Investment Manager is entitled to 50% of the base management
fee and the incentive fees earned by HMS Adviser under its advisory agreement with HMS Income. Based upon several fee waiver agreements with HMS Income and HMS Adviser, the External Investment Manager
did not begin accruing the base management fee and incentive fees, if any, until January 1, 2014. The External Investment Manager has conditionally agreed to waive a limited amount of the
incentive fees otherwise earned. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the External Investment Manager earned $2.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of
management fees (net of fees waived, if any) under the sub-advisory agreement with HMS Adviser. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the External Investment Manager earned
$7.1 million and $5.5 million, respectively, of management fees (net of fees waived, if any) under the sub-advisory agreement with HMS Adviser.   

During
April 2014, we received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting co-investments by us and HMS Income in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be
prohibited under the 1940 Act. We have made, and in the future intend to continue to make, such co-investments with HMS Income in accordance with the conditions of the order. The order requires, among
other things, that we and the External Investment Manager consider whether each such investment opportunity is appropriate for HMS Income and, if it is appropriate, to propose an allocation of the
investment opportunity between us and HMS Income. Because the External Investment Manager may   

  113  

Table of Contents   

  receive
performance-based fee compensation from HMS Income, this may provide it an incentive to allocate opportunities to HMS Income instead of us. However, both we and the External Investment Manager
have policies and procedures in place to manage this conflict.   

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES     

Basis of Presentation      

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP"). For each of the periods presented herein, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MSCC and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Investment Portfolio, as used
herein, refers to all of our investments in LMM portfolio companies, investments in Middle Market portfolio companies, Private Loan portfolio investments, Other Portfolio investments, and the
investment in the External Investment Manager, but excludes all "Marketable securities and idle funds investments". "Marketable securities and idle funds investments" are classified as financial
instruments and are reported separately on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated schedules of investments due to the nature of such investments. Our results of operations for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and financial position as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, are presented on a consolidated basis. The effects of all intercompany transactions between us and our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.   

Our
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for
reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are
omitted. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial results included herein contain all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for
the fair presentation of financial statements for the interim periods included herein. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Also, the unaudited financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and notes thereto for the year ended December 31,
2015. Financial statements prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.   

          Under
regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X applicable to BDCs and Accounting Standards Codification ("Codification" or "ASC") 946,     Financial Services Investment Companies   
("ASC 946"), we are precluded from consolidating other entities in which we have equity
investments, including those in which we have a controlling interest, unless the other entity is another investment company. An exception to this general principle in ASC 946 occurs if we hold a
controlling interest in an operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to us or to any of our portfolio companies. Accordingly, as noted above, our consolidated
financial statements include the financial position and operating results for the Funds and the Taxable Subsidiaries. Our consolidated financial statements also include the financial position and
operating results for our wholly owned operating subsidiary, Main Street Capital Partners, LLC, ("MSCP"), as the wholly owned subsidiary provides all of its services directly or indirectly to
Main Street or our portfolio companies. We have determined that all of our portfolio investments do not qualify for this exception, including the investment in the External Investment Manager.
Therefore, our Investment Portfolio is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with any adjustments to fair value recognized as "Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)"
on the consolidated statements of operations until the

investment
is realized, usually upon exit, resulting in any gain or loss being recognized as a "Net Realized Gain (Loss)."   

Investment Portfolio Valuation      

The most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our Investment
Portfolio and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our Investment Portfolio valued at fair value
represented approximately 96% of our total assets. We are required to report our investments at fair value. We follow the provisions of FASB ASC 820,    Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures    ("ASC 820"). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs
used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to
independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers
in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact. See "Note B.1. Valuation of the Investment Portfolio" in the notes to consolidated
financial statements for a detailed discussion of our investment portfolio valuation process and procedures.   

Due
to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our determination of fair value for our Investment Portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been
determined had a ready market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the
investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual
investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.   

          Our
Board of Directors has the final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value for our Investment Portfolio and our
valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. We believe our Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximates fair value as of those dates
based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.   

Revenue Recognition      

Interest and Dividend Income     

We record interest and dividend income on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded as
dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. In accordance with our valuation policies, we evaluate accrued
interest and dividend income periodically for collectability. When a loan or debt security becomes 90 days or more past due, and if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service
all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally place the loan or debt security on non-accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has
demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a loan or debt security's status significantly improves regarding the debtor's ability to service the debt or other obligations,
or if a loan or debt security is fully impaired, sold or written off, we remove it from non-accrual status.   

Fee Income     

We may periodically provide services, including structuring and advisory services, to our portfolio companies or other third parties. For
services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value, fee income is recognized as earned, which is generally when the investment or   

  115  

Table of Contents   

  other
applicable transaction closes. Fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are deferred and
accreted into interest income over the life of the financing.   

Payment-in-Kind ("PIK") Interest and Cumulative Dividends     

We hold certain debt and preferred equity instruments in our Investment Portfolio that contain PIK interest and cumulative dividend provisions.
The PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual
collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. Cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income, and any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of
the preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed or sold. To maintain RIC tax treatment (as
discussed below), these non-cash sources of income may need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions, even though we may not have collected the PIK interest and cumulative dividends
in cash. We stop accruing PIK interest and cumulative dividends and write off any accrued and uncollected interest and dividends in arrears when we determine that such PIK interest and dividends in
arrears are no longer collectible. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, (i) approximately 4.0% and 2.2%, respectively, of our total investment income was attributable
to PIK interest income not paid currently in cash and (ii) approximately 1.8% and 1.2%, respectively, of our total investment income was attributable to cumulative dividend income not paid
currently in cash. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, (i) approximately 3.7% and 2.1%, respectively, of our total investment income was attributable to PIK interest
income not paid currently in cash and (ii) approximately 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively, of our total investment income was attributable to cumulative dividend income not paid currently in cash.   

Share-Based Compensation      

We account for our share-based compensation plans using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC 718,     Compensation Stock Compensation   . Accordingly, for restricted stock awards, we measure the grant date fair value based upon the market price
of our common stock on the date of the grant and amortize the fair value of the awards as share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term.   

Income Taxes      

MSCC has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC. MSCC's taxable income includes the taxable income generated by
MSCC and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Funds, which are treated as disregarded entities for tax purposes. As a RIC, MSCC generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income
taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that MSCC distributes to its stockholders. MSCC must generally distribute at least 90% of its "investment company taxable income" (which is generally
its net ordinary taxable income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) and 90% of its tax exempt income to maintain its RIC status (pass-through
tax treatment for amounts distributed). As part of maintaining RIC status, undistributed taxable income (subject to a 4% non-deductible U.S Federal excise tax) pertaining to a given fiscal year may be
distributed up to 12 months subsequent to the end of that fiscal year, provided such dividends are declared on or prior to the later of (i) filing of the U.S federal income tax return
for the applicable fiscal year or (ii) the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the year in which such taxable income was generated.   

The
Taxable Subsidiaries hold certain portfolio investments for us. The Taxable Subsidiaries permit us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are "pass-through" entities
for tax purposes and to continue to comply with the "source-income" requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions   

  116  

Table of Contents   

  of
the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated with us for U.S. GAAP financial reporting purposes, and the portfolio investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries are included in our
consolidated financial statements as portfolio investments and recorded at fair value. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with MSCC for income tax purposes and may generate income tax
expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The taxable income, or loss, of the Taxable Subsidiaries may differ from their
book income, or loss, due to temporary book and tax timing differences and permanent differences. This income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and the related tax assets and liabilities, are reflected
in our consolidated financial statements.   

          MSCP
is included in our consolidated financial statements for financial reporting purposes. For tax purposes, MSCP has elected to be treated as a taxable entity, and therefore is not
consolidated with MSCC for income tax purposes and is taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income and, as a result of its activities, may generate income tax expense or benefit.
The taxable income, or loss, of MSCP may differ from its book income, or loss, due to temporary book and tax timing differences and permanent differences. This income tax expense, or benefit, if any,
and the related tax assets and liabilities, are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.   

          The
Taxable Subsidiaries and MSCP use the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.   

          Taxable
income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses. Taxable income
generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.   

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION     

          Our LMM portfolio investments primarily consist of secured debt, equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held, LMM companies
based in the United States. Our LMM portfolio companies generally have annual revenues between $10 million and $150 million, and our LMM investments generally range in size from
$5 million to $50 million. The LMM debt investments are typically secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company, generally bear interest at
fixed rates, and generally have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date. In most LMM portfolio companies, we receive nominally priced equity warrants and/or make
direct equity investments in connection with a debt investment.   

          Our
Middle Market portfolio investments primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest-bearing debt securities in privately held companies based in the
United States that are generally larger in size than the companies included in our LMM portfolio. Our Middle Market portfolio companies generally have annual revenues between $150 million and
$1.5 billion, and our Middle Market investments generally range in size from $3 million to $15 million. Our Middle Market portfolio debt investments are generally secured by
either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original investment date.   

  117  

Table of Contents    

          Our Private Loan portfolio investments are primarily debt securities in privately held companies which have been originated through strategic relationships with
other investment funds on a collaborative basis, and are often referred to in the debt markets as "club deals." Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions
to investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our Private Loan portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of
the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original investment date.   

          Our
Other Portfolio investments primarily consist of investments which are not consistent with the typical profiles for LMM, Middle Market and Private Loan portfolio investments,
including investments which may be managed by third parties. In the Other Portfolio, we may incur indirect fees and expenses in connection with investments managed by third parties, such as
investments in other investment companies or private funds.   

          Our
external asset management business is conducted through the External Investment Manager. The External Investment Manager earns management fees based on the assets of the funds under
management and may earn incentive fees, or a carried interest, based on the performance of the funds
managed. We have entered into an agreement with the External Investment Manager to share employees in connection with its asset management business generally, and specifically for its relationship
with HMS Income. Through this agreement, we share employees with the External Investment Manager, including their related infrastructure, business relationships, management expertise and capital
raising capabilities. In the first quarter of 2014, we began allocating costs to the External Investment Manager pursuant to the sharing agreement. Our total expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 are net of expenses allocated to the External Investment Manager of $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Our total expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are net of expenses allocated to the External Investment Manager of $3.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The External Investment Manager
earns management fees based on the assets of the funds under management and may earn incentive fees, or a carried interest, based on the performance of the funds managed. The total contribution of the
External Investment Manager to our net investment income consists of the combination of the expenses allocated to the External Investment Manager and dividend income from the External Investment
Manager. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total contribution to our net investment income was $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total contribution to our net investment income was $5.8 million and $4.7 million, respectively.   

          The
following tables summarize the composition of our total combined LMM portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments and Private Loan portfolio investments at cost and
fair value by type of investment as a percentage of the total combined LMM portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments and Private Loan portfolio investments as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 (this information excludes the Other Portfolio investments and the External Investment Manager).

Our
LMM portfolio investments, Middle Market portfolio investments and Private Loan portfolio investments carry a number of risks including: (1) investing in companies which may
have limited operating histories and financial resources; (2) holding investments that generally are not publicly traded and which may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale; and
(3) other risks common to investing in below investment grade debt and equity investments in our Investment Portfolio. Please see "Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investments"
contained in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and "Risk Factors" below for a more complete discussion of the risks involved with investing in our Investment
Portfolio.   

PORTFOLIO ASSET QUALITY     

          We utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of each LMM portfolio company and to monitor our expected
level of returns on each of our LMM investments in relation to our expectations for the portfolio company. The investment rating system takes into consideration various factors, including each
investment's expected level of returns, the collectability of our debt investments and the ability to receive a return of the invested capital in our equity investments, comparisons to competitors and
other industry participants, the portfolio company's future outlook and other factors that are deemed to be significant to the portfolio company.   

Investment Rating 1 represents a LMM portfolio company that is performing in a manner which significantly exceeds expectations.    
            Investment Rating 2 represents a LMM portfolio company that, in general, is performing above expectations.    
            Investment Rating 3 represents a LMM portfolio company that is generally performing in accordance with expectations.    
            Investment Rating 4 represents a LMM portfolio company that is underperforming expectations. Investments with such a rating require increased
monitoring and scrutiny by us.   
            Investment Rating 5 represents a LMM portfolio company that is significantly underperforming. Investments with such a rating require heightened
levels of monitoring and scrutiny by us and involve the recognition of significant unrealized depreciation on such investment.    

  All
new LMM portfolio investments receive an initial Investment Rating of 3.   

119  

Table of Contents   

The
following table shows the distribution of our LMM portfolio investments on the 1 to 5 investment rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015:   

Based
upon our investment rating system, the weighted-average rating of our LMM portfolio was approximately 2.3 as of September 30, 2016 and 2.2 as of December 31, 2015.   

          As
of September 30, 2016, our total Investment Portfolio had five investments on non-accrual status, which comprised approximately 0.4% of its fair value and 2.8% of its cost. As
of December 31, 2015, our total Investment Portfolio had six investments on non-accrual status, which comprised approximately 0.4% of its fair value and 3.7% of its cost.   

The
operating results of our portfolio companies are impacted by changes in the broader fundamentals of the United States economy. In the event that the United States economy contracts,
it is likely that the financial results of small-to mid-sized companies, like those in which we invest, could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels, which could ultimately
lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and to an increase in defaults on our debt investments and to difficulty in maintaining historical dividend payment rates on our equity
investments. Consequently, we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic cycles or other conditions, which could also have
a negative impact on our future results.   

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015      

120  

Table of Contents   

(a)    Distributable
net investment income is net investment income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the impact of share-based compensation
expense which is non-cash in nature. We believe presenting distributable net investment income and related per share amounts is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure of information for
analyzing our financial performance since share-based compensation does not require settlement in cash. However, distributable net investment income is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be
considered as a replacement to net investment income and other earnings measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, distributable net investment income should be reviewed only in
connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing our financial performance. A reconciliation of net investment income in accordance with U.S. GAAP to distributable net investment
income is presented in the table above.     

Investment Income     

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total investment income was $46.6 million, a 9% increase over the
$42.6 million of total investment income for the corresponding period of 2015. This comparable period increase was principally attributable to (i) a $1.4 million increase in
interest income primarily related to higher average levels of portfolio debt investments and (ii) a $2.8 million increase in dividend income from Investment Portfolio equity investments.
The $4.0 million increase in total investment income in the three months ended September 30, 2016 includes the impact of an increase of $0.3 million primarily related to higher
accelerated prepayment and repricing activity for certain Investment Portfolio debt investments when compared to the same period in 2015 and an increase of $1.7 million related to dividend
income activity from portfolio companies that is considered to be less consistent on a recurring basis or non-recurring during the period when compared to the same period in 2015.   

Expenses     

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total expenses increased to $16.0 million from $14.7 million for the
corresponding period of 2015. This comparable period increase in operating expenses was principally attributable to (i) a $0.6 million increase in compensation expense related to
increases in the number of personnel, base compensation levels and incentive compensation accruals, (ii) a $0.5 million increase in share-based compensation expense and (iii) a
$0.3 million increase in interest expense, primarily due to an increase in interest expense on the Credit Facility in the three months ended September 30, 2016, with these increases
partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in the expenses allocated to the External Investment Manager (see further discussion in "Overview"), in each case when compared to the same period in
the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the ratio of our total operating expenses, excluding interest expense, as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was
1.5% on an annualized basis, compared to 1.3% on an annualized basis for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Net Investment Income     

Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $30.6 million, or a 10% increase, compared to net
investment income of $27.9 million for the corresponding period of 2015. The increase in net investment income was principally attributable to the increase in total investment income, partially
offset by higher operating expenses as discussed above.   

Distributable Net Investment Income     

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, distributable net investment income increased 11% to $32.7 million, or $0.62 per
share, compared with $29.5 million, or $0.59 per share, in the corresponding period of 2015. The increase in distributable net investment income was primarily due to the higher level of total
investment income, partially offset by higher operating expenses as discussed above. Distributable net investment income on a per share basis for the three months ended September 30, 2016
reflects (i) an increase of approximately $0.01 per share from the comparable period in 2015 attributable to the net increase in the comparable levels of accelerated prepayment and repricing
activity for certain Investment Portfolio debt investments, (ii) an increase of approximately $0.03 per share from the comparable period in 2015 attributable to the increase in dividend income
that is considered to be less consistent on a recurring basis or non-recurring and (iii) a greater number of average shares outstanding compared to the corresponding period in 2015 primarily
due to shares issued through the ATM Program (as defined in " Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources" below) and shares issued pursuant to our restricted stock plan
and dividend reinvestment plan.   

Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations     

The net increase in net assets resulting from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $43.2 million, or
$0.82 per share, compared with $20.7 million, or $0.41 per share, during the three months ended September 30, 2015. This $22.5 million increase from the same period in the prior
year period was primarily the result of (i) a $16.9 million increase in net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from net unrealized depreciation of $9.1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015 to net unrealized appreciation of $7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, (ii) a $5.6 million increase
in the net realized gain (loss) from investments from a net realized loss of $1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015 to a net realized gain of $4.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and (iii) a $2.7 million
increase in net investment income as discussed above, partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in the income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The net
realized gain of $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the result of (i) the net realized gain on the exit of three LMM investments totaling
$13.2 million and (ii) the net realized gain of $1.2 million due to activity in our Other Portfolio, partially offset by (i) the realized loss of $7.3 million on the
exit of a Private Loan investment and (ii) the realized loss of $2.6 million related to the restructuring of a Middle Market investment.

result of the net activity relating to our portfolio investments held in our Taxable Subsidiaries, including changes in loss carryforwards, changes in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation and
other temporary book-tax differences, partially offset by $0.9 million of other current tax expense primarily related to an accrual for excise tax on our estimated undistributed taxable income.

income is presented in the table above.     

Investment Income     

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total investment income was $131.5 million, a 9% increase over the
$121.1 million of total investment income for the corresponding period of 2015. This comparable period increase was principally attributable to (i) a $4.2 million increase in
interest income primarily related to higher average levels of portfolio debt investments and (ii) a $7.7 million increase in dividend income from Investment Portfolio equity investments,
partially offset by (i) a $0.8 million decrease in fee income and (ii) a $0.7 million decrease in investment income from Marketable securities and idle funds investments.
The $10.4 million increase in total investment income in the nine

  months
ended September 30, 2016 includes an increase of $1.7 million related to dividend income activity from portfolio companies that is considered to be less consistent on a recurring
basis or non-recurring during the period when compared to the same period in 2015 and the impact of a decrease of $0.9 million primarily related to lower accelerated prepayment and repricing
activity for certain Investment Portfolio debt investments when compared to the same period in 2015.   

Expenses     

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total expenses increased to $46.1 million from $42.5 million for the
corresponding period of 2015. This comparable period increase in operating expenses was principally attributable to (i) a $1.4 million increase in share-based compensation expense,
(ii) a $1.3 million increase in interest expense, primarily due to an increase in interest expense on the Credit Facility generally due to the higher average balance outstanding in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, (iii) a $1.0 million increase in compensation expense related to increases in the number of personnel, base compensation levels and incentive
compensation accruals and (iv) a $0.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses, with these increases partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in the expenses
allocated to the External Investment Manager, in each case when compared to the same period in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the ratio of our total operating
expenses, excluding interest expense, as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was 1.4% on an annualized basis, which is consistent with the ratio on an annualized basis for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

Net Investment Income     

Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $85.4 million, or a 9% increase, compared to net investment
income of $78.6 million for the corresponding period of 2015. The increase in net investment income was principally attributable to the increase in total investment income, partially offset by
higher operating expenses as discussed above.   

Distributable Net Investment Income     

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, distributable net investment income increased 10% to $91.3 million, or $1.77 per
share, compared with $83.1 million, or $1.71 per share, in the corresponding period of 2015. The increase in distributable net investment income was primarily due to the higher level of total
investment income, partially offset by higher operating expenses both as discussed above. Distributable net investment income on a per share basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
reflects (i) a decrease of approximately $0.02 per share from the comparable period in 2015 attributable to the net decrease in the comparable levels of accelerated prepayment and repricing
activity for certain Investment Portfolio debt investments, (ii) an increase of approximately $0.03 per share from the comparable period in 2015 attributable to the increase in dividend income
that is considered to be less consistent on a recurring basis or non-recurring and (iii) a greater number of average shares outstanding compared to the corresponding period in 2015 primarily
due to the March 2015 equity offering, shares issued through the ATM Program and shares issued pursuant to our restricted stock plan and dividend reinvestment plan.   

Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations     

The net increase in net assets resulting from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $90.9 million, or
$1.76 per share, compared with $96.9 million, or $1.99 per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This $6.0 million decrease from the same period in the prior
year period was primarily the result of (i) a $49.2 million decrease in net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from net unrealized appreciation of $20.4 million for
the nine   

  125  

Table of Contents   

  months
ended September 30, 2015 to net unrealized depreciation of $28.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and (ii) a $6.0 million decrease in the
income tax benefit from the same period in the prior year, partially offset by (i) a $6.8 million increase in net investment income as discussed above and (ii) a
$42.4 million increase in the net realized gain (loss) from investments from a net realized loss of $9.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to a net realized
gain of $33.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The net realized gain of $33.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily the
result of (i) the net realized gain of $56.3 million on the exit five LMM investments and (ii) the net realized gain of $2.8 million due to activity in our Other Portfolio,
partially offset by (i) the net realized loss of $9.6 million on the exit of three Private Loan investments, (ii) the net realized loss of $10.0 million related to the
restructuring of
three Middle Market investments, (iii) the net realized loss of $4.7 million on the exit of two Middle Market investments and (iv) the net realized loss of $1.6 million on
the exit of a Marketable securities and idle funds investment.

The
income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1.0 million principally consisted of a deferred tax benefit of $3.4 million, which is
primarily the result of the net activity relating to our portfolio investments held in our Taxable Subsidiaries, including changes in loss carryforwards, changes in net unrealized
appreciation/depreciation and other temporary book-tax differences, partially offset by other current tax expense related to (i) a $2.1 million accrual for excise   

  126

  tax
on our estimated undistributed taxable income and (ii) other current tax expense of $0.3 million related to accruals for U.S. federal and state income taxes.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources      

Cash Flows     

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of
$11.5 million, which is the result of $9.4 million of cash provided by our operating activities and $2.0 million of cash provided by financing activities.   

During
the period, we generated $9.4 million of cash from our operating activities, which resulted primarily from (i) cash flows we generated from the operating profits
earned through our operating activities totaling $79.7 million, which is our $91.3 million of distributable net investment income, excluding the non-cash effects of the accretion of
unearned income of $7.1 million, payment-in-kind interest income of $4.9 million, cumulative dividends of $1.5 million and the amortization expense for deferred financing costs of
$1.9 million, (ii) cash uses totaling $423.5 million which primarily resulted from (a) the funding of new portfolio company investments and settlement of accruals for
portfolio investments existing as of December 31, 2015, which collectively total $420.0 million, (b) $3.0 million related to decreases in payables and accruals and
(c) $0.5 million from the purchase of Marketable securities and idle funds investments and (iii) cash proceeds totaling $353.2 million from (a) $347.9 million
in cash proceeds from the sales and repayments of debt investments and sales of and return on capital of equity investments and (b) $4.3 million of cash proceeds from the sale of
Marketable securities and idle funds investments and (c) decreases in other assets of $1.0 million.   

          During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $2.0 million in cash was provided by financing activities, which principally consisted of (i) $64.3 million
in net cash proceeds from the ATM Program (described below), (ii) $22.0 million in net cash proceeds from the Credit Facility and (iii) $6.0 million in cash proceeds from
issuance of SBIC debentures, partially offset by (i) $86.7 million in cash dividends paid to stockholders, (ii) $2.6 million for purchases of vested restricted stock from
employees to satisfy their tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of such restricted stock and (iii) $1.0 million for payment of deferred loan costs, SBIC debenture fees and other
costs.   

Capital Resources     

As of September 30, 2016, we had $31.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $242.0 million of unused capacity under the
Credit Facility, which we maintain to support our investment and operating activities. As of September 30, 2016, our net asset value totaled $1,144.4 million, or $21.62 per share.   

          The
Credit Facility, which provides additional liquidity to support our investment and operational activities, includes total commitments of $555.0 million from a diversified
group of fourteen lenders and matures in September 2020. The Credit Facility also contains an accordion feature which allows us to increase the total commitments under the facility to up to
$750.0 million from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments.   

Borrowings
under the Credit Facility bear interest, subject to our election, on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate (0.53% as of September 30, 2016)
plus (i) 1.875% (or the applicable base rate (Prime Rate of 3.50% as of September 30, 2016) plus 0.875%) as long as we maintain an investment grade rating and meet certain agreed upon
excess collateral and maximum leverage requirements, (ii) 2.0% (or the applicable base rate plus 1.0%) if we maintain an investment grade rating but, do not meet certain excess collateral and
maximum leverage requirements or (iii) 2.25% (or the applicable base rate plus 1.25%) if we do not maintain an investment grade rating. We pay unused commitment fees of 0.25% per annum on the
unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is secured by a first lien on the assets of MSCC and its subsidiaries,   

  127  

Table of Contents   

  excluding
the equity ownership or assets of the Funds and the External Investment Manager. The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to:
(i) maintaining a minimum availability of at least 10% of the borrowing base, (ii) maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0, (iii) maintaining an asset
coverage ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.0 and (iv) maintaining a minimum tangible net worth. The Credit Facility is provided on a revolving basis through its final maturity date in September 2020,
and contains two, one-year extension options which could extend the final maturity by up to two years, subject to certain conditions, including lender approval. As of September 30, 2016, we had
$313.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, the interest rate on the Credit Facility was 2.4% and we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the Credit
Facility.   

          Due
to each of the Funds' status as a licensed SBIC, we have the ability to issue, through the Funds, debentures guaranteed by the SBA at favorable interest rates and favorable terms and
conditions. In addition, in December 2015, the 2016 omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed into law by the President increased the amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that affiliated
SBIC funds can have outstanding from $225.0 million to $350.0 million. This new legislation allows us to issue additional SBIC debentures, subject to SBA approval, above the
$225.0 million that we had outstanding prior to the legislation. In August 2016, we received a license from the SBA to form and operate a third SBIC, which at the time provided us with up to an
additional $125.0 million of additional long-term, fixed interest rate debt capital through the issuance of SBA-guaranteed debentures. During September 2016, we issued $6.0 million of
SBIC debentures, leaving $119.0 million of remaining capacity. Debentures guaranteed by the SBA have fixed interest rates that equal prevailing 10-year Treasury Note rates plus a market spread
and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi-annually. The principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity, but may be pre-paid at any time with no
prepayment penalty. On September 30, 2016, through our three wholly owned SBICs, we had $231.0 million of outstanding SBIC debentures guaranteed by the SBA, which bear a weighted-average
annual fixed interest rate of approximately 4.1%, paid semi-annually, and mature ten years from issuance. The first maturity related to our SBIC debentures does not occur until 2017, and the
weighted-average remaining duration is approximately 5.0 years as of September 30, 2016.   

          In
April 2013, we issued $92.0 million, including the underwriters' full exercise of their over-allotment option, in aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% Notes. The 6.125%
Notes are unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with our current and future unsecured indebtedness; senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the
6.125% Notes; effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including borrowings under our
Credit Facility; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, including without limitation, the indebtedness of the Funds.
The 6.125% Notes mature on April 1, 2023, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after April 1, 2018. We may from time to time
repurchase 6.125% Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the 6.125% Notes was $90.7 million.   

The
indenture governing the 6.125% Notes (the "6.125% Notes Indenture") contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are
subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial
information to the holders of the 6.125% Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These covenants are subject to
limitations and exceptions that are described in the 6.125% Notes Indenture.

          In
November 2014, we issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 4.50% Notes at an issue price of 99.53%. The 4.50% Notes are unsecured obligations and rank pari
passu with our current and future unsecured indebtedness; senior to any of our future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 4.50% Notes; effectively subordinated to all of our
existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including borrowings under our Credit Facility; and structurally subordinated to all
existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our subsidiaries, including without limitation, the indebtedness of the Funds. The 4.50% Notes mature on December 1, 2019, and
may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at our option subject to certain make-whole provisions. The 4.50% Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year payable semi-annually on June 1
and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2015. We may from time to time repurchase 4.50% Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. As of
September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the 4.50% Notes was $175.0 million.   

          The
indenture governing the 4.50% Notes (the "4.50% Notes Indenture") contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring our compliance with (regardless of whether we are subject
to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, as well as covenants requiring us to provide financial information
to the holders of the 4.50% Notes and the Trustee if we cease to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These covenants are subject to limitations and
exceptions that are described in the 4.50% Notes Indenture.   

          During
March 2015, we completed a follow-on public equity offering of 4,370,000 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase 570,000
additional shares, resulting in total net proceeds, including exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares and after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering
expenses payable by us, of approximately $127.8 million.   

          During
November 2015, we commenced a program with selling agents through which we can sell shares of our common stock by means of at-the-market offerings from time to time (the "ATM
Program"). During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we sold 140,568 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $31.98 per share and raised $4.5 million of gross
proceeds under the ATM Program. Net proceeds were $4.3 million after commissions to the selling agents on shares sold and offering costs.   

          During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 1,996,793 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $32.67 per share and raised $65.2 million of
gross proceeds under the ATM Program. Net proceeds were $64.3 million after commissions to the selling agents on shares sold and offering costs. As of September 30, 2016, sales
transactions representing 30,804 shares had not settled and are not included in shares issued and outstanding on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, but are included in the weighted average
shares outstanding on the consolidated statement of operations and in the shares used to calculate our net asset value per share. As of September 30, 2016, 362,639 shares were available for
sale under the ATM Program.   

          We
anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents, the liquidation of Marketable securities and idle funds investments, and
a combination of future issuances of debt and equity capital. Our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies, operating expenses and cash distributions to holders of our common
stock.   

          We
periodically invest excess cash balances into Marketable securities and idle funds investments. The primary investment objective of Marketable securities and idle funds investments is
to generate incremental cash returns on excess cash balances prior to utilizing those funds for investment in our LMM, Middle Market and Private Loan portfolio investments. Marketable securities and
idle funds investments generally consist of debt investments, independently rated debt investments, certificates of   

  129  

Table of Contents   

  deposit
with financial institutions, diversified bond funds and publicly traded debt and equity investments. The composition of Marketable securities and idle funds investments will vary in a given
period based upon, among other things, changes in market conditions, the underlying fundamentals in our Marketable securities and idle funds investments, our outlook regarding future LMM, Middle
Market and Private Loan portfolio investment needs, and any regulatory requirements applicable to us.   

If
our common stock trades below our net asset value per share, we will generally not be able to issue additional common stock at the market price unless our stockholders approve such a
sale and our Board of Directors makes certain determinations. We did not seek stockholder authorization to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our
common stock at our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders because our common stock price per share had been trading significantly above the current net asset value per share of our common stock since
2011. We would therefore need future approval from our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share.   

In
order to satisfy the Code requirements applicable to a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders, after consideration and application of our ability under the Code to carry
forward certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year, substantially all of our taxable income. In addition, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet a
coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities, which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. This requirement limits the amount that we may
borrow. In January 2008, we received an exemptive order from the SEC to exclude SBA guaranteed debt securities issued by MSMF and any other wholly owned subsidiaries of ours which operate as SBICs
from the asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act as applicable to us, which, in turn, enables us to fund more investments with debt capital.   

          Although
we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity, including recent public equity and historical debt offerings, our $555.0 million Credit Facility, and the
available leverage through the SBIC program, there is no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms, or at all.   

Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards      

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   . ASU
2014-9 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under ASC Topic 605,    Revenue Recognition   , and most industry-specific guidance throughout the
Industry Topics of the
ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s)
with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices
across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients   . This ASU clarified guidance on assessing collectability, presenting sales tax, measuring noncash consideration, and certain transition matters. The FASB tentatively
decided to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities under U.S. GAAP for one year. If finalized, the new guidance will be effective for the annual reporting
period beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption would be permitted for annual reporting periods beginning   

  130  

Table of Contents   

  after
December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.   

In
May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,    Fair Value Measurements Disclosures for Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per
Share   . This amendment updates guidance intended to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how investments measured at net asset value under the practical expedient
with future redemption dates have been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. Under the updated guidance, investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share using the
practical expedient should no longer be categorized in the fair value hierarchy, while investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value per share but the practical expedient is not
applied should continue to be categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The updated guidance requires retrospective adoption for all periods presented and is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard during the three months ended March 31, 2016. There was no impact of the
adoption of this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements as none of our investments are measured through the use of the practical expedient.   

          In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases   , which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset,
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and
quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which
includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods
therein.
Early application is permitted. The impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements is currently being evaluated.   

          In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting   , which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
therein. Early application is permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this standard during the three months ended March 31, 2016. See further discussion of the impact of the adoption of
this standard in "Note B.8. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Share-based Compensation" in the notes to consolidated financial statements   

          In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   , which is intended to reduce the existing diversity in
practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2017, and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. The impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements is not expected to be material.   

          From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. We believe that the
impact of recently issued standards and any that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.   

Inflation      

Inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations in any of the reporting periods presented herein. However, our portfolio
companies have experienced, and may in the future   

  131  

Table of Contents   

  experience,
the impacts of inflation on their operating results, including periodic escalations in their costs for labor, raw materials and third party services and required energy consumption.   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      

We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our
portfolio companies. These instruments include commitments to extend credit and fund equity capital and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the balance sheet. At September 30, 2016, we had a total of $108.8 million in outstanding commitments comprised of (i) 30 investments with commitments to fund
revolving loans that had not been fully drawn or term loans with additional commitments not yet funded and (ii) nine investments with equity capital commitments that had not been fully called.   

Contractual Obligations      

As of September 30, 2016, the future fixed commitments for cash payments in connection with our SBIC debentures, the 4.50% Notes and the
6.125% Notes for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:   

(1)    The
interest due on the $6.0 million of SBIC debentures drawn in September 2016 does not have a final rate that has been fixed by the SBA as of
September 30, 2016. In March 2017, the final rate for this tranche of SBIC debentures will be determined and, thereafter, the rate will be fixed for the ensuing 10 years. The table above
assumes that the interim rate being charged as of September 30, 2016 will be used until the final maturity. This rate will be adjusted once the final rate is determined.     

As
of September 30, 2016, we had $313.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility, and the Credit Facility is currently scheduled to mature in September
2020. The Credit Facility contains two, one-year extension options which could extend the maturity to September 2022. See further discussion of the Credit Facility terms in
" Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources".   

Related Party Transactions      

As discussed further above, the External Investment Manager is treated as a wholly owned portfolio company of MSCC and is included as part of
our Investment Portfolio. At September 30, 2016, we had a receivable of $2.2 million due from the External Investment Manager which included approximately $1.4 million primarily
related to operating expenses incurred by us required to support the External Investment Manager's business, along with dividends declared but not paid by the External Investment Manager of
approximately $0.8 million.

          In
November 2015, our board of directors approved and adopted the Main Street Capital Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2015 Deferred Compensation Plan"). The 2015 Deferred
Compensation Plan became effective on January 1, 2016 and replaced the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors previously adopted by the board of directors in June 2013 (the "2013
Deferred Compensation Plan"). Under the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors and certain key employees may defer receipt of some or all of their cash compensation and directors'
fees, subject to certain limitations. Individuals participating in the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan receive distributions of their respective balances based on predetermined payout schedules or
other events as defined by the plan and are also able to direct investments made on their behalf among investment alternatives permitted from time to time under the plan, including phantom Main Street
stock units. As of September 30, 2016, $2.0 million of compensation and directors' fees had been deferred under the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan (including amounts previously deferred
under the 2013 Deferred Compensation Plan). Of this amount, $1.7 million was deferred into phantom Main Street stock units, representing 55,753 shares of our common stock. Including phantom
stock units issued through dividend reinvestment, the phantom stock units outstanding as of September 30, 2016 represented 63,257 shares of our common stock. Any amounts deferred under the plan
represented by phantom stock units will not be issued or included as outstanding on the consolidated statement of changes in net assets until such shares are actually distributed to the participant in
accordance with the plan, but are included in operating expenses and weighted average shares outstanding on our consolidated statement of operations as earned.   

Recent Developments      

During October 2016, we declared a semi-annual supplemental cash dividend of $0.275 per share payable in December 2016. This supplemental cash
dividend is in addition to the previously announced regular monthly cash dividends that we declared for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.185 per share for each of October, November and December 2016.   

In
November 2016, we declared regular monthly dividends of $0.185 per share for each month of January, February and March of 2017. These regular monthly dividends equal a total of $0.555
per share for the first quarter of 2017 and represent a 2.8% increase from the regular monthly dividends declared for the first quarter of 2016. Including the semi-annual supplemental dividend
declared for December 2016 and the regular monthly dividends declared for the first quarter of 2017, we will have paid $19.160 per share in cumulative dividends since its October 2007 initial public
offering.   

          In
October 2016, we amended our Credit Facility to extend the maturity by one year to September 2021. The Credit Facility includes total commitments of $555.0 million from a
diversified group of fourteen lenders and also contains an accordion feature which allows us to increase the total commitments under the facility to up to $750.0 million from new and existing
lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments.    

Item 3.         Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk             

          We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and
our interest income from portfolio investments and Marketable securities and idle funds investments. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set
appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks. Our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates, including LIBOR and prime rates, to the extent that
any debt investments include floating interest rates. The majority of our debt investments are made with either fixed interest rates or floating rates that are subject to contractual minimum interest
rates for the term of the investment. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 64% of our debt investment portfolio (at cost) bore interest at floating rates, 98% of which were subject to
contractual minimum interest rates. Our interest expense   

  133  

Table of Contents   

  will
be affected by changes in the published LIBOR rate in connection with our Credit Facility; however, the interest rates on our outstanding SBIC debentures, 4.50% Notes and 6.125% Notes, which
comprise the majority of our outstanding debt, are fixed for the life of such debt. As of September 30, 2016, we had not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements. The following table
shows the approximate annualized increase or decrease in the components of net investment income due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, assuming no changes in our investments and
borrowings as of September 30, 2016.   

Basis Point Change     

          The hypothetical results would also be impacted by the changes in the amount of debt outstanding under our Credit Facility (with an increase
(decrease) in the debt outstanding under the Credit Facility resulting in an (increase) decrease in the hypothetical interest expense).    

Item 4.         Controls and Procedures             

          As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our President, our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Compliance Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, our President, our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Compliance Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer, have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting them of material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There have been no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION            

Item 1.         Legal Proceedings    

          We
may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may try to
seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do
not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no
assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.    

Item 1A.         Risk Factors    

There
have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
that we filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, and as updated in our Form N-2 filed on May 16, 2016.    

Item 2.         Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    

          During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 84,153 shares of our common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan. These issuances were not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The aggregate value of the shares of common stock issued during the three months ended September 30, 2016
under the dividend reinvestment plan was approximately $2.8 million.

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS            

Introduction           

          Ethics are important to Main Street Capital Corporation (    "Main Street"     or the      "Company"    ) and to its management. Main Street is committed to the highest ethical standards and to conducting its business with the highest level of
integrity. This code of business conduct and ethics (the     "Code"    ) has been adopted by Main Street in order to establish applicable policies, guidelines,
and procedures that promote ethical practices and conduct by Main Street and all its employees, officers, and directors.   

          All
officers, directors and employees of Main Street are responsible for maintaining this level of integrity and for complying with the policies contained in this Code. If you have a
question or concern about what is proper conduct for you or anyone else, please raise these concerns with any member of management, or follow the procedures outlined in applicable sections of this
Code.   

Purpose of the Code           

          This Code is intended to:  

help you recognize ethical issues and take the appropriate steps to resolve these issues;   
            deter ethical violations and avoid any abuse of position of trust and responsibility;   
            maintain confidentiality of our business activities;   
            assist you in complying with applicable securities laws;   
            assist you in reporting any unethical or illegal conduct; and   
            reaffirm and promote our commitment to a corporate culture that values honesty and accountability.    

All
employees, as a condition of employment or continued employment, will acknowledge in writing that they have received a copy of this Code, read it, and understand that the Code
contains our expectations regarding their conduct. All employees will receive any updates and updated versions of this Code and will be required to read and acknowledge such updates.   

Conflicts of Interest           

          You must avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between your personal interests and our interests. A conflict exists when your
personal interest in any way interferes with our interests, or when you take any action or have any interest that may make it difficult for you to perform your job objectively and effectively. For
example, a conflict of interest probably exists if:  

you cause us to enter into business relationships with you or a member of your family, or invest in companies affiliated with you or a member
of your family;   
            you use any non-public information about us, our customers or our other business partners for your personal gain, or the gain of a member of
your family; or   
            you use or communicate confidential information obtained in the course of your work for your or another's personal benefit.    
 
  1  

Corporate Opportunities           

          Each of us has a duty to advance the legitimate interests of Main Street when the opportunity to do so presents itself. Therefore, you may
not:  

take for yourself personally opportunities, including investment opportunities, discovered through the use of your position with us, or through
the use of our property or information;   
            use our property, information, or position for your personal gain or the gain of a family member; or    
            compete, or prepare to compete, with us.    

Confidentiality           

          You must not disclose confidential information regarding us, our affiliates, our lenders, our clients, or our other business partners, unless
disclosure is authorized or required by law. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be harmful to, or useful to the competitors of, Main Street, our affiliates, our
lenders, our clients, or our other business partners. Even after you leave Main Street, this obligation continues until the information becomes publicly available.   

Fair Dealing           

          You must endeavor to deal fairly with our customers, suppliers and business partners, or any other companies or individuals with whom we do
business or come into contact with, including fellow employees and our competitors. You must not take unfair advantage of these or other parties by means of:  

manipulation;   
            concealment;   
            abuse of privileged information;   
            misrepresentation of material facts; or   
            any other unfair-dealing practice.    

Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets           

          Our assets are to be used only for legitimate business purposes. You should protect our assets and ensure that they are used efficiently.   

          Incidental
personal use of telephones, fax machines, copy machines, personal computers and similar equipment is generally allowed if there is no significant added cost to us, it does not
interfere with your work duties, and is not related to an illegal activity or to any outside business.   

Compliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations           

          Each of us has a duty to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business. Highlighted below are some of the key
compliance guidelines that must be followed.    

Insider trading.     It is against
the law to buy or sell securities using material information that is not available to the public. Individuals who give this "inside" information to others may be liable to the same extent as the
individuals who trade while in possession of such information. You must not trade in our securities, or the securities of our affiliates, our lenders, our clients, or our other business partners while
in the possession of "inside" information. All employees are required to be familiar and comply with our Insider Trading Policy and Procedures.    
 
  2  

"Whistleblower" protections.     It
is against the law to discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or discriminate in any manner against an employee who provides information or otherwise assists in investigations or proceedings
relating to violations of federal securities laws or other federal laws prohibiting fraud against shareholders. You must not discriminate in any way against an employee who engages in these
"whistleblower" activities.     
             Investment Company Act
requirements.     A separate code of ethics has been established to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is applicable to those persons
designated in such code.     
             Document Retention.     You must
adhere to appropriate procedures governing the retention and destruction of records consistent with applicable laws, regulations and our policies. You may not destroy, alter or falsify any document
that may be relevant to a threatened or pending lawsuit or governmental investigation.    

Please
talk to our Chief Compliance Officer if you have any questions about how to comply with the above regulations and other laws, rules and regulations.   

          In
addition, we expect you to comply with all of our policies and procedures that apply to you. We may modify or update our policies and procedures in the future, and may adopt new
policies and procedures from time to time. You are also expected to observe the terms of any confidentiality agreement, employment agreement or other similar agreement that applies to you.   

Equal Opportunity, Harassment           

          We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all of our employment practices including selection, hiring, promotion, transfer, and
compensation of all qualified applicants and employees without regard to race, color, sex or gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, national origin, handicap, disability, citizenship status, or
any other status protected by law. With this in mind, there are certain behaviors that will not be tolerated. These include harassment, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of any kind involving
race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, national origin, citizenship status, handicap, disability, marital status, or any other status protected by law.   

Political Activities           

          Main Street encourages its employees to be actively involved in the civic affairs of the communities in which they live. When speaking on public
issues, however, employees should do so only as individual citizens of the community and must be careful not to create the impression that they are acting for, or representing the views of, Main
Street. Additionally, Main Street and its employees are prohibited from making any contribution or giving a gift to a state or local political candidate, official, party or organization that would be
prohibited by applicable law. In order for the Company to determine whether a gift or political contribution may be prohibited, employees are required to provide advance notice to the Chief Compliance
Officer in advance of a proposed contribution.   

          The
Chief Compliance Officer retains discretion to monitor all business activities between the Company and the provider or recipient of any gift or political contribution in connection
with this policy. Any questions regarding this policy or the application of this policy should be directed to the Chief Compliance Officer or Chief Executive Officer.   

Loans           

          No employee may borrow funds from or become indebted to any person, business or company having business dealings or a relationship with Main
Street, except with respect to customary personal loans (   e.g.   , home mortgage loans, automobile loans, lines of credit, etc.), unless the arrangement is
disclosed in writing and receives prior written approval from the Chief Compliance Officer of the   

  3  

Company.
No employee may use the Company's name, position in a particular market or goodwill to receive any benefit on loan transactions without the prior express written consent of the Chief
Compliance Officer of the Company.   

Accuracy of Company Records           

          We require honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions. This includes such data
as quality, safety, and personnel records, as well as financial records.   

All
financial books, records and accounts must accurately reflect transactions and events, and conform both to required accounting principles and to our system of internal controls. No
false or artificial entries may be made.   

Retaining Business Communications           

          The law requires us to maintain certain types of corporate records, usually for specified periods of time. Failure to retain those records for
those minimum periods could subject us to penalties and fines, cause the loss of rights, obstruct justice, place us in contempt of court, or seriously disadvantage us in litigation.   

From
time to time we establish retention or destruction policies in order to ensure legal compliance. We expect you to fully comply with any published records retention or destruction
policies, provided that you should note the following exception: If you believe, or we inform you, that our records are relevant to any litigation or governmental action, or any potential litigation
or action, then you must preserve those records until we determine the records are no longer needed. This exception supersedes any previously or subsequently established destruction policies for those
records. If you believe that this exception may apply, or have any questions regarding the possible applicability of that exception, please contact our Chief Compliance Officer.   

Media Relations           

          We must speak with a unified voice in all dealings with the press and other media. As a result, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief
Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer or other designated persons will serve as our contact persons for media seeking information about Main Street. Any requests from the media must be referred
to our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer or other designated persons.   

Intellectual Property Information           

          Information generated in our business is a valuable asset. Protecting this information plays an important role in our growth and ability to
compete. Such information includes business and research plans; objectives and strategies; trade secrets; unpublished financial information; salary and benefits data; lender and other business partner
lists. Employees who have access to our intellectual property information are obligated to safeguard it from unauthorized access and:  

Not disclose this information to persons outside of Main Street;   
            Not use this information for personal benefit or the benefit of persons outside of Main Street; and   
            Not share this information with other employees except on a legitimate "need to know" basis.    
 
  4  

Internet and E-Mail Policy           

          We provide an e-mail system and Internet access to certain of our employees to help them do their work. You may use the e-mail system and the
Internet only for legitimate business purposes in the course of your duties. Incidental and occasional personal use is permitted, but never for personal gain or any improper use. Further, you are
prohibited from discussing or posting information regarding Main Street in any external electronic forum, including Internet chat rooms or electronic bulletin boards or social media sites.   

Reporting Violations and Complaint Handling           

          You are responsible for compliance with the rules, standards and principles described in this Code. In addition, you should be alert to possible
violations of the Code by Main Street's employees, officers and directors, and you are expected to report a violation promptly. Normally, reports should be made to one's immediate supervisor. Under
some circumstances, it may be impractical or you may feel uncomfortable raising a matter with your supervisor. In those instances, you
are encouraged to contact our Chief Compliance Officer who will investigate and report the matter to our Chief Executive Officer and/or Board of Directors, as the circumstance dictates. You will also
be expected to cooperate in an investigation of a violation.   

          Anyone
who has a concern about our conduct, the conduct of an officer of Main Street or our accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, may communicate that concern to
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors by direct communication with our Chief Compliance Officer or by email or in writing. All reported concerns shall be forwarded to the Audit Committee and
will be simultaneously addressed by our Chief Compliance Officer in the same way that other concerns are addressed by us. The status of all outstanding concerns forwarded to the Audit Committee will
be reported on a quarterly basis by our Chief Compliance Officer. The Audit Committee may direct that certain matters be presented to the full board and may also direct special treatment, including
the retention of outside advisors or counsel, for any concern reported to it.   

          All
reports will be investigated and whenever possible, requests for confidentiality shall be honored. And, while anonymous reports will be accepted, please understand that anonymity may
hinder or impede the investigation of a report. All cases of questionable activity or improper actions will be reviewed for appropriate action, discipline or corrective actions. Whenever possible, we
will keep confidential the identity of employees, officers or directors who are accused of violations, unless or until it has been determined that a violation has occurred.   

There will be no reprisal, retaliation or adverse action taken against any employee who, in good faith, reports or assists in the investigation of, a violation or
suspected violation, or who makes an inquiry about the appropriateness of an anticipated or actual course of action.   

For reporting concerns about Main Street's conduct, the conduct of an officer of Main Street, or about Main Street's accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters, you may use the following means of communication:   

In
the case of a confidential, anonymous submission, employees should set forth their concerns in writing and forward them in a sealed envelope to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee,
in care of our Chief Compliance Officer, such envelope to be labeled with a legend such as: "To be opened by the Audit Committee only."   

  5  

Administration of the Code           

          The Chief Compliance Officer has overall responsibility for administering the Code and reporting on the administration of and compliance with
the Code and related matters to our Board of Directors.   

Sanctions for Code Violations           

          All violations of the Code will result in appropriate corrective action, up to and including dismissal. If the violation involves potentially
criminal activity, the individual or individuals in question will be reported, as warranted, to the appropriate authorities.   

Application/Waivers           

          All of our directors, officers and employees are subject to this Code.   

Any
amendment or waiver of the Code for an executive officer or member of our Board of Directors must be made by our Board of Directors and will be publicly disclosed in the manner
required pursuant to Item 5.05 of Form 8-K.   

Revisions and Amendments           

          This Code may be revised, changed or amended at any time by our Board of Directors. Following any material revisions or updates, an updated
version of this Code will be distributed to you, and will supersede the prior version of this Code effective upon distribution. We may ask you to sign an acknowledgement confirming that you have read
and understood the revised version of the Code, and that you agree to comply with the provisions.

I,
Vincent D. Foster, certify that:   

1.    I
have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 of Main Street Capital Corporation (the
"registrant");
      2.    Based
on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
      3.    Based
on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
      4.    The
registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

(a)    Designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
prepared;
      (b)    Designed
such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
      (c)    Evaluated
the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
      (d)    Disclosed
in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter
(the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting; and
     
   5.    The
registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's
auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

(a)    All
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
      (b)    Any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.
