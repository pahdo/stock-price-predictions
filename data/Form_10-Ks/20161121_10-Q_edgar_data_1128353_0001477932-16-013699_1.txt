      Table of Contents            ENERTECK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION      The accompanying Unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of EnerTeck Corporation have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in EnerTeck s Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015 as reported in the Form 10-K have been omitted.      NOTE 2   INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE       The basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.      During the first quarter of 2015, investors contributed $317,500 for a total of 1,525,000 shares of Enerteck common stock with an additional $35,000 contributed during the second quarter for additional 175,000 shares. In addition, 100,000 shares of common stock valued at $20,000 were issued for cancellation of a warrant. During the first two quarters of 2016, $11,453 was contributed for a total of 38,177 shares of Enerteck common stock.      Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders, adjusted on an "as if converted" basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For 2016 and 2015, potential dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share.      NOTE 3   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY      In July 2006, EnerTeck acquired the EnerBurn technology. The purchase price for the EnerBurn technology is as follows: (i) $1.0 million cash paid on July 13, 2006, and (ii) a promissory note for $2.0 million. In May of 2007, we made the initial payment of $500,000 plus interest against the loan. Prior to 2009 EnerTeck had determined that the life of the intellectual property was indefinite; therefore, the asset was not amortized. The Company tested its intangible assets for impairment as of December 31, 2008. As a result of an independent examination based on sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company determined that an impairment of the asset in the amount of $825,000 was required to be recorded.      Management made the decision during 2009 to change the characterization of its intellectual property to a finite-lived asset and to amortize the remaining balance of its intangible assets to the nominal value of $150,000 by the end of 2013, due to its determination that this now represents the scheduled end of its exclusive registration during that period. As a result, amortization expense of approximately $579,000 was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010 and zero since that time.      Management made the decision effective December 31, 2010 to record an additional impairment of the asset in the amount of $868,000 as a result of the Company s inability to generate sufficient sales to support its previously recorded amount. This impairment adjustment results in a value of $150,000 being placed on the Company's intellectual property, which management believes is adequately supported by existing levels of sales and market data.                 7       
      Table of Contents           NOTE 4     STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY       During the first quarter of 2011, the Company received an advance of $125,000 in gross proceeds for 250,000 shares of common stock at $.50 per share from three investors in a private placement offering to accredited investors only. During the first quarter of 2012 and following completion of the subscription agreements, the Company issued 175,000 shares to two of such investors in connection with gross proceeds of $87,500. Pending completion of the subscription agreement from the third investor, the balance of 75,000 shares will be issued in connection with the remaining gross proceeds of $37,500.     During the first quarter of 2015, the Company sold to one accredited investor in a private placement offering 125,000 shares of common stock at $0.20 per share or $25,000 in the aggregate.      During the first quarter of 2015, the Company sold to a shareholder/director 1,150,000 shares of common stock at $0.20 per share or $230,000 in the aggregate which funds were provided to the Company in the first quarter of 2015. These shares were issued during the first month of the second quarter of 2015.     During the first quarter of 2013, the Company granted 400,000 warrants to an unrelated third party for services rendered with an exercise price of $0.25 per share. Such warrants had a term of seven years. Pursuant to a Settlement Agreement and Release effective as of February 26, 2015, such warrants were cancelled and in place thereof the Company paid $62,500 and issued 100,000 shares of common stock, valued at $20,000, to such third party. This incremental cost for cancellation of the warrants resulted in a $82,500 charge to operations during the three months ended March 31, 2015. In connection therewith, the Company sold a shareholder/director 250,000 shares of common stock at $0.25 per share or $62,500 in the aggregate which funds were used to pay the amount payable under the aforesaid Settlement Agreement and Release.      During the second quarter of 2016, the Company issued 71,676 shares of common stock to two accredited investors for an aggregate of $21,503 received in a private placement offering of common stock at $0.30 per share. Of such proceeds, $10,050 was received in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $11,453 was received in the first quarter of 2016.       NOTE 5   STOCK WARRANTS AND OPTIONS       Stock Warrants      See Note 4 for information on the cancellation during the first quarter of 2015 of 400,000 warrants granted to an unrelated third party during the first quarter of 2013.      There were no warrants granted or exercised for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. No warrants expired during the year ended December 31, 2015, although 2,050,000 expired in the second quarter of 2016 and an additional 1,640,000 warrants expired during the third quarter of 2016. Warrants outstanding and exercisable as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:                        8       
      Table of Contents           As of August 31, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized and approved the extension of the expiration dates of 3,690,000 warrants which expired in the second and third quarter of 2016 for a period of five years from their respective original expiration dates. The documentation confirming such extensions is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. Until then, the expired warrants are not reflected as being outstanding.      The fair value of warrants extended in 2016 at the extension date (grant date) was $973,105 and was recognized as non-cash compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as estimated using the Black-Scholes Model with the following weighted average assumptions:            Stock Options      In September 2003, shareholders of the Company approved an employee stock option plan (the  2003 Option Plan ) authorizing the issuance of options to purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock. The 2003 Option Plan is intended to give the Company greater ability to attract, retain, and motivate officers, key employees, directors and consultants; and is intended to provide the Company with the ability to provide incentives more directly linked to the success of the Company s business and increases in shareholder value.     During the third quarter of 2013, the board of directors increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2003 Option Plan from 1,000,000 to 1,250,000.      On August 2, 2016, options to acquire 227,510 shares were issued under our 2003 Stock Option Plan to five employees which options are immediately exercisable. These options have an exercise price of $0.30 per share and expire in five years from their issue date.      The fair value of these options at the date of grant was $38,560 and was recognized as non-cash compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as estimated using the Black-Scholes Model with the following weighted average assumptions:                       9       
      Table of Contents          In addition, on September 21, 2016, an option to acquire 150,000 shares was issued under our 2003 Stock Option Plan to Lynne Cornwell, an employee, 50% of which shall vest and be exercisable six months after the grant date, and the remaining 50% shall vest and be exercisable on December 31, 2017.      The fair value of these options at the date of grant was $26,802. This cost is being recognized as non-cash compensation over the vesting period, of which $1,122 was reported for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as estimated using the Black-Scholes Model with the following weighted average assumptions:           As of August 31, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized and approved the extension of the expiration dates of 225,001 options which expired in the third quarter of 2016 for a period of five years from their respective original expiration dates. The documentation confirming such extensions is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016. Until then, the expired options are not reflected as being outstanding.     The fair value of these options at the date of grant was $59,340 and was recognized as non-cash compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as estimated using the Black-Scholes Model with the following weighted average assumptions:           The expected term of the options and warrants represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on the Company s historical experience of similar option grants, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury bill rate in effect at the time of grant with an equivalent expected term or life. The Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not currently plan to pay any dividends in the future.     Other than the foregoing, there were no options granted or exercised for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. No options expired during the year ended December 31, 2015, although 225,001 expired in the third quarter of 2016.             Information regarding activity for stock options under our plan is as follows:                    Options exercisable at end of period             0                 823,269          Non-vested options at end of period             0                 0          Weighted-average                                               Remaining contractual term   all options         2.4 yrs.              2.5 yrs.

Fair value of options vested during the period        $  0            $  0          Aggregate intrinsic value        $  0            $  0              NOTE 6   RELATED PARTY NOTES AND ADVANCES      On July 7, 2009, the Company entered into a $100,000 unsecured promissory note with an officer, due on demand. Interest is payable at 12% per annum. Also, on December 11, 2009, the Company entered into a $50,000 note with a shareholder/director. Interest is 5% per annum. The principal balance of the note is due on the earlier of December 11, 2013, or upon completion by the Company of equity financing in excess of $1.0 million in gross proceeds. Interest on the loan is payable on the maturity date at the rate of 5% per annum. This note is now overdue for payment.            On June 1, 2010, the Company entered into a $50,000 convertible promissory note with a shareholder/director which shall be due and payable on June 1, 2013 and accrues interest at 8.0% per annum payable at maturity and which may be converted at any time into shares of common stock. The assignment of the conversion feature of the note resulted in a loan discount being recorded. The discount amount of $36,207 was being amortized over the original thirty-six month term of the debt as additional interest expense. Amortization for this loan was $0 and $12,069 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This note is now overdue for payment.     On June 1, 2010, the Company entered into $300,000 of convertible promissory notes with a shareholder/director which shall be due and payable on June 1, 2013 and accrue interest at 8.0% per annum payable at maturity and which may be converted at any time into shares of common stock. This note is now overdue for payment.     On July 20, 2010, the Company entered into $400,000 convertible promissory notes with a shareholders/director which shall be due and payable on July 20, 2013 and accrue interest at 8.0% per annum payable at maturity and which may be converted at any time into shares of common stock. These notes are now overdue for payment.     On December 10, 2010, the Company entered into $150,000 of convertible promissory notes with shareholders/director which shall be due and payable on December 10, 2013 and accrue interest at 8.0% per annum payable at maturity and which may be converted at any time into shares of common stock. These notes are now overdue for payment.     On October 20, 2011, the Company entered into a $70,000 convertible promissory note with a shareholder/director which shall be due and payable on October 20, 2014 and accrue interest at 8.0% per annum payable at maturity and which may be converted at any time into shares of common stock. This note is now overdue for payment.     During 2010, 2011 and 2012 such shareholder/director advanced the Company $100,000, $150,000 and $370,000 respectively. Such advances are due on demand and bear interest at 5%, 8% and 8% per annum respectively. During the second quarter of 2015, $320,000 of the advances during 2012 were converted into shares of common stock of the Company.      During 2013, such shareholder/director advanced the Company $175,000 expected to be applied to stock subscriptions to be issued at a future date. Such advances do not bear interest. During the second quarter of 2015, all of these advances totaling $175,000 were converted into shares of common stock of the Company.      During 2014, such shareholder/director advanced the Company $300,000 expected to be applied to stock subscriptions to be issued at a future date. Such advances do not bear interest. During the second quarter of 2015, all of these advances totaling $300,000 were converted into shares of common stock of the Company.      During the third and fourth quarters of 2015, such shareholder/director contributed $200,000 to the Company expected to be applied to stock subscriptions to be issued at a future date. Such advances do not bear interest. This amount has been recorded as additional notes payable until such time as the stock is issued.     During the first, second and third quarters of 2016, such shareholder/director contributed $375,000 to the Company expected to be applied to stock subscriptions to be issued at a future date. Such advances do not bear interest. This amount has been recorded as additional notes payable until such time as the stock is issued.             NOTE 7     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES        Office Lease       EnerTeck leases office space under a non-cancelable operating lease. Future minimum rentals due under non-cancelable operating leases with an original maturity of at least one-year are approximately as follow:           This lease provides for a rent-free period as well as increasing rental payments. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, rent expense for financial statement purposes is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. A deferred lease liability arises from the timing difference in the recognition of rent expense and the actual payment of rent.     Rent expense for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $38,347 and $36,940, respectively.       Ability to Continue as a Going Concern      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred recurring net losses of $1,323,000 and $1,255,000, respectively. In addition, at September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $34,274,000. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.      The Company s continuation as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to obtain additional financing and to generate revenues and cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis. Management concedes that sales revenues for 2016 to date and 2015 and for years prior have been considerably less than earlier anticipated primarily due to circumstances which have been corrected or are in the process of being corrected. Tests which were expected to be run and completed during 2013 and 2014 were, for reasons beyond the Company s control either delayed, rescheduled or in some cases gave inconclusive results, such as the PEx river test. Management expected that marine, railroad and trucking sales would show significant increases in 2015 over what has been generated in the past. That has not materialized, as of yet. Delays in the completion of long term client demonstrations for several extremely large new clients which were initially intended to be completed during 2014 have caused problems which have been very hard to overcome. The PEx technology testing and analysis, which appeared to be extremely successful, was not completed due to financial reversals on the part of the independent testing company. Conclusive testing of the PEx technology will have to be totally redone to prove the marketability of the product line. On the upside, testing is underway for several large new domestic clients of our principal domestic distributor, which look extremely promising to date. Other tests are however finally close to completion. While it remains to be seen if all will be successful, it is believed that the final results will be in our favor and that the company will show significant improvement over the next two years.      The Company has been able to generate working capital in the past through private placements and issuing promissory notes and believes that these avenues will remain available to the Company if additional financing is necessary. No assurance can be made that any of these efforts will be successful.              NOTE 8     CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK      Financial instruments that potentially subject EnerTeck to concentration of credit risk are accounts receivable. Currently all Accounts Receivable are considered collectible, except as noted. EnerTeck performs ongoing credit evaluations as to the financial condition of its customers. Generally, no collateral is required.      EnerTeck at times has cash in bank in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance limits. On September 30, 2016, EnerTeck had slightly more than $10,000 in cash, which is insured.     For the nine months ended June 30, 2016, sales to one customers exceeded 60% of total sales. That customer represented approximately 25% of net accounts receivable at September 30, 2016.       NOTE 9     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS        In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and limited early adoption is permitted. ASU 2014-09 permits the use of two transition methods, either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company has not yet selected a transition method, and is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements.      In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ("ASU 2014-15"). Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. The update provides guidance on when there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and how the underlying conditions and events should be disclosed in the footnotes. It is intended to reduce diversity that existed in footnote disclosures because of the lack of guidance about when substantial doubt existed. The amendments in this update are effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.     In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03     Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset, consistent with debt discounts. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and required retrospective application. Early adoption permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which simplifies the measurement of inventories valued under most methods. Under this new guidance, inventories valued under these methods would be valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling price less reasonable costs to sell the inventory. The new guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal periods starting after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.            In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, " Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .  The amendments in ASU 2015-17 eliminate the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842) ,  which requires lessees to recognize most lease liabilities on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. The update states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) .  The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation   which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption will be permitted in any interim or annual period for which financial statements have not yet been issued or have not been made available for issuance. If early adoption is elected, all amendments in the ASU that apply must be adopted in the same period. In addition, if early adoption is elected in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.     Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.      NOTE 10   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS        See Note 6 for information on related party notes and advances from a director/shareholder. Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2016, such shareholder/director contributed an additional $25,000 to the Company expected to be applied to stock subscriptions to be issued at a future date. Such advances do not bear interest. This amount has been recorded as additional notes payable until such time as the stock is issued.     In November 2016, the Company issued warrants to each of the three current directors of the Company to acquire 250,000 shares each of the Company s common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.30 per share and expire in five years from their issue date.               Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.       The following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company included elsewhere herein.      Forward Looking Statements      When used in this report, the words  may,   will,   expect,   anticipate,   continue,   estimate,   intend,   plans , and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements regarding events, conditions and financial trends which may affect our future plans of operations, business strategy, operating results and financial position. Forward looking statements in this report include without limitation statements relating to trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations, our business and growth strategies and our financing plans.     Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Such factors include, among other things, general economic conditions; cyclical factors affecting our industry; lack of growth in our industry; our ability to comply with government regulations; a failure to manage our business effectively; our ability to sell products at profitable yet competitive prices; and other risks and factors set forth from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission     Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revision of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.       Executive Overview      EnerTeck Corporation (the  Company  or  EnerTeck Parent ), formerly named Gold Bond Mining Company and then Gold Bond Resources, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Washington on July 30, 1935. We acquired EnerTeck Chemical Corp. ( EnerTeck Sub ) as a wholly owned subsidiary on January 9, 2003. As a result of this acquisition, we are now acting as a holding company, with EnerTeck Sub as our primary operating business. Subsequent to this transaction, on November 24, 2003 we changed our domicile from the State of Washington to the State of Delaware and changed our name from Gold Bond Resources, Inc. to EnerTeck Corporation. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms  we,   us  or  our  refer to EnerTeck Corporation and its consolidated subsidiary.     EnerTeck Sub, our wholly owned operating subsidiary, was incorporated in the State of Texas on November 29, 2000. It was formed for the purpose of commercializing a diesel fuel specific combustion catalyst known as EnerBurn (TM), as well as other combustion enhancement and emission reduction technologies. Nalco/Exxon Energy Chemicals, L.P. ( Nalco/Exxon L.P. ), a joint venture between Nalco Chemical Corporation and Exxon Corporation commercially introduced EnerBurn in 1998. When Nalco/Exxon L.P. went through an ownership change in 2000, our founder, Dwaine Reese, formed EnerTeck Sub. It acquired the EnerBurn trademark and related assets and took over the Nalco/Exxon L.P. relationship with the EnerBurn formulator and blender, and its supplier, Ruby Cat Technology, LLC ( Ruby Cat ).      We utilize a sales process that includes detailed proprietary customer fleet monitoring protocols in on-road applications that quantify data and assists in managing certain internal combustion diesel engine operating results while utilizing EnerBurn. Test data prepared by Southwest Research Institute and actual customer usage has indicated that the use of EnerBurn in diesel engines improves fuel economy, lowers smoke, and decreases engine wear and the dangerous emissions of both Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and microscopic airborne solid matter (particulates). Our principal target markets have included the trucking, heavy construction, maritime shipping, railroad and mining industries, as well as federal, state and international government applications. Each of these industries shares certain common financial characteristics, i.e. (i) diesel fuel represents a disproportionate share of operating costs; and (ii) relatively small operating margins are prevalent. Considering these factors, management believes that the use of EnerBurn and the corresponding derived savings in diesel fuel costs can positively affect the operating margins of its customers while contributing to a cleaner environment.     During 2011, we acquired a 40% membership interest in a newly formed entity called EnerTeck Environmental, LLC, which was formed for the purpose of marketing and selling a diesel fuel emission reduction technology with the creators of such specific technology.               Results of Operations       Revenues      We recorded $81,000 of sales revenues for the three months and $171,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to sales revenues of $79,000 for the three months and $219,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Testing is either underway or recently completed with several potential customers and in new areas with existing customers, more sales should occur. It is expected that sales should show significant increases during the remainder of 2016.       Gross Profit       Gross profit, defined as revenues less cost of goods sold, was $67,000 or 82.7% of sales for the three month period and $141,000 or 82.1% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $17,000 or 21.8% of sales for the three month period and $131,000 or 59.7 % of sales for the period ended September 30, 2015. As our overall volumes increase, we feel confident that there will be an improvement in the gross profit percentage as our manufacturing proficiency continues to improve for our core products.      Cost of goods sold was $14,000 and $31,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, which represented 17.3% and 17.9% of revenues respectively, as compared to was $61,000 and 88,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, which represented 77.9% and 40.3%.       Costs and Expenses      Operating expenses were $1,330,000 for the three months and $1,898,000 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $277,000 for the three months and $959,000 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2015. The primary increase in operating expenses was due to the noncash stock based compensation issued during the third quarter. Costs and expenses in all periods primarily consisted of payroll, professional fees, rent expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense and other general and administrative expenses.       Net Loss      We reported a net loss of $1,323,000 during the three months and $1,915,000 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net losses of $305,000 and $975,000 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015. We believe that current sales activity will increase for the remainder of the 2016 calendar year and into 2017 due to the success of certain recently completed testing and negotiations for and with new customers.       Operations Outlook      The majority of our marketing effort since 2005 has been directed at targeting and gaining a foothold in one of several major target areas, including the inland marine diesel market, trucking, heavy construction and mining. Management has focused virtually all resources at pinpointing and convincing certain large potential customers within these markets, with our diesel fuel additive product lines. While we still believe that this is a valid theory, the results, to date, have been less than we had expected. For example, in 2005, we appointed Custom Fuel Services Inc., a subsidiary of Ingram Barge and which provides dockside and midstream fueling from nine service locations in Louisiana, Kentucky, Illinois, West Virginia, Missouri and Iowa, as our exclusive reseller of EnerBurn and the related technology on the Western Rivers of the United States, meaning the Mississippi River, its tributaries, South Pass, and Southwest Pass, excluding the Intra Coastal Waterway. Since 2006, sales have been sporadic with Custom and we cannot guarantee that we will ever generate meaningful revenues from our relationship with Custom.             Management concedes that sales revenues for 2016, 2015 and several years prior have been considerably less than earlier anticipated primarily due to circumstances which we are making a continued effort to correct. Tests which were expected to be run and completed in prior periods, for reasons beyond the Company s control either delayed, rescheduled or in some cases gave inconclusive results, such as the PEx river test. Management expected that marine, heavy construction and trucking sales would show significant increases in 2016 over what has been generated in the past. Delays in the completion of long term client demonstrations for several extremely large new clients which were initially intended to be completed during prior years have caused problems which have been very hard to overcome. The PEx technology testing and analysis, which appeared to be extremely successful, was not completed due to financial reversals on the part of the independent testing company. Conclusive testing of the PEx technology will now have to be totally redone to prove the marketability of the product line. On the upside, testing is underway for several large new domestic and foreign clients of our principal domestic distributor, which look extremely promising to date. While it remains to be seen if all will be successful, it is believed that the final results will be in our favor and that the Company will show significant improvement over the next two years.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      On September 30, 2016, we had working capital deficit of ($6,599,000) and a stockholders  deficit of ($6,426,000) compared to a working capital deficit of ($5,781,000) and a stockholders  deficit of ($5,605,000) on December 31, 2015. Our continuing deficit levels primarily stems from poor sales, despite extremely good client product testing results. On September 30, 2016, we had $10,000 in cash, total assets of $434,000 and total liabilities of $6,859,000, compared to $10,000 in cash, total assets of $431,000 and total liabilities of $6,035,000 on December 31, 2015.     Net cash used in operating activities was $395,000 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, which was primarily due to a net loss of ($1,915,000), plus changes in prepaid expenses of ($12,000), accounts receivable of ($21,000) and customer deposits of ($25,000), offset by stock based compensation of $1,072,000, inventory of $25,000, accounts payable of $22,000, accrued interest payable of $160,000 and accrued liabilities of $294,000. Net cash used in operating activities was $452,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was primarily due to a net loss of ($975,000), plus changes in accounts receivable of ($25,000), prepaid expenses of ($17,000) and inventory of ($8,000), offset by changes in accounts payable of $36,000, accrued interest payable of $150,000 and accrued liabilities of $360,000.      Cash used in investing activities was $500 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and $400 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2015.      Cash provided by financing activities was $395,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which was comprised of proceeds from the sales of common stock of $11,000 and related party note payable and advances of $384,000 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $463,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which was comprised primarily of proceeds from sales of stock of $353,000 and $110,000 from related party note payable and advances.      On July 13, 2006, we completed the acquisition of the EnerBurn formulas, technology and associated assets pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement executed as of the same date (the  EnerBurn Acquisition Agreement ) between the Company and the owner of Ruby Cat (the  Seller ). Pursuant thereto, the Company acquired from the Seller all of its rights with respect to the liquid diesel motor vehicle fuel additives known as EC5805A and EC5931A products (the  Products ) as well as its rights to certain intellectual property and technology associated with the Products (collectively, the  Purchased Assets ). The purchase price for the Purchased Assets was $3.0 million, payable as follows: (i) $1.0 million paid on July 13, 2006 in cash, and (ii) the remaining $2.0 million evidenced by a promissory note (the  Note ) bearing interest each month at a rate of 4.0% per annum, compounded monthly, and which shall be paid in four annual payments of $500,000 plus accumulated interest to that date on each anniversary of the closing until the entire purchase price is paid in full. All payments have been made and, as of July 2010, we have now completed our monetary obligations under the EnerBurn Acquisition Agreement and the Note. Through 2010 this obligation drew significantly on our cash reserves. Starting in 2011 this is no longer the case.               In the past, we have been able to finance our operations primarily from capital which has been raised. To date, sales have not been adequate to finance our operations without investment capital. During 2016 to date and in 2015, financing activities provided $395,000 and $463,000, respectively, for working capital from the proceeds from sales of common stock, loans and other advances.      We anticipate, based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations, that in addition to our current cash and cash equivalents together with projected cash flows from operations and projected revenues we will require additional investment to satisfy our contemplated cash requirements for the next 12 months. No assurance can be made that we will be able to obtain such investment on terms acceptable to us or at all. We anticipate that our costs and expenses over the next 12 months will be approximately $3.0 million. Our continuation as a going concern is contingent upon our ability to obtain additional financing and to generate revenues and cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis. As mentioned above, management acknowledges that sales revenues have been considerably less than earlier anticipated. This was primarily due to a combination of circumstances which have been corrected or are in the process of being corrected and therefore should not reoccur in the future and the general state of the economy. Management expects that sales should show increases in latter part of 2016 and into 2017. No assurances can be made that we will be able to obtain required financial on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our contemplated cash requirements beyond 2016 will depend primarily upon level of sales of our products, inventory levels, product development, sales and marketing expenditures and capital expenditures.      Due to our lack of meaningful revenues, we have been forced to finance our operations primarily from capital which has been raised from third parties and promissory notes and advances from related parties. As of December 31, 2015, such loans and advances from related parties total $1,730,000 as compared to $2,315,000 for the previous year. The decrease in this number is due to the decision of a related party (who is a principal shareholder and director of the Company) to convert a sizable amount of this debt to equity in the form of 3,173,811 shares of common stock which was issued during the second quarter on 2015. Many of these loans are past due and certain others are due on demand. The Company does not expect any of such related parties to demand payment until the Company has adequate resources to pay back such loans and advances, there can be no assurance that such will be the case. This debt presents a significant risk to the Company in that in the event any of such related parties demand payment, the Company may not have the necessary cash to meet such payment obligations, or if it does, such payments may draw significantly on the Company s cash position. Any of such events will likely have a materially detrimental effect on the Company. The related party, who is a principal shareholder and director of the Company and has advanced most of the funds to date, has expressed his interest in converting the majority of his remaining loans to common stock at some point in the future, although there can be no assurance that such will be completed on terms acceptable to the Company.      Inflation has not significantly impacted the Company s operations.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements       We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, and results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.      Significant Accounting Policies       Business and Basis of Presentation       EnerTeck Corporation, formerly Gold Bond Resources, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on July 30, 1935. On January 9, 2003, the Company acquired EnerTeck Chemical Corp. ("EnerTeck Sub") as its wholly owned operating subsidiary. As a result of the acquisition, the Company is now acting as a holding company, with EnerTeck Sub as its only operating business. Subsequent to this transaction, on November 24, 2003, the Company changed its domicile from the State of Washington to the State of Delaware, changed its name from Gold Bond Resources, Inc. to EnerTeck Corporation.               EnerTeck Sub, the Company s wholly owned operating subsidiary is a Houston-based corporation. It was incorporated in the State of Texas on November 29, 2000 and was formed for the purpose of commercializing a diesel fuel specific combustion catalyst known as EnerBurn (TM), as well as other combustion enhancement and emission reduction technologies for diesel fuel. EnerTeck s primary product is EnerBurn, and is registered for highway use in all USA diesel applications. The products are used primarily in on-road vehicles, locomotives and diesel marine engines throughout the United States and select foreign markets.      During 2012, EnerTeck acquired a 40% membership interest in EnerTeck Environmental, LLC (Environmental). Environmental was formed for the purpose of marketing and selling diesel fuel emission reduction technology with the creators of such specific technology.       Principles of Consolidation      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EnerTeck Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, EnerTeck Chemical Corp. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.      Cash and Cash Equivalents      The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three (3) months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.      Inventory       Inventory primarily consists of market ready EnerBurn plus raw materials required to manufacture the products. Inventory has been valued at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method.       Accounts Receivable      Accounts receivable represent uncollateralized obligations due from customers of the Company and are recorded at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. The Company calculates this allowance based on historical write-offs, level of past due accounts and relationships with and economic status of the customers. Accounts are written off as bad debts when all collection efforts have failed and the account is deemed uncollectible.       Property and Equipment       Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for on the straight-line or accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The average lives range from five (5) to ten (10) years. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Betterments or renewals are capitalized when incurred.                Intangible Assets      The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 350,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . FASB ASC 350 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Specifically, FASB ASC 350 addresses how intangible assets that are acquired should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition, as well as how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. The statement requires the Company to evaluate its intellectual property each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life. In addition, the Company tests its intellectual property for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The statement requires intangible assets with finite lives to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable and that a loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible exceeds its fair value.       Revenue Recognition       The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and recognizes revenues when evidence of a completed transaction and customer acceptance exists, and when title passes, if applicable.      Revenues from sales of product and equipmentare recognized at the point when a customer order has been shipped and invoiced.      Income Taxes       The Company will compute income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on evidence from prior years, may not be realized over the next calendar year or for some years thereafter.      The current and deferred tax provisions in the financial statements include consideration of uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes . Management believes there are no significant uncertain tax positions, so no adjustments have been reported from adoption of FASB ASC 740. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state jurisdictions.      Income (Loss) Per Common Share       The basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.       Management Estimates and Assumptions       The accompanying financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.                    Financial Instruments      The Company s financial instruments recorded on the balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and note payable. The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.      Stock Options and Warrants       Effective January 1, 2006, the Company began recording compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718,  Stock Compensation.       Taxes Collected       The Company collects sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities imposed on certain sales to customers. Sales taxes collected are included in revenues; net amounts paid are reported as expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.       Website Costs      As more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2015, the Company acquired the rights to various domain names relevant to its business. The cost of these domain names was $8,497 and has been capitalized as part of website costs on the balance sheet. Management intends to continually renew these domain names, therefore, they are considered non-amortizable intangible assets.       Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements       In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and limited early adoption is not permitted. ASU 2014-09 permits the use of two transition methods, either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company has not yet selected a transition method, and is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements.      In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ("ASU 2014-15"). ASU 2014-15 defines management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and provides related footnote disclosure requirements. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. The update provides guidance on when there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and how the underlying conditions and events should be disclosed in the footnotes. It is intended to reduce diversity that existed in footnote disclosures because of the lack of guidance about when substantial doubt existed. The amendments in this update are effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the financial statements and related disclosures.             In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03     Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset, consistent with debt discounts. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and required retrospective application. Early adoption permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.     In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which simplifies the measurement of inventories valued under most methods. Under this new guidance, inventories valued under these methods would be valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling price less reasonable costs to sell the inventory. The new guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal periods starting after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.     In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, " Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .  The amendments in ASU 2015-17 eliminate the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842) ,  which requires lessees to recognize most lease liabilities on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. The update states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) .  The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation   which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption will be permitted in any interim or annual period for which financial statements have not yet been issued or have not been made available for issuance. If early adoption is elected, all amendments in the ASU that apply must be adopted in the same period. In addition, if early adoption is elected in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.     Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.       Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures.       Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.      There have been no material changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.           PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings.       The Company is not currently a party to any pending material legal proceeding nor is it aware of any proceeding contemplated by any individual, company, entity or governmental authority involving the Company.
