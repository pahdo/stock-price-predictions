  NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The NACC business will be integrated into the existing customer communications business and is now known as Broadridge Customer Communications. 
    
  In September 2016, Broadridge acquired intellectual property assets from Inveshare, Inc. ( Inveshare ) and concurrently entered into a development agreement with an affiliate of Inveshare to use these assets to develop

     B. Consolidation and Basis of Presentation  . The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America ( U.S. ). These financial statements present the condensed consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016   (the    2016   Annual Report ) filed on August 9, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with GAAP of the Company s financial position at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , the results of its operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and its cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and   2015  .  
  Effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company revised the presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings to separately present Interest expense, net. Previously, Interest expense, net, was reported as part of Non-operating expenses, net, and was not separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. All prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation. See Note 4,  Interest Expense, Net,  for details of the Company s Interest expense, net, and Note 5,  Other Non-Operating Expenses, Net,  for details of the Company s Other non-operating expenses, net. 
  Effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU No. 2015-03 ), which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The Company has applied this guidance on a retrospective basis and accordingly, the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   June 30, 2016   has been updated to reflect this new classification, which resulted in a decrease in Other non-current assets of   $7.1 million  , a decrease in Long-term debt, excluding current portion of   $7.0 million   and a decrease of   $0.1 million   in Current portion of long-term debt at   June 30, 2016  .  
    C. Use of Estimates  . The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto. These estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the Company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions and judgment that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.  
  D. Cash and Cash Equivalents  . Investment securities with an original maturity of   90 days   or less are considered cash equivalents. The fair value of the Company s Cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value due to their short term nature. 
  E. Financial Instruments  . Substantially all of the financial instruments of the Company other than Long-term debt are carried at fair values, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair values because of the short maturity of the instruments. The carrying value of the Company s long-term fixed-rate senior notes represents the face value of the long-term fixed-rate senior notes net of the unamortized discount and net of the associated unamortized debt issuance cost. The fair value of the

     Table of Contents  

Company s long-term fixed-rate senior notes is based on quoted market prices. Refer to Note 10,  Borrowings,  for a further discussion of the Company s long-term fixed-rate senior notes. 
  F. Subsequent Events  . In preparing the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has reviewed events that have occurred after   September 30, 2016  , through the date of issuance of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 16,  Subsequent Event  for a description of the Company s subsequent event. 
   
  NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
        In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU No. 2016-09 ). ASU No. 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including presenting the excess tax benefit or deficit from the exercise or vesting of share-based payments in the income statement, a revision to the criteria for classifying an award as equity or liability, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. In addition, ASU No. 2016-09 eliminates the excess tax benefit from the assumed proceeds calculation under the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted shares. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for the Company beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted. Certain provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 are required to be adopted prospectively, most notably the requirement to recognize the excess tax benefit or deficit in the income statement, while other provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 require modified retrospective application or in some cases full retrospective application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases  ( ASU No. 2016-02 ). Under ASU No. 2016-02, all lease arrangements exceeding a twelve month term must now be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee by recording a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease obligation generally equal to the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. Further, the income statement will reflect lease expense for leases classified as operating and amortization/interest expense for leases classified as financing, determined using classification criteria substantially similar to the current lease guidance for distinguishing between an operating and capital lease. ASU No. 2016-02 also contains certain additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.  ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and will be adopted on a modified retrospective basis, which will require adjustment to all comparative periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ( ASU No. 2016-01 ), which provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for the Company beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The pending adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU No. 
  2015-17 ). The amendments in ASU No. 2015-17 require entities that present a classified balance sheet to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as a noncurrent amount. The amendments in ASU No. 2015-17 are effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The pending adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  ( ASU No. 2015-05 ). ASU No. 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. ASU No. 2015-05 does not change the accounting for a customer s accounting for service contracts. Following adoption of ASU No. 2015-05, all software licenses within its scope are accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets. The Company adopted No. 2015-05 effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU No. 
  2015-03 ), to require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU No. 2015-03 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We have adopted this standard as of July 1, 2016 with retrospective application. See Note 1,  Basis of Presentation  for additional information related to this adoption. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU No. 2014-9 ), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date,  which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year, with an option that would permit companies to adopt the standard as early as the original effective date. As a result, ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for the Company as of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU No. 2014-09; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU No. 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per ASU No. 2014-09.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ( ASU No. 2016-08 ), which provides clarifying implementation guidance to the principal versus agent provisions of ASU No. 2014-09.  
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU No. 2016-10 ), which provides clarifying implementation guidance for applying ASU No. 2014-09 with respect to identifying performance obligations and the accounting for licensing arrangements.  
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ( ASU No. 2016-12 ), which provides certain clarifying guidance for ASU No. 2014-09 relative to treatment of sales taxes, noncash consideration, collectibility and certain aspects of transitional guidance. Each of ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10 and ASU No. 2016-12 have the same effective date as ASU No. 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10 and ASU No. 2016-12 on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  NOTE 3. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is calculated by dividing the Company s Net earnings by the basic Weighted-average shares outstanding for the periods presented. The Company calculates diluted EPS using the treasury stock method, which reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options at the presented date are exercised and restricted stock unit awards have vested. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   options to purchase Broadridge common stock that would have been anti-dilutive to exclude from the computation of diluted EPS. For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the computation of diluted EPS did not include   0.9 million   options to purchase Broadridge common stock, as the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  
  The following table sets forth the denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations (in millions):

NOTE 6. ACQUISITIONS 
    
  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
    
  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the respective acquisition date based upon the estimated fair values at such date. The results of operations of the business acquired by the Company are included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings since the respective date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to Goodwill. 
    
  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company acquired   one   business in the Investor Communication Solutions segment:  
    
  NACC           
  In July 2016, the Company acquired the assets of NACC, a leading provider of customer communication services including print and digital communication solutions, content management, postal optimization, and fulfillment. This acquisition will expand the Company s existing customer communications business. 
    
  The aggregate purchase price was   $410.0 million   in cash, or   $402.0 million   net of cash acquired and other closing adjustments, and subject further to a customary net working capital adjustment. Net tangible assets acquired in the transaction were   $56.2 million  . This acquisition resulted in   $249.0 million   of Goodwill, which is primarily tax deductible. Intangible assets acquired, which totaled   $96.8 million  , consist primarily of customer relationships and software technology.  The results of NACC s operations were included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q from the date of acquisition.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the NACC purchase price allocation has not yet been finalized, specifically the fair values and the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, as well as finalization of the net working capital adjustment. 
    
  The following summarizes the preliminary allocation of purchase price for the NACC acquisition:

For purposes of this pro forma presentation, the acquisition of NACC is assumed to have occurred on July 1, 2015.   The pro forma financial information for all periods presented also includes the estimated business combination accounting effects resulting from this acquisition, notably amortization expense from the acquired intangible assets (of which the purchase accounting allocation has not yet been finalized) and interest expense from a recent bond offering, the proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisition.  
    
             This unaudited pro forma financial information should not be relied upon as being indicative of the historical results that would have been obtained if the acquisition had actually occurred on July 1, 2015, nor of the results of operations that may be obtained in the future.

NOTE 7. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
           Level 1 
    Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
              Level 2 
    Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
              Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
       
  In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculates the fair value of its Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. 
  The Company holds available-for-sale securities issued by a non-public entity for which the lowest level of significant inputs is unobservable. On a recurring basis, the Company uses pricing models and similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment by management. Accordingly, the Company classifies the available-for-sale securities as Level 3 in the table below. 
  The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the table below. 
  The following tables set forth the Company s financial assets and liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , respectively, that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy:

NOTE 11. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  The activity related to the Company s incentive equity awards for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of the following:   

  ____________ 
     
           (b) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s outstanding vested and currently exercisable stock options using the   September 30, 2016   closing stock price of   $67.79   (approximately   2.9 million   shares) had an aggregate intrinsic value of   $116.0 million   with a weighted-average exercise price of   $27.58   and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of   5.3   years.  The total of all stock options outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   have a weighted-average remaining contractual life of   6.6   years.       
       
           (c) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units expected to vest using the   September 30, 2016   closing stock price of   $67.79   (approximately   1.2 million   and   0.4 million   shares, respectively) had an aggregate intrinsic value of   $78.1 million   and   $29.4 million  , respectively.   
       
           The Company has stock-based compensation plans under which the Company annually grants stock option and restricted stock unit awards.  Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the dates of grant, with the measurement of stock-based compensation expense recognized in Net earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense of   $8.8 million   and   $9.0 million  , as well as related tax benefits of   $3.0 million   and   $3.4 million   were recognized for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock unit awards amounted to   $10.5 million   and   $30.9 million  , respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of   2.4 years   and   1.4 years  , respectively. 
  For stock options issued, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of the Company s stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. 
   
  NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES 
  The provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $17.9 million   and   34.8%  , compared to   $18.1 million   and   35.1%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in the effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily attributable to the recognition in the annualized fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate for the U.S. federal research and development

  NOTE 13. CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  Data Center Agreements 
  In March 2010, the Company and International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the  IT Services Agreement ), under which IBM provides certain aspects of the Company s information technology infrastructure. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provides a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, open systems, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The migration of data center processing to IBM was completed in August 2012. The IT Services Agreement would have expired on June 30, 2022. In March 2015, the Company signed a   two  -year extension to the IT Services Agreement which expires on   June 30, 2024  .  The Company has the right to renew the term of the IT Services Agreement for up to   one   additional   12  -month term. Commitments remaining under this agreement at   September 30, 2016   are   $431.1 million   through fiscal year 2024, the final year of the contract.  
  In March 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited ( IBM UK ) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the  EU IT Services Agreement ), under which IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company s technology outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia. The EU IT Services Agreement expires in October 2023.  The Company has the right to renew the initial term of the EU IT Services Agreement for up to   one   additional   12  -month term or   one   additional   24  -month term.  Commitments remaining under this agreement at   September 30, 2016   are   $28.2 million   through fiscal year 2024, the final year of the contract.  
    
  Equity Method Investment 
    
  The Company contributed   $1.6   million to an equity method investment during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and has a remaining commitment of   $1.5 million   to fund this investment at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Purchase of Intellectual Property  
    
  As discussed in Note 6,  Acquisitions,  the Company expects to pay   $40.0 million   to an affiliate of Inveshare by September 2018 upon delivery of certain new blockchain technology applications.  
    
  Other 
  In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and litigation. While the outcome of any claim or litigation is inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had an outstanding letter of credit for   $1.6 million  . This letter of credit was issued in May 2007 to guarantee certain claim payments to a third-party insurance company in the event the Company does not pay its portion of the claims.   No   amounts were drawn on this letter of credit. 
  It is not the Company s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   or at   June 30, 2016  . 
  In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company s products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties, or collateral arrangements.

NOTE 15. INTERIM FINANCIAL DATA BY SEGMENT 
  The Company classifies its operations into the following   two   reportable segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations. See Note 1,  Basis of Presentation  for a further description of the Company s reportable segments. 
  The primary components of  Other  are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits as well as certain unallocated expenses. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the constant foreign currency exchange rates used for internal management reporting. 
  Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit.

  Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America ( U.S. ). These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements present the condensed consolidated position of the Company and include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest as well as various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under either the cost or equity methods of accounting. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding.   
  The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or any subsequent interim period. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016   in the   2016   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on August 9, 2016. 
  Effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we have revised our presentation in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings to separately present Interest expense, net. Previously, we reported Interest expense, net, as part of Non-operating expenses, net, and did not separately present such amounts in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. All prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation.  
  Effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU No. 2015-03 ), which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The Company has applied this guidance on a retrospective basis and accordingly, the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets have been updated to reflect this new classification. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  In presenting the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment, available information, and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. However, actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. In management s opinion, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position

     Table of Contents  

are discussed in the  Critical Accounting Policies  section of Part II, Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the   2016   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Results of Operations 
  The following discussions of Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments refer to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides a more detailed discussion concerning certain components of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
  The following references are utilized in the discussions of Analysis of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Analysis of Reportable Segments: 
   Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property  and  Acquisition and Integration Costs  represent certain non-cash amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets and purchased intellectual property assets, as well as certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company s acquisition activities. 
   Net New Business  refers to recurring revenue from closed sales less recurring revenue from client losses. 
  The following definitions describe the Company s Revenues: 
  Fee revenues in the Investor Communication Solutions segment are derived from both recurring and event-driven activity. 
  In addition, the level of recurring and event-driven activity we process directly impacts distribution revenues. While event- driven activity is highly repeatable, it may not recur on an annual basis. The types of services we provide that comprise event-driven activity are: 

Mutual Fund Proxy: The proxy and related services we provide to mutual funds when certain events occur requiring a shareholder vote including changes in directors, sub-advisors, fee structures, investment restrictions, and mergers of funds. 
                
    Mutual Fund Communications: Mutual fund communications services consist primarily of the distribution on behalf of mutual funds of supplemental information required to be provided to the annual mutual fund prospectus as a result of certain triggering events such as a change in portfolio managers. In addition, mutual fund communications consist of notices and marketing materials such as newsletters. 
                
    Proxy Contests and Specials, Corporate Actions, and Other: The proxy services we provide in connection with shareholder meetings driven by special events such as proxy contests, mergers and acquisitions, and tender/exchange offers. 
       
  Event-driven fee revenues are based on the number of special events and corporate transactions we process. Event-driven activity is impacted by financial market conditions and changes in regulatory compliance requirements, resulting in fluctuations in the timing and levels of event-driven fee revenues. As such, the timing and level of event-driven activity and its potential impact on revenues and earnings are difficult to forecast. 
    
  Generally, mutual fund proxy activity has been subject to a greater level of volatility than the other components of event- driven activity. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 22% lower compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . During fiscal year 2016, mutual fund proxy fee revenues were 22% higher than the prior fiscal year while during fiscal year 2015, mutual fund proxy revenues were 2% lower than the prior fiscal year, respectively. Although it is difficult to forecast the levels of event-driven activity, we expect that the portion of fee revenues derived from mutual fund proxy activity may continue to experience volatility in the future. 
    
  Distribution revenues primarily include revenues related to the physical mailing of proxy materials, interim communications, transaction reporting, customer communications and fulfillment services, as well as Matrix administrative services. 
    
  Distribution cost of revenues consists primarily of postage-related expenses incurred in connection with our Investor Communication Solutions segment, as well as Matrix administrative services expenses. These costs are reflected in Cost of revenues.

Closed sales represent an estimate of the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts that were signed by Broadridge in the current reporting period. Closed sales does not include event-driven or distribution activity. We consider contract terms, expected client volumes or activity, knowledge of the marketplace and experience with our clients, among other factors, when determining the estimate. Management uses Closed sales to measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs, as an indicator of expected future revenues and as a performance metric in determining incentive compensation.  
  The inherent variability of transaction volumes and activity levels can result in some variability of amounts reported as actual achieved Closed sales. We track actual revenues achieved during the first year that the client contract is fully implemented and compare this to the previously reported Closed sales amount, this process is used to calibrate metrics used in incentive compensation and will be used to estimate future allowance adjustments. Larger Closed sales can take up to 12 to 24 months or longer to convert to revenues, particularly for the services provided by our Global Technology and Operations segment. Beginning in the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2017  , we will report Closed sales net of an allowance adjustment, in lieu of adjusting for actual performance in subsequent periods. Consequently, beginning in fiscal year 2017, Closed sales amounts will not be adjusted for actual revenues achieved since these adjustments are estimated in the period they are reported. 
  Closed sales is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or other income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses Closed sales as a metric for planning and analyzing the Company s financial results and believes it is useful to investors, as a supplement to the corresponding GAAP measure, in understanding how management measures and evaluates our ongoing operational performance. 
  Closed Sales 
  Closed sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $21.7 million  ,   an increase   of   $4.4 million  , or   26%  , compared to   $17.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , which includes contributions from NACC.

     Table of Contents  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   versus   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Revenues.   Revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $895.3 million  ,   an increase   of   $300.6 million  , or   51%  , compared to   $594.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Revenues from acquisitions contributed $277.7 million of this total increase, with NACC revenues contributing $272.4 million. The   $300.6 million     increase   was driven by higher distribution revenues of   $181.0 million  , or   103%  , which includes $166.3 million of NACC distribution revenues and higher recurring fee revenues of   $124.2 million  , or   32%  . The higher recurring fee revenues of   $124.2 million   reflected: contributions from our recent acquisitions (28pts), primarily from the NACC acquisition, and gains from Net New Business (4pts). Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues by   $4.1 million  , or (1%).  
  Total Operating Expenses  .   Total operating expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $829.3 million  ,   an increase   of   $293.6 million  , or   55%  , compared to   $535.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Cost of revenues   increase  d by   $279.4 million  , or   64%  , and Selling, general and administrative expenses   increase  d by   $14.2 million  , or   15%  . 
  Cost of revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $717.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $279.4 million  , or   64%  , compared to   $438.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased cost of fee revenues by $4.5 million. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $111.3 million  ,   an increase   of   $14.2 million  , or   15%  , compared to   $97.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions.  
  Operating income.     Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $66.0 million, an increase of $7.0 million, or 12%, compared to $59.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses including $4.7 million of increased amortization of acquired intangibles and purchased intellectual property. Operating income margins decreased to 7.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 9.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of NACC. 
  Interest expense, net.   Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $10.4 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 68%, compared to $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $3.9 million from higher Long-term borrowings.   
  Other non-operating expenses, net.    Other non-operating expenses, net for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $4.2 million  , an increase of $  3.0 million  , or   250%  , compared to   $1.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to higher expense of $2.7 million related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
  Earnings before Income Taxes  .   Earnings before income taxes for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $51.5 million  ,   a decrease   of   $0.1 million  , compared to   $51.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
  Provision for Income Taxes  .   The Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $17.9 million   and   34.8%  , compared to   $18.1 million   and   35.1%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015 is primarily attributable to the recognition in the annualized fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate for the U.S. federal research and development (R D) tax credit and the U.S. federal Section 199 domestic production activities deduction, neither of which were recognized in the corresponding three month period ended September 30, 2015.    
  Net Earnings and Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share  .    Net earnings for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $33.7 million  ,   an increase   of   $0.2 million  , or 1%, compared to   $33.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The   increase   in Net earnings primarily reflects higher revenues as discussed above. 
  Basic and Diluted earnings per share for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   $0.28   and   $0.28  , respectively, compared to   $0.28   and   $0.28   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  Analysis of Reportable Segments 
  The Company classifies its operations into the following two reportable segments: Investor Communication Solutions and Global Technology and Operations. 
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

The primary components of  Other  are the elimination of intersegment revenues and profits and certain unallocated expenses. Foreign currency exchange is a reconciling item between the actual foreign currency exchange rates and the fiscal year 2015 budgeted foreign currency exchange rates reflected in the segments. 
  Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts in a reasonable manner. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment-related expense items in Other rather than reflect such items in segment profit. 
  Revenues 

Earnings Before Income Taxes 

Investor Communication Solutions 
  Revenues      

  Revenues  . Investor Communication Solutions segment s Revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $723.3 million  ,   an increase   of   $293.6 million  , or   68%  , compared to   $429.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Revenues from acquisitions contributed $274.3 million of this total increase, with NACC revenues contributing $272.4 million. The   $293.6 million     increase   was driven by: (i) an increase in distribution revenues of   $181.0 million  , or   103%  , and (ii)  
  
   28 

     Table of Contents  

higher recurring fee revenues contributed   $113.2 million  , or   52%  , primarily NACC recurring fee revenue, partially offset by (iii) lower event-driven fee revenues of $0.5 million, or (1%).  
  The higher recurring fee revenues of   $113.2 million   reflected: (i) contributions from our recent acquisitions (50pts), including (49pts) from the NACC acquisition; and (ii) Net New Business from increases in revenues from Closed sales (3pts); which were partially offset by (iii) negative internal growth as a result of a decline in the volume of processed pieces (-1pts). Lower event-driven fee revenues were the result of decreased equity proxy specials and corporate actions communications activity. 
    
  Position growth compared to the same period in the prior year, which is a component of internal growth, was 1% for mutual fund interims and 1% for annual equity proxy communications.  Although these indicators were positive, the first three months  results are not necessarily indicative of our full-year results due to the seasonality of our business.  
  Earnings before Income Taxes  . Earnings before income taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were $32.9 million,   a decrease   of   $1.1 million  , or   3%  , compared to $33.9 million for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The earnings decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses, including higher distribution and amortization expenses, which more than offset the impact of higher revenues. Pre-tax margins   decreased   by   3.4   percentage points to   4.5%  , this was primarily due to the acquisition of NACC.  
  Global Technology and Operations 
  Revenues  . Global Technology and Operations segment s Revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were $  187.8 million  ,   an increase   of   $11.1 million  , or   6%  , compared to   $176.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The 6% increase was attributable to: (i) higher Net New Business from Closed sales (4pts) and (ii) revenue from recent acquisitions (2pts). 
  Earnings before Income Taxes  . Earnings before income taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $38.3 million  ,   an increase   of   $8.0 million  , or   26%  , compared to   $30.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The earnings increase was primarily due to higher organic Net New Business revenues and cost management initiatives, partially offset by the impact of recent acquisitions. 
  Pre-tax margins   increased   by   3.2   percentage points to   20.4%  .  
  Other 
  Loss before Income Taxes.   Loss before income taxes was   $22.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $8.9 million  , compared to   $13.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increased loss was primarily due to an increase in interest expense, net of $4.1 million, and increased foreign currency transaction losses. 
   
  Explanation and Reconciliation of the Company s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The Company s results in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP except where otherwise noted. In certain circumstances, results have been presented that are not generally accepted accounting principles measures ( Non-GAAP ). These Non-GAAP measures are Adjusted Operating income, Adjusted Net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share, and Free cash flow. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company s reported results. 
    
  The Company believes our Non-GAAP financial measures help investors understand how management plans, measures and evaluates the Company s business performance. Management believes that Non-GAAP measures provide consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors  understanding of the Company s operating results and trends by providing an additional basis for comparison. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. In addition, and as a consequence of the importance of these Non-GAAP financial measures in managing our business, the Company s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors incorporates Non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation process for determining management compensation. 

29 

     Table of Contents  

Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share 
    
  These Non-GAAP measures reflect Operating income, Operating income margin, Net earnings, and Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, and Acquisition and Integration Costs. Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property represents non-cash expenses associated with the Company's acquisition activities. Acquisition and Integration Costs represent certain transaction and integration costs associated with the Company s acquisition activities.  We exclude Amortization of Acquired Intangibles and Purchased Intellectual Property, and Acquisition and Integration Costs from these measures because excluding such information provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business and these items do not reflect ordinary operations or earnings. Management believes these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. 
    
  Free Cash Flow 
    
  In addition to the Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, we provide Free cash flow information because we consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated that could be used for dividends, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Free cash flow is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is defined by the Company as Net cash flows provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures as well as Software purchases and capitalized internal use software. 
               
           Set forth below is a reconciliation of such Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures (unaudited):

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following: 

At   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents were   $227.4 million   and Total stockholders  equity was   $1,051.3 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , net working capital was   $244.0 million  , compared to   $596.2 million   at   June 30, 2016  . At the current time, and in future periods, we expect cash generated by our operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividends and common stock repurchases. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , $86.8 million of the   $227.4 million   of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries, and $54.8 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by regulated entities. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt repayment schedules, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations, as we consider these funds to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. 
  Outstanding borrowings and available capacity under the Company s borrowing arrangements were as follows:

(a) On July 1, 2016, the Company has adopted ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective basis and accordingly, the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2016 has been updated to reflect this new classification, which resulted in a decrease in Other non-current assets of $7.1 million, a decrease in Long-term debt, excluding current portion of $7.0 million and a decrease of $0.1 million in Current portion of long-term debt at June 30, 2016. 
  The Company has a $750.0 million five-year revolving credit facility (the  Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility ), which is comprised of a $670.0 million U.S. dollar tranche and an $80.0 million multicurrency tranche. Borrowings under the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. In addition, the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility has an annual facility fee equal to 12.5 basis points on the entire facility, which totaled   $0.2 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $110.0 million   outstanding borrowings and had unused available capacity of $640.0 million under the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. The facility is scheduled to expire in August 2019. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value of the Company s outstanding Long-term debt was   $1,125.8 million  , consisting of: (i) borrowings on the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility of   $110.0 million  , (ii) senior notes of   $124.9 million   ($125.0 million principal amount less $0.1 million bond discount) due June 2017, (iii) senior notes of   $397.3 million   ($400.0 million principal amount less $0.3 million bond discount and $2.4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due September 2020 and (iv) senior notes of $493.6 million ($500.0 million principal amount less $2.0 million bond discount and $4.4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs) due June 2026. The Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility and the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are ranked equally in right of payment. Interest on the senior notes due 2017 is payable semiannually on June 1  st   and December 1  st   each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6.125%. Interest on the senior notes due 2020 is payable semiannually on March 1  st   and September 1  st   each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.95%. Interest on the senior notes due 2026 is payable semiannually on June 27  th   and December 27  th   each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 3.40%.  
  Our liquidity position may be negatively affected by changes in general economic conditions, regulatory requirements and access to the capital markets, which may be limited if we were to fail to renew any of the credit facilities on their renewal dates or if we were to fail to meet certain ratios.

Cash Flows 

The increase in cash used in operating activities of $62.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to the relative increase in working capital of $54.7 million, which includes a receivable from DST Systems, Inc. related to the transition of NACC cash collection activities, and lower income tax accruals. 
  The decrease in Free cash flow of $59.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, was driven by an increase in Net cash flows used in operating activities of $62.8 million, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures and purchases of intangibles of $3.1 million. 
  The increase in cash used in investing activities of $490.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily reflects increased investments of $402.0 million in acquisitions and $90.0 million in purchased intellectual property. 
  The increased cash provided by financing activities of $82.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflects cash provided by: (i) an increase in net proceeds from borrowings of $65.0 million, (ii) a $38.3 million increase in the proceeds from stock options, and (iii) a $19.5 million increase in excess tax benefits from the issuance of stock-based compensation awards, partially offset by cash used: (i) a $37.0 million increase in the purchase of common stock and (ii) a $3.5 million increase in dividends paid. 
   
  Seasonality 
  Processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter (the second quarter of the calendar year). The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds. Historically, this has caused our revenues, operating income, net earnings, and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter. The seasonality of our revenues makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific fiscal quarter and could affect an investor s ability to compare our   financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on a fiscal quarter-by-quarter basis. 
   
  Income Taxes   
  Our effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   34.8%  , compared to   35.1%   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily attributable to the recognition in the annualized fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate for the U.S. federal research and development (R D) tax credit and the U.S. federal Section 199 domestic production activities deduction, neither of which were recognized in the corresponding three month period ended   September 30, 2015  .

Contractual Obligations 
  In March 2010, the Company and International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the  IT Services Agreement ), under which IBM provides certain aspects of the Company s information technology infrastructure. Under the IT Services Agreement, IBM provides a broad range of technology services to the Company including supporting its mainframe, midrange, open systems, network and data center operations, as well as providing disaster recovery services. The Company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time. The migration of data center processing to IBM was completed in August 2012.  The IT Services Agreement would have expired on June 30, 2022. In March 2015, the Company signed a two-year extension to the IT Services Agreement which expires on   June 30, 2024  .  The Company has the right to renew the term of the IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term.  Commitments remaining under this agreement at   September 30, 2016   are   $431.1 million   through fiscal year 2024, the final year of the contract. 
  In March 2014, the Company and IBM United Kingdom Limited ( IBM UK ) entered into an Information Technology Services Agreement (the  EU IT Services Agreement ), under which IBM UK provides data center services supporting the Company s business process outsourcing services for certain clients in Europe and Asia. The EU IT Services Agreement expires in October 2023. The Company has the right to renew the initial term of the EU IT Services Agreement for up to one additional 12-month term or one additional 24-month term. Commitments remaining under this agreement at   September 30, 2016   are   $28.2 million   through fiscal year 2024, the final year of the contract.

Other Commercial Agreements 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had   $110.0 million   of outstanding borrowings and unused available capacity of $640.0 million under the Fiscal 2015 Revolving Credit Facility. 
  Certain of the Company s subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. There were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 
  It is not the Company s business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   or at June 30, 2016. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company s products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties or collateral arrangements.
