NOTE
1: GENERAL:   

A.  
      EZTD Inc. ( the Company ) was incorporated in April 2002 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On June 3, 2015, the Company reincorporated in Delaware. The Company is engaged in the business of offering online trading of binary options and forex, enabling trading on contracts for differences in shares, indices, commodities and foreign exchanges. The Company s shares were quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace in the United States under the symbol  EZTD  from 2010 until August 2013, when the Company terminated its registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as a result the Company s shares were quoted on the OTC Pink. The Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) a Form 10, which became effective on August 31, 2015 and on October 30, 2015 the Company was officially quoted again on the OTCQB Marketplace. On December 30, 2015, the Company upgraded to be officially quoted in the OTCQX Marketplace.   

The Company conducts its operations and business with and through its active wholly-owned subsidiaries, (a) Win Global Markets Inc. (Israel) Ltd., an Israeli company, (b) WGM Services Ltd., a company registered in Cyprus ( WGM ), (c) EZ Invest Securities Ltd., a Japanese corporation, (d) SCGP Investments Limited, a Belizean company, (e) EZTD Australia PTY Ltd., an Australian company, and (f) EZ Trader, Ltd, a company registered in Vanuatu. On January 26, 2015, the Company changed its name from EZ Trader, Inc. to EZTD Inc.   

B.  
      The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net loss attributable to the Company was $11.5 million and the negative cash flows from operations were $4.9 million. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s obligations to customers amounted to $2.39 million, while current assets were $4.7 million. Customers may withdraw their deposits upon demand. According to regulatory requirements in Cyprus, WGM is required to maintain capital of at least  730 thousand and have funds exceeding client obligations. Funds consist of cash, segregated client cash accounts, restricted cash and receivables from credit card companies. Despite its negative cash flows, the Company has been able to secure financing to support its operations to date based on share issuances and loans. The Company plans to seek additional funds from equity issuances in order to continue its operations and to leverage its binary options business. Although there is a substantial doubt that the Company will continue as a going concern, the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.   

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim
financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the
Company. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
consolidated financial statements comprise the results and position of the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is the power
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its operating activities. In assessing
control, legal and contractual rights are taken into account. The consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries are included
in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control is achieved until the date that control ceases. Intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.  

Reclassifications   

Clearance
expenses in the comparative figures have been reclassified from sales and marketing expenses to finance expenses to conform to
the current presentation.  

Following
the Company's reverse stock split, described in note 6, the comparative loss per share for the period of nine and three months
ended September 30, 2015 was amended from $(0.04) to $(1.16), and from $(0.01) to $(0.36), respectively.  

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: (Cont.):   

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements:   

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which revises the guidance in ASC 718,  Compensation
- Stock Compensation , and will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees, including
the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The guidance is effective for reporting
periods (interim and annual) beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which establishes the principles to report transparent
and economically neutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. This guidance results in a more
faithful representation of the rights and obligations arising from operating and capital leases by requiring lessees to recognize
the lease assets and lease liabilities that arise from leases in the statement of financial position and to disclose qualitative
and quantitative information about lease transactions, such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew
and terminate leases. This guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of this guidance.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10)  ( ASU
2016-01 ), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently assessing the potential
impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial statements - Going concern (subtopic 205-40), Disclosure
of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . The new standard provides guidance on management s
responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern
and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the
date the financial statements are issued. ASU 2014-15 applies prospectively to annual periods ending after December 15, 2016,
and to annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE
3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT:   

The
Company measures fair value and discloses fair value measurements for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair
value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date.  

The
accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair
value into three broad levels, which are described below:  

Level
1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.  

Level
2 : Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.  

Level
3 : Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority
to Level 3 inputs.  

In
determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value.  

NOTE
3 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (Cont.):   

Items
carried at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are classified in the table below in one of the three categories
described above.  

The
Company measures changes in the fair value of  long term options  (classified as financial liabilities) through profit
or loss using valuation techniques.  

Total
gain for the period recognized in earnings amounted to $1,853 thousand and total unrealized gain related to those financial liabilities
at the end of the period recognized in earnings amounted to $392 thousand. All instruments were issued during the period and no
transfers took place into or out of Level 3 during the period.  

The
following table summarizes the Level 3 roll-forward:  

This
fair value measurement of the derivatives in the table above is based on significant unobservable inputs (other than quoted prices
in active markets that are observable for liability) and thus represent a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
The key inputs used in measuring the fair value of financial liabilities depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of
the underlying instrument, and include: risk-free interest rates, quoted foreign exchange rates, quoted market prices, contractual
life of the derivative and expected volatility based on past experience.  

The
Company s financial liabilities are evaluated on a quarterly basis by the Company s Finance Department based upon
the Rubenstein and Reiner pricing model for cash-or-nothing options in determining fair value. These evaluations are independently
reviewed on an annual basis by an independent third party. Any changes in fair value of financial liabilities are recorded in
the consolidated statement of operations. Changes in fair value of financial liability are recorded in consolidated statement
of operations.  

The
measurement of financial liabilities classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy is evaluated by the head of the Company s
risk department and the Company s Chief Financial Officer. Measurements deemed necessary are reviewed by the Board of Directors.

The
following section describes the ranges of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in Level 3 fair value measurements.
The level of aggregation and the diversity of instruments held by the Company lead to a wide range of unobservable inputs that
may not be evenly distributed across the Level 3 liabilities.   

  Volatility
generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract. Volatilities
for certain combinations of tenor and strike price are not observable. Generally, as the volatility increases in the long term
positions the value of the derivative increases; the inverse is also true. Some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility
than others. For example, an at-the-money option would experience a larger percentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money
option. In addition, the fair value of an option with more than one underlying security depends on the volatility of the individual
underlying securities. Specific volatility inputs vary widely by asset type. For example, ranges for foreign exchange volatility
are generally lower and narrower than equity volatility. Equity instruments (stock) volatilities are wider due to the nature of
the stock market and the terms of certain exotic instruments. For most instruments, the interest rate volatility input is on the
lower end of the range; however, for certain structured or exotic instruments (such as market-linked asset or exotic interest
rate derivatives), the range is much wider. Volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key
factor in pricing options. Typically, instruments can become more expensive if volatility increases. For example, as an index
becomes more volatile, the cost to maintaining a given level of exposure increases because more frequent rebalancing of the portfolio
is required.     

NOTE 4 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET:   

The Company
capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software development once a project has reached the application development stage.
Such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the software. Capitalization of such
costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete
and is ready for its intended purpose. The net book value of capitalized costs associated with internal-use software was $2.18
million as of September 30, 2016 and$1.59 million as of December 31, 2015. Once the internal-use software is ready for its intended
use, the assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over each asset s estimated useful life, which is generally three
years.  

During the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, the Company reclassified the net book value of capitalized costs associated with internal-use
software from property and equipment, net to intangible assets, net in the amount mentioned above. In addition, the Company
identified and corrected an error in accounting for the costs of software developed for internal use regarding capitalization
of some costs not in accordance with ASC 350-40-15, in the amount of $507 thousand. On the other hand, the Company recorded
depreciation expenses in the amount of $243  thousand due to costs that were capitalized in accordance with the above ASC,
but before the application development stage was finished. Therefore, the net effect is that the Company recorded, in its
condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, additional
depreciation expenses in the net amount of $265 thousand. The net effect   on the Company's condensed consolidated statement
of comprehensive income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 amounted to $350  thousand, which the Company evaluated
and determined  did not have an impact that was  material to its results of operations, financial position or cash
flows in previously issued financial statements.    

Note 5 - Convertible
loanS:   

A. 

On February 13 and 27, 2014, the Company entered
        into a Convertible Loan Agreement with some of its shareholders and new investors, in which it borrowed an aggregate amount of
        $2.8 million. The loans are convertible into a total of 265,451 (in fixed dollar conversion price and fixed Euro - Dollar currency
        exchange rate) common shares of the Company. Some of the loans are indexed to the Euro, and all of the loans bear interest at an
        annual rate of 10%. The Company shall repay the loan amount and the interest, in one lump sum, on the  Final Repayment Day ,
        which is 12 months after the applicable closing date or, if extended by the lender, 24 months from the applicable closing date. 
           
         The Company recorded issuance costs of approximately
        $154 thousand, which are amortized using the effective rate of the loan over the loan period. As of September 30, 2016, all the
        deferred issuance costs were recorded in the Statements of Operations. 
             
         In 2015, the Company repaid $408 thousand of the February 2014 loans
        and $364 thousand of the February 2014 loans were converted into 34,686 shares of common stock. The remaining $2 million in loans
        were extended for one additional year to be repaid with interest in February 2016, in consideration of the issuance of an additional
        42,857 warrants at an exercise price of $10.50 per share. In April 2016, $500 thousand of the February 2014 loans were repaid.
        In March 2016,  364 thousand of the February 2014 loans were converted into 55,556 shares of common stock. 
           
         In March 2016, the Company and one of the lenders
        under the Convertible Loan Agreement dated February 13, 2014 agreed to extend the payment date of $1 million, under the same terms
        until February 13, 2017 with a yearly interest rate of 5%. In addition, one of the lenders under the Convertible Loan Agreement
        dated February 27, 2014, elected to convert $500 thousand into 55,556 shares of common stock of the Company. 
           
         On April 7, 2016, the Company repaid one of the February 2014 convertible
        loans plus interest in the amount of $590 thousand. 
           
         As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding loan
        balance amounted to $1 million. 
           
         The Company determined that the convertible
        loans do not fall within the scope of ASC 480-10. The embedded conversion feature and the extension clause should not be bifurcated
        in accordance with ASC 815. In addition, the Company followed ASC 470-20 to determine whether a beneficial conversion feature exists
        at loan inception and came to the conclusion that a beneficial conversion feature should not be recognized.   

B.  
     
         On January 29, 2016, the Company entered into
        a convertible loan agreement pursuant to which the lender loaned the Company the principal amount of $1.436 million. The loan,
        which amount is indexed to the GBP, matures in January 2017, and bears an annual interest rate of 12%, to be paid together with
        the outstanding principal in one lump sum. The loan is convertible into 249,967 shares of common stock of the Company. As of September
        30, 2016, the outstanding loan balance amounted to $1.305 million due to the decreased exchange rate of the GBP relative to the
        U.S. dollar. 
           
         The Company determined that the convertible
loans do not fall within the scope of ASC 480-10. The embedded conversion feature and the extension clause should not be bifurcated
in accordance with ASC 815. In addition, the Company followed ASC 470-20 to determine whether a beneficial conversion feature
exists at loan inception and came to the conclusion that a beneficial conversion feature should not be recognized.    

NOTE
6   -  CONTINGENCIES:   

A.  
      On
    June 17, 2015, Feyenoord Rotterdam N.V. ( Feyenoord ) instituted an arbitration proceeding against the Company
    before the Netherlands Arbitration Institute in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. On April 6, 2016, the arbitral tribunal issued
    the award which stated that the agreement between the Company and Feyenoord was terminated and dissolved as of January 27,
    2015, and both parties share responsibility for this termination. In view of this conclusion, a provision was included in
    the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company appealed to revert this decision on July 6, 2016.   

B.  
      On January 11, 2016, the Company received a written  Wells Notice  from SEC staff (the  Staff )
indicating its preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an action against the Company for violations of certain
federal securities laws primarily related to its binary options platform. A Wells Notice is neither a formal allegation of wrongdoing
nor a finding that any violations of law have occurred. Rather, it provides the Company with an opportunity to respond to issues
raised by the Staff and offer its perspective prior to any Commission decision to institute proceedings. On February 3, 2016, the
Company submitted a written submission to the Staff setting forth reasons why the proposed enforcement should not be filed. See
also note 8 below.   

C.  
      The
    Company evaluates estimated losses for indemnifications due to product infringement under FASB Topic ASC 450,  Contingencies. 
    At this time, it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification clauses due to lack
    of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification
    agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, the Company has not incurred material costs as a result
    of obligations under these agreements and has not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in the
    Company s financial statements.   

NOTE
7  - SHARE CAPITAL:   

A.  
       On
        February 11, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors and stockholders approved (1) an amendment to the Company s
        Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the Company s authorized Common Stock from 300,000,000 shares, with a par
        value of $0.001 per share, to 10,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.03 per share (the  Amendment ), and
        (2) a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, such that each
        30 shares of Common Stock held by stockholders of record on April 7, 2016 will be combined into one share of Common Stock,
        except to the extent that such actions result in any of the Company s stockholders holding a fractional share of
        Common Stock (in which instance, because such stockholder s number of shares is not evenly divisible by the 30:1
        ratio, such stockholder will be automatically entitled to receive an additional fraction of a share of common stock to
        round up to the next whole share) (the  Reverse Stock Split ).  
             
         On April 7, 2016, the Reverse Stock
Split became effective. The number of shares options, warrants, per share data and exercise prices included in these financial
statements for all periods presented have been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.    

B.  
      During
    the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted 86,000 options to employees in accordance with the terms and
    conditions of the Company s 2004 Global Share Option Plan.   

C.  
       On
        March 31, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Compagnie Financiere St. Exupery Sicav-Sif,
        as purchaser, providing for the issuance and sale by the Company to the purchaser, in a private placement, of an aggregate
        of 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $6.00 per share, corresponding to an aggregate purchase
        price of $6 million, and a warrant to purchase up to an additional 888,889 shares of the Company s common stock
        at an exercise price of $6.75 per share, which is exercisable 6 months after the closing.  
             
          During
the third quarter of 2016, several investors exercised 208,333 warrants into shares of common stock, for which the Company received
$500 thousand in cash.

NOTE
9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:   

The Company entered into a convertible loan
agreement with Finandrea S.P.A., as lender, dated as of October 10, 2016, pursuant to which the lender loaned the Company the
principal amount of $1.1 million. The loan matures in October 2017, and bears an annual interest rate of 8%, to be paid together
with the outstanding principal in one lump sum. The loan is convertible into 160,025 shares of common stock of the Company. In
addition the Company issued to one of its investors 16,667 warrants at an exercise price of $6.00 per share, to expire 5 years
from the date of issuance.  

  On
October 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement dated as of October 19, 2016 (the  Subscription Agreement )
with WinnerOption Ltd., a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel ( WinnerOption ), providing
for the issuance and sale by WinnerOption to the Company, in a private placement, of an aggregate of 4,996 Ordinary Shares of
WinnerOption stock, or approximately 19.99% of WinnerOption s outstanding Ordinary Shares (collectively, the  Shares )
valued at approximately $1,000,000, in exchange for the Company s contribution of: (i) certain of its intellectual property
relating to social gaming technology, and (ii) payment of $276,000 in cash to WinnerOption at such times after the date of the
Subscription Agreement as determined by the Company in consultation with WinnerOption. As a result of its acquisition of the Shares,
the Company is subject to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement of WinnerOption (the  Shareholders Agreement ),
which includes customary terms and provisions governing the Company s ownership of the Shares, including restrictions on
transferability of the Shares. The Shareholders Agreement also entitles the Company to designate one out of the four directors
to serve on WinnerOption s board of directors.   

  Shimon
Citron, the Company s CEO, is the current controlling shareholder and a director of WinnerOption. The terms of the transaction
between the Company and WinnerOption were approved by a Special Committee of the Company s Board of Directors of which Mr.
Citron was not a member.   

  The
net book value of capitalized costs of  the  intellectual property relating to social gaming technology described above  as
of September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015 are $327,000 and $248,000, respectively.      

 On February 3, 2016, with respect to the matter
described in Note 5.B., the Company submitted a written submission to the Staff setting forth reasons why the proposed enforcement
should not be filed. Subsequently, the Company determined to make an offer of settlement, without an admission or denial of liability,
and that offer was accepted by the SEC on November 10, 2016. On that same date, and in connection with the settlement, an Administrative
Court of the SEC issued an order (the  Order ) that the binary options sold by the Company to U.S. customers between
2011 and 2014, and that the Company s failure to register its binary options or register as a broker-dealer, were violations
of U.S. securities laws. The Order also provided that certain disclosures to the Company s customers regarding the binary
option platform were inadequate. The Order did not contain any findings of fraud. The Wells Notice, settlement offer and Order
do not relate to the current business operations of the Company. EZTD had closed its platform to new U.S. customers in January
of 2014, and by the end of the third quarter of 2014, the Company had prohibited existing U.S. customers from making additional
deposits to their accounts. Accordingly, the SEC proceedings concerned only historical business operations. The Order censures
the Company, and requires that it cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section
10(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Order further
requires that the Company pay disgorgement fees of $1,515,858 reflecting revenues earned during the period in which the Company
operated its binary option platform in the United States, together with prejudgment interest of $57,691 and a civil monetary penalty
in the amount of $200,000 to the SEC, in twelve monthly installments, within one year from the Order Date. The Company will make
its first payment of $147,796 by November 20, 2016, and starting the second month after the Order Date, the Company will pay the
remaining eleven monthly installments of $147,796 on the last date of each month. A proper provision was previously included in
the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

Overview    

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (in thousands) and are prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  

You
should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Our
Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 23, 2002. On June 3, 2015, the Company reincorporated
in Delaware. Effective as of January 26, 2015, we changed our name from EZTrader, Inc. to EZTD Inc.  

We are engaged in
the business of offering online trading of binary options and forex, enabling trading on contracts for differences in shares,
indices, commodities and foreign exchanges. We conduct our operations and business with and through our wholly owned subsidiaries:
(a) Win Global Markets Inc. (Israel) Ltd., an Israeli company, (b) WGM Services Ltd., a company registered in Cyprus ( WGM ),
(c) EZ Invest Securities Ltd., a Japanese corporation, (d) SCGP Investments Limited, a Belizean company, (e) EZTD Australia PTY
Ltd., an Australian company, and (f) EZ Trader, Ltd., a company registered in Vanuatu. Trading is being offered by WGM on http://www.eztrader.com,
http://www.globaloption.com, and http://www.ezinvest.com. Information contained
on, or that can be accessed through, our websites does not constitute a part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we have
included our website addresses in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q solely as inactive textual references.  

We
have developed and currently operate an online trading platform for retail customers to trade a wide range of binary options internationally
with more than 100 different assets including indices, international stocks, commodities and currency pairs ( Trading Platform ).  

The Trading Platform enables retail customers
to trade binary options in more than 30 countries. The self-developed, proprietary Trading Platform is accessible from multiple
operating systems and the internet. The Trading Platform has been designed to be as intuitive and as easy to use as possible,
and is localized into eleven languages. We believe that our emphasis on technology, together with targeted online marketing strategy,
has helped to differentiate us from our competitors. Although our business focuses primarily on Europe and Japan, we would like
to expand in the United States using approved regulatory pathways.  

We
conduct our operations from four offices which are located in Nicosia, Cyprus, Tel-Aviv, Israel, London, England and Tokyo, Japan.
We manage risk in a number of ways, in particular by limiting financial exposure to any individual customer to a relatively low
level as well as limiting exposure to any individual asset. We generate our revenues principally from the margin between winning
customers and losing customers. We do not charge customers a commission on trades.  

In
February 2016, our Board of Directors and stockholders approved (1) an amendment to the Company s certificate of Incorporation
to reduce the Company s authorized Common Stock from 300,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.001 per share, to 10,000,000
shares, with a par value of $0.03 per share, or the Amendment, and (2) a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of the Company s issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock, such that each 30 shares of Common Stock held by stockholders of record on April 7, 2016
was combined into one share of Common Stock, except to the extent that such actions resulted in any of the Company s stockholders
holding a fractional share of Common Stock (in which instance, because such stockholder s number of shares is not evenly
divisible by the 1:30 ratio, such stockholder is entitled to receive an additional fraction of a share of Common Stock to round
up to the next whole share), or the Reverse Stock Split.  

The Board determined that it was in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders to reduce the number of outstanding shares of its Common Stock as part of its intention
to list the Company s shares of Common Stock on the NASDAQ and the corresponding requirements. In order to initially list
the Company s shares on NASDAQ, its Common Stock must have a closing price of at least $3.00 per share. On November 16,
2016, the closing price of our Common Stock was $2.10 per share.  

Selected
Financial Information   

We calculate the average revenue per user,
or ARPU, by dividing the total revenues for the period by the total number of current active users. Current active users are defined
as customers who performed at least one deposit or one transaction within the past seven months from the reported period. We had
revenues net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $4,545 and $6,947, respectively, while the number of active
users for those periods was 11,567 and 15,461, respectively. As a result, the ARPU for those periods was $393 and $449, respectively. 

We
had revenues net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $16,509 and $19,492, respectively, while the number
of active users for those periods was 40,499 and 42,124, respectively. As a result, the ARPU for those periods was $408 and $463,
respectively. We measured these metrics in order to track the difference in ARPU and to change our marketing strategy accordingly,
if needed, during the year.  

We
calculate the average user acquisition cost, or AUAC, which cost is included as part of our sales and marketing expenses, by dividing
the total acquisition costs by the total number of active users for any given period. Total acquisition costs for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,637 and $3,723, respectively. As a result, the AUAC for those periods was $142 and $241,
respectively.  

We had total acquisition costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $9,499 and $9,931, respectively.
As a result, the AUAC for those periods was $235 and $236, respectively. We measured these metrics in order to track the difference
in AUAC and to change our marketing strategy accordingly, as needed, throughout the year.   

We ascertain the return on investment, or
ROI, by dividing the ARPU by AUAC in order to track fluctuations in the ratio. The ROI for the three months ended September 30,
2016 was 2.78 as compared to an ROI of 1.87 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The ROI for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was 1.74 as compared to an ROI of 1.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

This
discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Revenues
and Cost of Revenues   

During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, we mainly generated revenues from our binary options business.  

Total revenues for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 decreased by 15.3% to $16,509 from $19,492 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Total revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 34.58% to $4,545 from $6,947 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decreases
for the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2016 are mainly attributable to a significant increase in withdrawals
of customers as a result of new regulations imposed by our Cypriot regulator, as well as a decrease in our marketing expenses
to improve ROI and re-focus on our core business in Europe.  

Trading volume for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $107.3 million
and $61.8 million, respectively. Trading volume for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $25.2 million and $21
million, respectively. Revenues as a percentage of trading volume for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 15.4%
and 31.5%, respectively. Revenues as a percentage of trading volume for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
18.0% and 33.1%, respectively. These decreases are due to a decrease in our sales and marketing expenses to improve ROI.  

The ARPU for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was $393 and $449, respectively. The ARPU for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $408 and
$463, respectively. 

The AUAC for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 was $142 and $241, respectively. The AUAC for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $235 and
$236, respectively. 

The ROI for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 2.78 and 1.87, respectively. The ROI for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 1.74 and 1.96, respectively.  

Sales
and Marketing   

Our
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of traffic acquisition costs, which are paid to our affiliate partners, media and
advertising companies, as well as compensation and related expenses for marketing personnel.  

Total sales and marketing expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 7.5% to $16,261 from $15,132 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Selling
and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 17.4 % to $4,625, compared to $5,601 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. These changes in sales and marketing expenses are attributable to a decrease in user traffic
expenses in order to improve ROI in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Research
and Development   

Our
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for our software development personnel,
outsourced labor and expenses for testing new versions of our software.  

Research and development expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 23.9% to $591 from $477 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Research
and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 12.5% to $1,531 from $1,361 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. These increases are mainly attributed to expenses related to improvement of our online trading platform.  

General
and Administrative   

Our
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for executive, accounting, legal, human
resources and administrative personnel, professional fees and other general corporate expenses.  

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 102.9% to $6,500 from $3,202 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by
66.2% to $2,264 from $1,362 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 is mainly attributable to a significant increase in legal expenses, mainly due to the outcome of the arbitration related
to the Feyenoord as described in Note 5 to the Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, an increase in payroll, an increase in depreciation expenses due to investment in our platform, and additional costs due
to the expansion of operations in our Cyprus and Japanese offices, and the opening of new offices in London. The increase for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 is mainly attributable to expansion of operations in our Cyprus and Japanese offices,
and the opening of new offices in London.  

In addition, we made a provision of $1,500,000 relating to a legal settlement
in connection with an SEC investigation as further described in Note 5B to the Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This matter has now been settled. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements included in Part
I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Financial
Expenses   

Our financial expenses, net for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 were $93 compared to the financial expenses of $312 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Our financial expenses, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,483 compared to the financial expenses of $2,229
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in financial expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016
are mainly due to the decrease of loan interest and variability in exchange rates. The decreases in financial expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 are mainly attributable to the grant of warrants recorded in the first half of 2015.  

Net
Loss Attributable to the Company   

Net loss attributable to the Company for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $11,527 compared to a net loss of 3,711 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,220 compared to a net loss of $1,174 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Net loss per share from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was
$2.49 and $1.16, respectively. Net loss per share from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September
30, 2015 was $0.64 and $0.36, respectively. Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly attributable
to legal expenses in advance of the settlement with the SEC, the settlement with Feyenoord and the expenses attributed to our
expansion into the Japanese market, which operation has yet to generate significant revenues to the Company.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
require cash to fund our operations and we have experienced significant losses and negative cash flows in the recent past. Further,
our independent auditors modified their report for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 to express substantial doubt as
to our ability to continue as a going concern. Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through the public
and private sales of our securities, revenues received from customers and otherwise. We had a decrease in issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock from 115,895,731 shares at December 31, 2015, to 5,181,948 at September 30, 2016, due to the Reverse
Stock Split, as further described in the  Overview  section of Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

As of September 30, 2016, our total current
assets were $4,724 and our total current liabilities were $17,347. On September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $52,417.
We currently finance our operations through revenues from our binary options business, and with funds provided by borrowings and
issuance of stock and warrant activities described below. We plan to continue raising funds in such ways in order to continue
our operations and to leverage our binary options business. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in raising
such funds.  

On
March 31, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Compagnie Financiere St. Exupery Sicav-Sif providing for
the issuance and sale by us to the purchaser, in a private placement, of an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock
at a price of $6.00 per share, corresponding to an aggregate purchase price of $6,000,000, and a warrant to purchase up to an
additional 888,889 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $6.75 per share, which is exercisable 6 months after the
closing.  

On
January 29, 2016, the Company entered into a convertible loan agreement pursuant to which the lender loaned the Company the principal
amount of  1,000,000. The loan matures in January 2017, and bears an annual interest rate of 12%, to be paid together with
the outstanding principal in one lump sum. The loan is convertible into 249,967 shares of common stock of the Company upon either:
(i) the Company s election to convert all or part of the principal amount of the Loan outstanding at such time, including
any accrued and unpaid interest into the converted common stock (or a pro rata portion thereof in case of partial conversion)
or (ii) the occurrence of an event of default under the convertible loan agreement.  

On
February 16, 2016, one of the lenders under a prior convertible loan agreement dated October 29, 2013, by and among the Company
and certain Company shareholders, elected to convert  200,000 into 48,129 shares of common stock of the Company.  

The Company entered into a convertible loan
agreement with Finandrea S.P.A., as lender, dated as of October 10, 2016, pursuant to which the lender loaned the Company the
principal amount of $1.1 million. The loan matures in October 2017, and bears an annual interest rate of 8%, to be paid together
with the outstanding principal in one lump sum. The loan is convertible into 160,025 shares of common stock of the Company. In
addition the Company issued to one of its investors 16,667 warrants at an exercise price of $6.00 per share, to expire 5 years
from the date of issuance. 

On
October 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement dated as of October 19, 2016 (the  Subscription Agreement )
with WinnerOption Ltd., a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Israel ( WinnerOption ), providing
for the issuance and sale by WinnerOption to the Company, in a private placement, of an aggregate of 4,996 Ordinary Shares of
WinnerOption stock, or approximately 19.99% of WinnerOption s outstanding Ordinary Shares (collectively, the  Shares )
valued at approximately $1,000,000, in exchange for the Company s contribution of: (i) certain of its intellectual property
relating to social gaming technology, and (ii) payment of $276,000 in cash to WinnerOption at such times after the date of the
Subscription Agreement as determined by the Company in consultation with WinnerOption. As a result of its acquisition of the Shares,
the Company is subject to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement of WinnerOption (the  Shareholders Agreement ),
which includes customary terms and provisions governing the Company s ownership of the Shares, including restrictions on
transferability of the Shares. The Shareholders Agreement also entitles the Company to designate one out of the four directors
to serve on WinnerOption s board of directors.  

Shimon
Citron, the Company s CEO, is the current controlling shareholder and a director of WinnerOption. The terms of the transaction
between the Company and WinnerOption were approved by a Special Committee of the Company s Board of Directors of which Mr.
Citron was not a member.  

Net cash used in operating activities was
$4,971,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $1,123,000
in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which resulted primarily from operating expenses of our binary options business, including
marketing expenses, employee wages, and depreciation expenses due to investment in our platform.  

Net cash used in investing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,534,000, as compared to net cash used in investing activities during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 of $1,149,000, mainly due to the purchase of $1,849,000 in fixed assets, investment in our platform,
and the increase in segregated client cash accounts of approximately $1,849,000.  

Net cash provided by financing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $8,505,000 as compared to $2,272,000 provided by financing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the resulting difference primarily from the issuance of shares and warrants in the amount
of approximately $5,850,000 in connection with the March 2016 securities purchase agreement, an increase of $1,998,000 due to
a line of credit granted by a bank, and an increase of $1,436,000 in proceeds received from convertible loans, offset by repayment
of approximately $1,330,000 of convertible and short term loans and a decrease of approximately $1,631,000 in prepayment on account
of shares.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to
have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Outlook   

We
believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our binary options business. Although our current anticipated
levels of revenues and cash flow are subject to many uncertainties and cannot be assured, we believe that we have sufficient cash
to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), the Company carried
out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined
under Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2016. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2016 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

On
June 17, 2015, Feyenoord Rotterdam N.V. ( Feyenoord ) instituted an arbitration proceeding against the Company before
the Netherlands Arbitration Institute in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The proceeding related to a strategic partnership agreement
between the parties which was terminated by the Company on September 28, 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company had to pay
Feyenoord, a professional football club, a total of  1.025 million over a three-year period. Feyenoord alleged that the Company s
termination of the agreement constituted an anticipatory breach under article 6:80, paragraph 1(b) of the Dutch Civil Code and
sought all remuneration due under the agreement. The arbitration proceeding has been completed and on April 6, 2016 the arbitral
tribunal issued the award which stated that the agreement between the Company and Feyenoord was terminated and dissolved as of
January 27, 2015, and both parties share responsibility for this termination. In view of this conclusion, the arbitral tribunal
ordered the Company to pay Feyenoord half of the contract in an amount of  513 thousand, plus half the arbitration costs
in the sum of  32 thousand. According to the arbitration decision, a provision was included in the Company's condensed consolidated
financial statements. The Company appealed to revert this decision on July 6, 2016.  

Item
5. Other Information.   

The Company entered into a convertible loan
agreement with Finandrea S.P.A., as lender, dated as of October 10, 2016, pursuant to which the lender loaned the Company the
principal amount of $1.1 million. The loan matures in October 2017, and bears an annual interest rate of 8%, to be paid together
with the outstanding principal in one lump sum. The loan is convertible into 160,025 shares of common stock of the Company. In
addition the Company issued to one of its investors 16,667 warrants at an exercise price of $6.00 per share, to expire 5 years
from the date of issuance. 

On January 11, 2016, the Company received a written  Wells Notice  from SEC staff (the  Staff )
indicating its preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an action against the Company for violations of certain
federal securities laws primarily related to its binary options platform. A Wells Notice is neither a formal allegation of wrongdoing
nor a finding that any violations of law have occurred. Rather, it provides the Company with an opportunity to respond to issues
raised by the Staff and offer its perspective prior to any Commission decision to institute proceedings. On February 3, 2016,
the Company submitted a written submission to the Staff setting forth reasons why the proposed enforcement should not be filed.
Subsequently, the Company determined to make an offer of settlement, without an admission or denial of liability, and that offer
was accepted by the SEC on November 10, 2016. On that same date, and in connection with the settlement, an Administrative Court
of the SEC issued an order (the  Order ) that the binary options sold by the Company to U.S. customers between 2011
and 2014, and that the Company s failure to register its binary options or register as a broker-dealer, were violations
of U.S. securities laws. The Order also provided that certain disclosures to the Company s customers regarding the binary
option platform were inadequate. The Order did not contain any findings of fraud. The Wells Notice, settlement offer and Order
do not relate to the current business operations of the Company. EZTD had closed its platform to new U.S. customers in January
of 2014, and by the end of the third quarter of 2014, the Company had prohibited existing U.S. customers from making additional
deposits to their accounts. Accordingly, the SEC proceedings concerned only historical business operations. The Order censures
the Company, and requires that it cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section
10(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Order further
requires that the Company pay disgorgement fees of $1,515,858 reflecting revenues earned during the period in which the Company
operated its binary option platform in the United States, together with prejudgment interest of $57,691 and a civil monetary penalty
in the amount of $200,000 to the SEC, in twelve monthly installments, within one year from the Order Date. The Company will make
its first payment of $147,796 by November 20, 2016, and starting the second month after the Order Date, the Company will pay the
remaining eleven monthly installments of $147,796 on the last date of each month. A proper provision was previously included in
the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

of the Company, legally enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms.

5.   
        Representations and Warranties of the Lender      

5.1.         The
Lender is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and has the full power and
authority to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder.  

5.2.         The
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder and the performance of this Agreement by the Lender do not violate the
provisions of its corporate documents, or any applicable law, and will not result in any breach of, or constitute a default under,
any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or under which it is bound.  

5.3.         The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Lender have been duly authorized by all necessary actions, and this
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Lender. This Agreement is valid and binding upon such Lender and enforceable
in accordance with its terms.  

5.4.         The
Lender understands that the Conversion Shares are  restricted securities  and have not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the   Securities Act  ) or any applicable state securities law and is acquiring the Securities
as principal for its own account and not with a view to or for distributing or reselling such Conversion Shares or any part thereof
in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law, has no present intention of distributing any of such
Conversion Shares in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law and has no direct or indirect arrangement
or understandings with any other persons to distribute or regarding the distribution of such Conversion Shares in violation of
the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law.  

5.5.         At
the time such Lender was offered the Conversion Shares, it was a  non-US person  as defined in Regulation S (  Regulation
S  ) as promulgated under the Securities Act.  

5.6.         Such
Lender, either alone or together with its representatives, has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in business and financial
matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Conversion Shares, and has
so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment. Such Lender is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Conversion
Shares and, at the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment. Such Lender acknowledges that as of the
date hereof, the Company has very limited financial resources, and thus an investment in the Conversion Shares is subject to significant
risk.  

5.7.         Such
Lender acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to review this Agreement and has been afforded (i) the opportunity to ask
such questions as it has deemed necessary of, and to receive answers from, representatives of the Company concerning the terms
and conditions of the transaction contemplated hereunder; (ii) access to information about the Company and its financial condition,
results of operations, business, properties, management and prospects sufficient to enable it to evaluate its investment; and
(iii) the opportunity to obtain such additional information that the Company possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort
or expense that is necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to the investment.  Such Lender acknowledges
and agrees that neither the Company nor any affiliate of the Company has provided such Lender with any information or advice with
respect to the Conversion Shares nor is such information or advice necessary or desired.   

5.8.         The
Lender further makes the representations and warranties to the Company set forth on  Exhibit A  pursuant to Regulation S
promulgated under the Securities Act.  

5.9.         Each
certificate representing the Conversion Shares shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend substantially in the following
form (in addition to any legend required by applicable state securities or  blue sky  laws):  

THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE   SECURITIES
ACT  ), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND NEITHER SUCH SECURITIES NOR ANY INTEREST THEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED,
ASSIGNED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT (1) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION S PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT, AND BASED ON AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, WHICH COUNSEL AND OPINION ARE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, THAT THE PROVISIONS
OF REGULATION S HAVE BEEN SATISFIED, (2) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE
STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR (3) PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE
STATE SECURITIES LAWS, IN WHICH CASE THE HOLDER MUST, PRIOR TO SUCH TRANSFER, FURNISH TO THE COMPANY AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, WHICH
COUNSEL AND OPINION ARE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, THAT SUCH SECURITIES MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED, ASSIGNED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE MANNER CONTEMPLATED PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE
MAY NOT BE CONDUCTED UNLESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT.    

Each
of the events or circumstances set out in the following paragraphs under this Section 6 is an Event of Default (whether or not
caused by any reason outside the control of the Borrower or of any other person):  

6.1.            Non-Payment.  The Company fails to pay on a Repayment Date any amount due and payable pursuant to this Agreement, unless payment is made as soon as practicable and in any event within fourteen (14) Business Days of the applicable due date.  

6.2.          Invalidity.
 This Agreement shall cease to be in full force and effect in any respect or shall not, or shall cease to, constitute the legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company, as applicable, or might become unlawful or the exercise or enforcement
of any rights and remedies of the Lender under this Agreement becomes subject to material legal impediments. Any default under
this Section 6.2 may be cured within seven (7) Business Days (without prejudice to any other Event of Default pursuant hereto).  

6.3.          Insolvency .
The Borrower shall become insolvent, however evidenced, or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or file with a court
of competent jurisdiction an application for appointment of a receiver, or similar official with respect to it or any substantial
part of its assets, or there shall be filed against the Borrower by any third party any such application or petition, which application
or petition is not dismissed or withdrawn within thirty (30) Business Days from the date of filing thereof.  

6.4.          Merger
without assumption.  The Borrower consolidates or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to,
or reorganizes, reincorporates or reconstitutes into or as, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation,
merger, transfer, reorganization, reincorporation or reconstitution the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume
all the obligations and undertakings of such party under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligations
and undertakings relating to Repayment Conversion under Section 3.1 above).  

Upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default and at any time, the Lender may, by written notice to the Borrower, declare that an Event
of Default has occurred and/or that all or part of the outstanding Loan Amount is immediately due and payable, whereupon it shall
become immediately due and payable, together with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement
(including Interest, fees and Repayment Amount, to the extent applicable). For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section shall
operate or be construed so as to prejudice or derogate from any other rights, remedies and relief available to the Lender under
this Agreement or by law.

7.1.          Confidentiality.

                                         contemplated by this Agreement with all other public information regarding the Company
                                         that such person or entity has requested and all such public information is sufficient

                                         person or entity understands and acknowledges that the Securities have not been recommended
                                         by any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority, that the foregoing
                                         authorities have not confirmed the accuracy or determined the adequacy of any information
                                         concerning the Company that has been supplied to such person or entity and that any representation
                                         to the contrary is a criminal offense.

   Pursuant
to Rule 13a-14(a)    

I,
Itai Loewenstein, certify that:  

1.
      I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of EZTD Inc.;  

2.
      Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  

3.
      Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this
report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant
as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;  

4.
      The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:  

(a)
      Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures
to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
prepared;  

(b)
      [paragraph omitted in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 13a-14(a)];  

(c)
      Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented
in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period
covered by this report based on such evaluation; and  

(d)
      Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case
of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal
control over financial reporting; and  

5.     
The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors
(or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

(a)
      All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information; and  

(b)
      Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
