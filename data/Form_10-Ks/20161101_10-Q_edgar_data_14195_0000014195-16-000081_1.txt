NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  1. Description of Business and General Information 
    
  Briggs   Stratton (the  Company ) is a U.S. based producer of gasoline engines and outdoor power equipment. The Company s Engines segment sells engines worldwide, primarily to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") of lawn and garden equipment and other gasoline engine powered equipment. The Company also sells related service parts and accessories for its engines. The Company s Products segment designs, manufacturers and markets a wide range of outdoor power equipment, job site products, and related accessories. 
    
  The majority of lawn and garden equipment is sold during the spring and summer months when most lawn care and gardening activities are performed. Engine sales in the Company s third fiscal quarter have historically been the highest, while sales in the first fiscal quarter have historically been the lowest. Sales of pressure washers and lawn and garden powered equipment are typically higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters than at other times of the year. Sales of portable generators and snowthrowers are typically higher during the first and second fiscal quarters. 
            Inventory levels generally increase during the first and second fiscal quarters in anticipation of customer demand. Inventory levels begin to decrease as sales increase in the third fiscal quarter. This seasonal pattern results in high inventories and low cash flow for the Company in the first, second and the beginning of the third fiscal quarters. The pattern generally results in higher cash flow in the latter portion of the third fiscal quarter and in the fourth fiscal quarter as inventories are liquidated and receivables are collected. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and therefore do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair statement of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but also does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, in the opinion of the Company, adequate disclosures have been presented to prevent the information from being misleading, and all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations and financial position have been included. All of these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, except as otherwise noted. 
    
  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto that were included in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
  2. New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The ASU was issued as part of the FASB Simplification Initiative and involves several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this new accounting pronouncement on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required, as well as a modified retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this new accounting pronouncement on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU No. 2016-01 enhances the existing financial instruments reporting model by modifying fair value measurement tools, simplifying impairment assessments for  
  
    8 

     Table of Contents  

certain equity instruments, and modifying overall presentation and disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this new accounting pronouncement on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740). Current guidance requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position; however, the new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of adoption to have a significant impact on the Company s financial position and will have no impact on the results of operations and cash flows. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, under either full or modified retrospective adoption. Early application is only permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this new accounting pronouncement on its results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
   
  3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  The following tables set forth the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (in thousands):   

  (1) Amounts reclassified to net income (loss) are included in net sales or cost of goods sold. See Note 8 for information related to derivative financial instruments.  
  (2) Amounts reclassified to net income (loss) are included in the computation of net periodic expense, which is presented in cost of goods sold or engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 6 for information related to pension and postretirement benefit plans.

  4. Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
       
  The Company computes earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method, an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings (loss) per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Company s unvested grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and deferred stock awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends (whether paid or unpaid), which are required to be treated as participating securities and included in the computation of basic earnings (loss) per share. 
    
  Information on earnings (loss) per share is as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 

10 

     Table of Contents  
  BRIGGS   STRATTON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The dilutive effect of the potential exercise of outstanding stock-based awards to acquire common shares is calculated using the treasury stock method. The following options to purchase shares of common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share as the exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares: 

As a result of the Company incurring a net loss for the three months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, potential incremental common shares of   695,455   and   882,464   respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
    
  On April 21, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized up to   $50 million   in funds for use in the common share repurchase program with an expiration date of June 29, 2018. As of October 2, 2016, the total remaining authorization was approximately   $41.5 million  . The common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants. During the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , the Company repurchased   443,384   shares on the open market at an average price of   $19.52   per share, as compared to   589,882   shares purchased on the open market at an average price of   $18.95   per share during the   three   months ended   September 27, 2015  .  
   
  5. Investments 
    
  Investments represent the Company s investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies.  
  The Company concluded that its equity method investments are integral to its business. The equity method investments provide manufacturing and distribution functions, which are important parts of its operations. Since the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company has prospectively classified its equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates as a separate line item within Income (Loss) from Operations. For periods prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates is classified in Other Income, Net.  
  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company sold its investment in marketable securities related to its ownership of common stock of a publicly-traded company and recognized a gain in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company received proceeds of   $3.3 million   related to the sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  
   
  6. Pension and Postretirement Benefits 
    
  The Company has noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement plans covering certain employees. The following tables summarize the plans  income and expense for the periods indicated (in thousands):

     Table of Contents  
  BRIGGS   STRATTON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The Company expects to make benefit payments of   $3.0 million   attributable to its non-qualified pension plans during fiscal 2017. During the first   three   months of fiscal 2017, the Company made payments of approximately   $0.6 million   for its non-qualified pension plans. The Company anticipates making benefit payments of approximately   $9.0 million   for its other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal 2017. During the first   three   months of fiscal 2017, the Company made payments of   $3.4 million   for its other postretirement benefit plans. 
    
  During the first   three   months of fiscal 2017, the Company made   no   cash contributions to the qualified pension plan. Based upon current regulations and actuarial studies, the Company is not required to make contributions to the qualified pension plan in fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2018. The Company may be required to make further contributions in future years or the future expected funding requirements may change depending on a variety of factors including the actual return on plan assets, the funded status of the plan in future periods, and changes in actuarial assumptions or regulations.  
   
  7. Stock Incentives 
    
  Stock based compensation expense is calculated by estimating the fair value of incentive stock awards granted and amortizing the estimated value over the awards' vesting period. Stock based compensation expense was   $1.2 million   for the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  . For the   three   months ended   September 27, 2015  , stock based compensation expense was   $1.6 million  .  
   
  8. Derivative Instruments   Hedging Activities 
    
  The Company enters into derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage certain interest rate, foreign currency and commodity exposures. Company policy allows derivatives to be used only for identifiable exposures and, therefore, the Company does not enter into hedges for trading purposes where the sole objective is to generate profits. 
    
  The Company formally designates the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure and documents both the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge. The Company formally assesses, both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in the forecasted cash flows of the related underlying exposure. Because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the forecasted cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. Derivative financial instruments are recorded within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. The effective portion of gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (AOCI) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.  
    
  The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, the cash flow hedge is dedesignated because a forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring, or management determines to remove the designation of the cash flow hedge.  
    
  In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company continues to carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet and recognizes any subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings. When it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and recognizes immediately in earnings gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income related to the hedging relationship. 
       
  The Company enters into interest rate swaps to manage a portion of its interest rate risk from financing certain dealer and distributor inventories through a third party financing source. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and are used to effectively fix the interest payments to a third party financing source, exclusive of lender spreads, ranging from   0.98%   to   1.60%   for a notional principal amount of   $157.5 million   with expiration dates ranging from   July 2017   through   July 2021  .

     Table of Contents  
  BRIGGS   STRATTON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

The Company enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the risk from forecasted third party and intercompany sales or payments denominated in foreign currencies. These obligations generally require the Company to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. Dollars, Australian Dollars, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollars, Chinese Renminbi, Euros, Japanese Yen, or Mexican Pesos. These contracts generally do not have a maturity of more than twenty-four months. 
       
  The Company uses raw materials that are subject to price volatility. The Company hedges a portion of its exposure to the variability of cash flows associated with commodities used in the manufacturing process by entering into forward purchase contracts or commodity swaps. Derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges are used by the Company to reduce exposure to variability in cash flows associated with future purchases of natural gas. These contracts generally do not have a maturity of more than thirty-six months. 
       
  The Company has considered the counterparty credit risk related to all of its interest rate, foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts and deems any risk of counterparty default to be minimal. 
       
  As of   October 2, 2016   and   July 3, 2016  , the Company had the following outstanding derivative contracts (in thousands):

9. Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 
    
  Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
    
  Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-driven valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
    
  Level 3: Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable. 
  The following table presents information about the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   October 2, 2016   and   July 3, 2016   (in thousands): 

The fair value for Level 2 measurements are based upon the respective quoted market prices for comparable instruments in active markets, which include current market pricing for forward purchases of commodities, foreign currency forwards, and current interest rates. 
    
  The Company has currently chosen not to elect the fair value option for any items that are not already required to be measured at fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
    
  The estimated fair value of the Company's Senior Notes (as defined in Note 14) at   October 2, 2016   and   July 3, 2016   was   $245.7 million   and   $240.2 million  , respectively, compared to the carrying value of   $223.1 million  . The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments and is, therefore, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying value of the Revolver (as defined in Note 14) approximates fair value since the underlying rate of interest is variable based upon LIBOR rates.   
    
  The Company believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, and accounts payable are reasonable estimates of their fair values at   October 2, 2016   and   July 3, 2016   due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

10. Warranty 
    
  The Company recognizes the cost associated with its standard warranty on Engines and Products at the time of sale. The general warranty period begins at the time of sale and typically covers two years, but may vary due to product type and geographic location. The amount recognized is based on historical failure rates and current claim cost experience. The following is a reconciliation of the changes in accrued warranty costs for the reporting period (in thousands): 

11. Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate for the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017 was   30.5%  , compared to   31.2%   for the same respective period last year. The effective tax rates for the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2016 were primarily impacted by losses incurred at certain foreign subsidiaries for which the Company does not receive tax benefits and foreign earnings in jurisdictions with tax rates that vary from the U.S. statutory rate. 
    
  For the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , the Company's unrecognized tax benefits increased by   $0.2 million  , all of which impacted the current effective tax rate.  
    
  Income tax returns are filed in the U.S., state, and foreign jurisdictions and related audits occur on a regular basis.  In the U.S., the Company is currently under audit for the fiscal years 2010 and 2013, and is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations before fiscal 2010. The Company is also currently under audit by various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to tax examinations before fiscal 2006 in its major foreign jurisdictions. 
   
  12. Commitments and Contingencies 
  The Company is subject to various unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business. These actions typically relate to product liability (including asbestos-related liability), patent and trademark matters, and disputes with customers, suppliers, distributors and dealers, competitors and employees. 
    
  On May 14, 2010, the Company notified retirees and certain retirement eligible employees of various amendments to the Company-sponsored retiree medical plans intended to better align the plans offered to both hourly and salaried retirees. On August 16, 2010, a putative class of retirees who retired prior to August 1, 2006 and the United Steel Workers filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin (Merrill, Weber, Carpenter, et al.; United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO/CLC v. Briggs   Stratton Corporation; Group Insurance Plan of Briggs   Stratton Corporation; and Does 1 through 20, Docket No. 10-C-0700), contesting the Company's right to make these changes. The complaint sought an injunction preventing the alleged unilateral termination or reduction in insurance coverage to the class of retirees, a permanent injunction preventing defendants from ever making changes to the retirees' insurance coverage, restitution with interest (if applicable) and attorneys' fees and costs. A class was certified and discovery was concluded. Both parties moved for summary judgment, which was fully briefed on December 23, 2014. The court denied both sides  motions on September 3, 2015, concluding that factual issues were present which precluded summary judgment and should be determined by the jury at trial.  The Company filed a motion requesting permission to appeal the court s decision on an interlocutory basis. The plaintiffs also moved the court to clarify its decision. Upon the request of all parties, the court stayed any further decisions in the matter pending mediation in mid-December 2015. The mediation led to an agreement in principle to settle this case for an aggregate payment of   $3.95 million   covering both claimed benefits and plaintiffs  attorneys fees, which  
  
    16 

     Table of Contents  
  BRIGGS   STRATTON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

resulted in a contribution of   $1.975 million   from the Company and   $1.975 million   from a third party insurance provider. The Company recorded a total charge of   $1.975 million   as Engineering, Selling, General and Administrative Expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 related to this matter. The parties filed a signed Stipulation of Settlement with the court on April 12, 2016 and the court held a hearing on the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the terms and conditions of the settlement and on the fee petition of the plaintiffs' counsel on August 11, 2016. The court approved the settlement following that hearing. 
  On May 12, 2010, Exmark Manufacturing Company, Inc. filed suit against Briggs   Stratton Power Products Group, LLC ( BSPPG ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (Case No. 8:10CV187, U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska), alleging that certain Ferris  and Snapper Pro  mower decks infringed an Exmark mower deck patent. Exmark sought damages relating to sales since May 2004, attorneys  fees, and enhanced damages. As a result of a reexamination proceeding in 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) initially rejected the asserted Exmark claims as invalid.  However, in 2014, that decision was reversed by the USPTO on appeal by Exmark. Following discovery, each of BSPPG and Exmark filed several motions for summary judgment in the Nebraska district court, which were decided on July 28, 2015. The court concluded that older mower deck designs infringed Exmark s patent, leaving for trial the issues of whether current designs infringed, the amount of damages, and whether any infringement was willful. 
  The trial began on September 8, 2015, and on September 18, 2015, the jury returned its verdict, finding that BSPPG s current mower deck designs do not infringe the Exmark patent. As to the older designs, the jury awarded Exmark   $24.3 million   in damages and found that the infringement was willful, allowing the judge to enhance the jury s damages award post-trial by up to three times. Also on September 18, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued its decision in an unrelated case,    SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag SCA Personal Care, Inc. v. First Quality Baby Products, LLC, et al.    (Case No. 2013-1564) ( SCA ), confirming the availability of laches as a defense to patent infringement claims. Laches is an equitable doctrine that may bar a patent owner from obtaining damages prior to commencing suit, in circumstances in which the owner knows or should have known its patent was being infringed for more than six years. Although the court in the Exmark case ruled before trial that BSPPG could not rely on the defense of laches, as a result of the subsequent SCA decision, the court held a bench trial on that defense on October 21 and 22, 2015. On May 2, 2016, the United States Supreme Court agreed to review the SCA decision. 
  The parties submitted post-trial motions and briefing related to: damages; willfulness; laches; attorney fees; enhanced damages; and prejudgment/post-judgment interest and costs.  All post-trial motions and briefing were completed on December 18, 2015. On May 11, 2016, the court ruled on those post-trial motions and entered judgment against BSPPG and in favor of Exmark in the amount of   $24.3 million   in compensatory damages, an additional   $24.3 million   in enhanced damages, and   $1.5 million   in pre-judgment interest along with post-judgment interest and costs to be determined. BSPPG and the Company strongly disagree with the jury verdict, certain rulings made before and during trial, and the May 11, 2016 post-trial rulings. BSPPG has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on several bases, including the issues of obviousness and invalidity of Exmark s patent, the damages calculation, willfulness and laches. 
    
  In assessing whether the Company should accrue a liability in its financial statements as a result of the May 11, 2016 post-trial rulings, the Company considered various factors, including the legal and factual circumstances of the case, the trial record, the post-trial orders, the current status of the proceedings, applicable law, the views of legal counsel, and the likelihood of successful appeals. As a result of this review, the Company has concluded that a loss from this case is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time and, therefore, a liability has not been recorded with respect to this case as of October 2, 2016. 
    
  Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these and other unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the Company believes the unresolved legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

13. Segment Information 
    
  The Company aggregates operating segments that have similar economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers and distribution methods into reportable segments. The Company concluded that it operates two reportable segments: Engines and Products.  
    
  The Company uses  segment income (loss)  as the primary measure to evaluate operating performance and allocate capital resources for the Engines and Products Segments. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, segment income (loss) is defined as income (loss) from operations plus equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2016, segment income (loss) is equal to operating income (loss).  
    
  Summarized segment data is as follows (in thousands):

14. Debt 
    
   The following is a summary of the Company s indebtedness (in thousands): 

On December 20, 2010, the Company issued   $225 million   of   6.875%   Senior Notes ("Senior Notes") due   December 15, 2020  . During fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased   $1.9 million   of the Senior Notes after receiving unsolicited offers from bondholders. 
    
  On March 25, 2016, the Company entered into a   $500 million   amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement (the  Revolver ) that matures on   March 25, 2021  . The Revolver amended and restated the Company s $500 million multicurrency credit agreement dated as of   October 13, 2011   (as previously amended), which would have matured on   October 21, 2018  . The initial maximum availability under the Revolver is   $500 million  . Availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit. The Company may from time to time increase the maximum availability under the revolving credit facility by up to   $250 million   if certain conditions are satisfied. As of   October 2, 2016  ,   $50.2 million   was outstanding under the Revolver. There were no borrowings under the Revolver as of July 3, 2016. The Company classifies debt issuance costs related to the Revolver as an asset, regardless of whether it has any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit arrangements. 
    
  The Senior Notes and the Revolver contain restrictive covenants. These covenants include restrictions on the ability of the Company and/or certain subsidiaries to pay dividends, repurchase equity interests of the Company and certain subsidiaries, incur indebtedness, create liens, consolidate and merge and dispose of assets, and enter into transaction with the Company's affiliates. The Revolver contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and impose on the Company a maximum average leverage ratio. 

15. Separate Financial Information of Subsidiary Guarantor of Indebtedness 
    
  Under the terms of the Company s Senior Notes and the Revolver (collectively, the  Domestic Indebtedness ), Briggs   Stratton Power Products Group, LLC, a   100%   owned subsidiary of the Company, was the sole joint and several guarantor of the Domestic Indebtedness (the  Guarantor ) as of October 2, 2016 and July 3, 2016. The Guarantor provides a full and unconditional guarantee of the Domestic Indebtedness, except for certain customary limitations. These customary limitations, which are described in detail in the First Supplemental Indenture (Indenture) dated December 20, 2010, include (i)   the sale of the guarantor or substantially all of the guarantor s assets, (ii) the designation of the guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for covenant purposes, (iii) the guarantor ceasing to guarantee certain other indebtedness, if the guarantor is also not a significant subsidiary within the meaning of Article 1, Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X, and (iv) achieving the Indenture s requirements for legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or discharge.   Additionally, if at any time a domestic subsidiary of the Company  
  
    19 

     Table of Contents  
  BRIGGS   STRATTON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

constitutes a significant domestic subsidiary, then such domestic subsidiary will also become a guarantor of the Domestic Indebtedness. Currently, all of the Domestic Indebtedness is unsecured. If the Company were to fail to make a payment of interest or principal on its due date, the Guarantor is obligated to pay the outstanding Domestic Indebtedness. The Company had the following outstanding amounts related to the guaranteed debt (in thousands):

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following table is a reconciliation of financial results by segment, as reported, to adjusted financial results by segment, excluding restructuring charges, acquisition-related charges, and litigation charges, for the three months ended fiscal September 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per share data): 

(1) For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, includes pre-tax restructuring charges of $3,373 ($2,239 after tax), pre-tax acquisition-related charges of $276 ($179 after tax), and pre-tax litigation charges of $850 ($553 after tax). There were no such charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
  (2) Adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes this information is meaningful to investors as it isolates the impact that restructuring charges, acquisition-related charges, and litigation charges have on reported financial results and facilitates comparisons between peer companies. The Company may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as a guide in the forecasting, budgeting, and long-term planning process. While the Company believes that adjusted financial results are useful supplemental information, such adjusted financial results are not intended to replace its GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. 
  (3) The Company defines segment income (loss) as income from operations plus equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. For all periods presented, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is included in segment income (loss). Since the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company has classified its equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates within income from operations. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is classified in other income.

NET SALES 
    
  Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were $287 million, a decrease of $3 million, or 0.9%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  
    
  Engines Segment net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased $4 million or 2.9% from the prior year. Starting in fiscal 2017, the Company implemented new sales terms for engines shipped to overseas customers in which title and risk of loss pass to the customer when the engines are delivered to a carrier for shipment.  Sales terms used in previous fiscal years caused deferral of revenue recognition for certain in-transit shipments.  Net sales were higher by $18 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 for approximately 150,000 units shipped for which revenue would have been deferred, if sold under the former terms.  If comparable sales terms had been used, the volume of engines recognized in revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 would have decreased 13%, or approximately 130,000 engines. The decrease is due to lower sales of engines used on snowthrowers due to elevated channel inventories and continued anticipation that customers will produce later in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.  With regard to the new sales terms implemented this year, the Company expects that the impact of this change will be to shift sales from the second half of fiscal 2017 to the first half, with the majority of the first half impact to occur in the first quarter. Given the seasonal nature of our business, the full year impact of the terms change is expected to be insignificant on net sales and profitability. 
    
  Products Segment net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased $12 million, or 7.2%, from the prior year. Net sales decreased primarily due to lower shipments of snowthrowers, pressure washers, and service parts, partially offset by higher shipments of high-end residential and commercial lawn and garden equipment through the Company's North American dealer channel.    
    
  GROSS PROFIT 
    
  The consolidated gross profit percentage was   18.3%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017, an increase from   17.2%   in the same period last year. 
    
  The Engines Segment gross profit percentage was   20.1%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017, an increase of 430 basis points from the   15.8%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted gross profit percentage was 16.2% in the first quarter last year. Gross profit percentage increased due to favorable sales mix, slightly lower material costs, favorable foreign exchange and manufacturing efficiency improvements.  Production volume decreased by 7% as planned. 
    
  The Products Segment gross profit percentage was   15.2%   for the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017, down from   16.7%   in the   first   quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted gross profit percentage was 18.1% in the first quarter last year. Gross profit percentage decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange and reduced production of snowthrowers due to elevated channel inventories.  
    
  ENGINEERING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
    
  Engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were   $72.1 million   in the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017,   a decrease   of   $0.1 million   or   0.1%   from the   first   quarter of fiscal 2016.  
    
  The Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased $0.2 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted Engines Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses (which only included adjustments last year) increased $1.0 million largely due to higher costs associated with the ERP upgrade project and higher pension costs.  
    
  The Products Segment engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses were $27.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a decrease of $0.2 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses (which only included adjustments last year) in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 were $0.2 million lower than the same period last year. 
    
  INTEREST EXPENSE 
    
  Interest expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was consistent with the same period last year.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 
  The effective tax rate for the   first   quarter of fiscal 2017 was   30.5%  , compared to   31.2%   for the same respective period last year. The effective tax rates for the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2016 were primarily impacted by losses incurred at certain foreign subsidiaries for which the Company does not receive tax benefits and foreign earnings in jurisdictions with tax rates that vary from the U.S. statutory rate. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
       
  Cash flows   used   in operating activities for the first   three   months of fiscal 2017 were   $76.5 million   compared to   $82.7 million   in the first   three   months of fiscal 2016. The improvement in operating cash flows used was primarily related to a lower net loss. 
    
  Cash flows   used   in investing activities were   $12.4 million   and   $14.1 million   during the first   three   months of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. The $1.7 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to $3.3 million in proceeds received from the sale of an investment in marketable securities during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to no proceeds received in the same period last year and no acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $2.2 million of cash paid for acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by $3.3 million of higher capital expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year. 
    
  Cash flows provided by financing activities were   $41.8 million   during the first   three   months of fiscal 2017 as compared to $33.7 million during the first three months of fiscal 2016. The $8.1 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was attributable to $50.2 million of borrowings under the Revolver in the first three months of fiscal 2017 compared to $38.4 million of borrowings in fiscal 2016 as well as a $2.5 million decrease in treasury stock purchases in the first three months of fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, partially offset by $5.3 million of lower stock option proceeds in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year and $0.8 million of cash paid related to an acquisition contingent liability in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to no payments in the same period last year. 
    
  FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  On December 20, 2010, the Company issued   $225 million   of   6.875%   Senior Notes ("Senior Notes") due   December 15, 2020  . During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased   $1.9 million   of the Senior Notes after receiving unsolicited offers from bondholders. 
    
  On March 25, 2016, the Company entered into a   $500 million   amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement (the  Revolver ) that matures on   March 25, 2021  . The Revolver amended and restated the Company s $500 million multicurrency credit agreement dated as of   October 13, 2011   (as previously amended), which would have matured on   October 21, 2018  . The initial maximum availability under the revolving credit facility is  
  $500 million  . Availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit. The Company may from time to time increase the maximum availability under the revolving credit facility by up to   $250 million   if certain conditions are satisfied. As of   October 2, 2016  ,   $50.2 million   was outstanding under the Revolver. There were no borrowings under the Revolver as of July 3, 2016.  
    
  In August 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.135 per share to $0.14 per share on the Company's common stock for the dividend payable on October 3, 2016. 
    
  On April 21, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized up to   $50 million   in funds for use in the common share repurchase program with an expiration date of June 29, 2018. The prior share repurchase program expired as of June 30, 2016. As of October 2, 2016, the total remaining authorization was approximately   $41.5 million  . The common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time, depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants. During the   three   months ended   October 2, 2016  , the Company repurchased   443,384   shares on the  
  
    28 

     Table of Contents  
  BRIGGS   STRATTON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

open market at an average price of   $19.52   per share, as compared to   589,882   shares purchased on the open market at an average price of   $18.95   per share during the   three   months ended   September 27, 2015  .  
    
  The Company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $70 million to $80 million in fiscal 2017. These anticipated expenditures reflect its plans to continue to invest in efficient equipment and innovative new products. 
    
  During the first   three   months of fiscal 2017, the Company made   no   cash contributions to the qualified pension plan. Based upon current regulations and actuarial studies, the Company is not required to make contributions to the qualified pension plan in fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2018. The Company may be required to make further contributions in future years or the future expected funding requirements may change depending on a variety of factors including the actual return on plan assets, the funded status of the plan in future periods, and changes in actuarial assumptions or regulations.  
    
  Management believes that available cash, cash generated from operations, existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be adequate to fund the Company s capital requirements and operational needs for the foreseeable future. 
    
  The Senior Notes and the Revolver contain restrictive covenants. These covenants include restrictions on the ability of the Company and/or certain subsidiaries to pay dividends, repurchase equity interests of the Company and certain subsidiaries, incur indebtedness, create liens, consolidate and merge and dispose of assets, and enter into transaction with the Company's affiliates. The Revolver contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and impose on the Company a maximum average leverage ratio. As of   October 2, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with these covenants, and expects to be in compliance with all covenants during the remainder of fiscal 2016.

  There have been no material changes since the August 30, 2016 filing of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, except that subsequent to the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, based upon current regulations and actuarial studies, the Company continues to expect it will be required to make no minimum contributions to the qualified pension plan in fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2018; however, the Company now expects that its required contributions to the qualified pension plan will be approximately $15 million in fiscal 2019 and $56 million during the period of fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2021.  
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  There have been no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies since the August 30, 2016 filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in its annual report, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. 
    
  The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company's financial statements include a goodwill assessment, estimates as to the realizability of accounts receivable and inventory assets, as well as estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to customer rebates, pension obligations, postretirement benefits, warranty, product liability, group health insurance, litigation and taxation. Various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates. The process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix, and, in some instances, actuarial techniques. The Company re-evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances change.
