LIGHTING SCIENCE GROUP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   
   NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)    

Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   
     
    Overview    
     
  Lighting Science Group Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware in 1988 and designs, develops and markets general illumination products that exclusively use light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) as their light source. The Company s product portfolio includes LED-based retrofit lamps (replacement bulbs) used in existing light fixtures and sockets as well as purpose built LED-based luminaires (light fixtures) for many common indoor and outdoor residential, commercial, industrial and public infrastructure lighting applications. The Company assembles and manufactures its products through its contract manufacturers in Asia.  
     
    Basis of Financial Statement Presentation    
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) in accordance with the disclosure requirements for the quarterly report on Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly state the results for the interim periods presented. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 is derived from the Company s audited financial statements. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of the Company that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016, as amended by the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on May 31, 2016.   
     
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
    Use of Estimates     
     
  The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, inventories, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an on  -going basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity, foreign currency and energy markets and declines in consumer spending have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.   
     
    Restricted Cash     
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as required by the Company s five-year term loan (as amended from time to time, the  Medley Term Loan ) with Medley Capital Corporation ( Medley ), the Company was required to maintain a minimum restricted cash balance of $3.0 million to collateralize the Medley Term Loan.   

6

Accounts Receivable     
     
  The Company records accounts receivable at the invoiced amount when its products are shipped to customers or upon the completion of specific milestone billing requirements. The Company s receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from customers. This allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company s best estimate of probable credit losses in the Company s existing accounts receivable. Estimates used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience, aging of receivables and known collectability issues. The Company writes off accounts receivable when it becomes apparent, based upon age or customer circumstances that such amounts will not be collected. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis. Recovery of bad debt amounts previously written off is recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense in the period the payment is collected. Generally, the Company does not require collateral for its accounts receivable and does not regularly charge interest on past due amounts. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts was $361,000 and $475,000, respectively.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $5.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively, of eligible accounts receivable were pledged as collateral for the three-year asset based revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the  FCC ABL ) entered into on April 25, 2014 with FCC, LLC d/b/a First Capital ( First Capital ). First Capital sold the FCC ABL to ACF FinCo I LP ( Ares ) in May 2015, and the FCC ABL, as amended from time to time, is hereinafter referred to as the  Ares ABL .  
     
    Revenue Recognition     
     
  The Company records revenue when its products are shipped and title passes to customers. When sales of products are subject to certain customer acceptance terms, revenue from such sales is recognized once these terms have been met. The Company also provides its customers with limited rights of return for non-conforming shipments or product warranty claims.   
     
    Product Warranties    
     
  The Company generally provides a five-year limited warranty covering defective materials and workmanship of its products and such warranty may require the Company to repair, replace or reimburse the purchaser for the purchase price of the product. The estimated costs related to warranties are accrued at the time products are sold based on various factors, including the Company s stated warranty policies and practices, the historical frequency of claims and the cost to repair or replace its products under warranty. The following table summarizes changes in the warranty liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

Fair Value Measurements    
     
  The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:   

Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.      

Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1, inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.      

Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.      
     
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments     
     
  Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, amounts due under lines of credit and other short term borrowings, accrued expenses and note payable are carried at amounts that approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and/or variable interest rates.   

7

The liabilities under derivative contracts, which represent warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ) were initially recorded at fair value and are adjusted for changes in fair value at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the warrant (the THD Warrant ) issued to The Home Depot, Inc. ( The Home Depot ) is determined using the Monte Carlo valuation method and will be adjusted at each reporting date until the underlying shares have been earned for each year  . Such adjustments will be recorded as a reduction in the related revenue (sales incentive) from The Home Depot  . Once a portion of the THD Warrant vests it is recorded at its fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period.   
     
    Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued ASU 2015-03 that intends to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The cost of issuing debt will no longer be recorded as a separate asset, except when incurred before receipt of the funding from the associated debt liability. The Company retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements or notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No 2015-17 to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-17 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements or notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and is intended to improve and converge the financial reporting requirements for revenue from contracts with customers with   International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosures about the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU 2014-09 allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption and is effective for   annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted but not before annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. The standard also provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new guidance is effective for the annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330).  This update requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of the update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact that the adoption of ASU 2015-11 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet. The new standard also aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in ASC 606, the FASB's new revenue recognition standard (e.g., those related to evaluating when profit can be recognized). Furthermore, ASU 2016-02 addresses other concerns related to the current leases model. For example, ASU 2016-02 eliminates the requirement in current GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. The standard also requires lessors to increase the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2016-02 for periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Reclassification     
     
  Certain prior period amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net loss or stockholders  deficit.  

Note 3. Liquidity and Capital Resources    
     
  As shown in the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced significant historical net losses as well as negative cash flows from operations since its inception, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $841.3 million and stockholders  deficit of $565.4 million as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million. The Company s cash expenditures primarily relate to procurement of inventory, payment of salaries, employee benefits and other operating costs.   
     
  The Company continues to face challenges in its efforts to achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operations. The Company s ability to continue to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business, including continued payment to its trade creditors, is dependent upon establishing profitable operations, supplemented by additional funds that the Company may raise through public or private financing or increased borrowing capacity.   
      
  The Company believes it will need to raise additional capital to fund its operations, including approximately $5.0 million of additional capital prior to December 31, 2016. In addition, because the Company s existing revolving line of credit facility expires on April 25, 2017, the Company is seeking to replace it in order to help fund its operations. Sources of additional capital and/or credit may not be available in an amount or on terms that are acceptable to the Company, if at all. The Company s complex capital structure, including its obligations to the holders of the outstanding shares of its Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined below) and its Series K Preferred Stock (the  Series K Preferred Stock ), may make it more difficult to raise additional capital from new or existing investors or lenders. If the Company is not able to raise such additional capital, the Company may need to restructure or refinance its existing obligations, which restructuring or refinancing would require the consent and cooperation of the Company s creditors and certain stockholders. In such event, the Company may not be able to complete a restructuring or refinancing on terms that are acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital when needed, the Company s business, compliance with its credit facilities and future prospects will be adversely affected.    
       
  The Company s primary sources of liquidity have historically been borrowings from Ares under the Ares ABL, from Medley under the Medley Term Loan and from other previous lenders, as well as sales of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock to, and short-term loans from, affiliates of Pegasus Capital Advisors, L.P. ( Pegasus Capital ), including Pegasus Partners IV, L.P. ( Pegasus Fund IV ), LSGC Holdings, LLC ( LSGC Holdings ), LSGC Holdings II, LLC ( Holdings II ), LSGC Holdings III LLC ( Holdings III ) and PCA LSG Holdings, LLC ( PCA Holdings  and collectively with Pegasus Capital, Pegasus Fund IV, LSGC Holdings, Holdings II, Holdings III and their affiliates,  Pegasus ). Pegasus is the Company s controlling stockholder. While Pegasus has led a majority of the Company s capital raises, certain offerings of Convertible Preferred Stock also involved and/or were led by parties other than Pegasus.  
     
  The Company obtained the five-year, $30.5 million Medley Term Loan from Medley on February 19, 2014. Pursuant to the Medley Term Loan, the Company is required to achieve a minimum quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio for the preceding 12-month period and to maintain certain minimum quarterly EBITDA levels. The Company also maintains   $3.0 million in restricted cash subject to a cash collateral dominion agreement pursuant to the Medley Term Loan.  
     
  The Company also obtained a revolving credit facility with a maximum line amount of $22.5 million from Ares which expires on April 25, 2017, pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (as amended from time to time, the  Ares ABL Agreement ). As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $9.2 million in borrowings outstanding under the Ares ABL Agreement and additional borrowing capacity of $861,000  . The maximum borrowing capacity under the Ares ABL Agreement is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The Ares    ABL Agreement also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum quarterly EBITDA levels for the preceding 12-month period.    
     
  Since January 1, 2015  , the Company issued an aggregate of 29,525 of its Series J Securities to Holdings III and issued 62 Series J Securities to certain existing preferred stockholders upon exercise of their preemptive rights under the certificates of designation governing the Convertible Preferred Stock. In each case, the Series J Securities were issued at a purchase price of $1,000 per Series J Security, and the Company received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $29.6 million in connection with these issuances. Each Series J Security consists of (i) one share of Series J Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series J Preferred Stock ) and (ii) a warrant to purchase 2,650 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $0.001 per share (the  Series J Warrants ).

In 2015  , the Company s largest customer, The Home Depot, performed a periodic product line review relating to its entire private label LED lighting product offering. Following the line review, the Company entered into a new supplier buying agreement with The Home Depot, which went into full effect in the second quarter of 2016. Pursuant to this new supplier buying agreement, The Home Depot has elected to purchase certain products previously supplied by the Company directly from overseas suppliers. Such products represented a significant percentage of the Company s sales to The Home Depot in 2015 and 2014. The Company was, however, selected to supply certain new products to The Home Depot and will continue to supply certain other products to The Home Depot under its prior agreement. In addition, the terms of the new supplier buying agreement with The Home Depot permit the Company to pursue opportunities to sell products to specified big box and other retailers, which was prohibited under its prior agreement. Notwithstanding the new supplier buying agreement, as was the case under the Company s prior agreement with The Home Depot, The Home Depot is not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from the Company. As a result of the line review, and based on the Company s results through the first nine months of 2016, the Company expects 2016 sales to The Home Depot to be significantly lower than in 2015.   
      
  In April 2016, Pegasus committed to provide financial support to the Company of up to $5.25 million, as needed, to fund its operations and debt service requirements through April 2017. The amount of this commitment has been reduced by the $5.0 million of Series J Securities purchased by Holdings III on July 19, 2016, with a remaining commitment amount of $250,000. The remaining amount of this commitment will be reduced by the amount of any capital provided by other parties (except for draws under the Ares ABL) that is not repayable by the Company on or before April 14, 2017. Management believes that, based upon current financial assumptions and projections, the Company will require approximately $5.0 million of additional capital from Pegasus or other financing sources to fund its operations through December 31, 2016.    
       
  RW LSG Holdings LLC ( Riverwood Holdings ) and Pegasus each have the right to cause the Company to redeem their shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series H Preferred Stock ) and Series I Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series I Preferred Stock  and, collectively with the Series H Preferred Stock and the Series J Preferred Stock, the  Convertible Preferred Stock ), respectively, at any time on or after March 27, 2017. If either Riverwood Holdings or Pegasus elects to cause the Company to redeem its shares of Series H Preferred Stock or Series I Preferred Stock, all other holders of the applicable series will similarly have the right to request the redemption of their shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, Portman Limited ( Portman ) and affiliates of Zouk Holdings Limited, acting together, have a contractual right to require the Company to redeem their respective shares of Series H Preferred Stock on or after March 27, 2017, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The Company is also required to redeem the outstanding shares of its Series J Preferred Stock (a) subject to certain limited exceptions, immediately prior to the redemption of the Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock or any other security that ranks junior to the Series J Preferred Stock and (b) on November 14, 2019, at the election of the holders of Series J Preferred Stock (a  Special Redemption ). Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock would also have the right to require the Company to redeem such shares upon the uncured material breach of the Company s obligations under its outstanding indebtedness or the uncured material breach of the terms of the certificates of designation governing the Convertible Preferred Stock.   Depending on whether the Appeal Bond (as defined below) has been drawn or fully released, the Series K Certificate of Designation requires us to redeem the outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or an earlier change of control or  junior security redemption,  which includes events triggering a redemption of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.   As of September 30, 2016, in the event the Company was required to redeem all of its outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Series K Preferred Stock (collectively, the  Preferred Stock ), the Company s maximum payment obligation would have been $540.2 million. The Company would be required to repay its outstanding obligations under the Medley Term Loan and the Ares ABL prior to the redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $39.5 million of aggregate borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities that it would be required to repay prior to any redemption of Preferred Stock  .  
     
  Any redemption of the Preferred Stock would be limited to funds legally available therefor under Delaware law. The certificates of designation governing the Preferred Stock provide that if there is not a sufficient amount of cash or surplus available to pay for a redemption of Preferred Stock, then the redemption must be paid out of the remaining assets of the Company. In addition, the certificates of designation governing the Preferred Stock provide that the Company is not permitted or required to redeem any shares of Preferred Stock for so long as such redemption would result in an event of default under the Company s credit facilities.   

10

As of September 30, 2016, based solely on a review of the Company s balance sheet, the Company did not have legally available funds under Delaware law to satisfy a redemption of its Preferred Stock. In addition, based solely on the Company s projected balance sheet as of March 27, 2017, the Company does not believe that it will have legally available funds on or before March 27, 2017 to satisfy any such redemption of the Preferred Stock.  
     
  The certificate of designation governing the Series H Preferred Stock also provides that upon the occurrence of a  control event,  the Company must take any and all actions required and permitted to fix the size of its board of directors to a size that would permit Riverwood Holdings (as the primary investor of the Series H Preferred Stock) to appoint a majority of the directors to the board until the Company satisfies or otherwise cures the obligations giving rise to the control event. A control event occurs if, among other things, Riverwood Holdings exercises its optional redemption right under the certificate of designation governing the Series H Preferred Stock and the Company is unable to redeem Riverwood Holdings  shares of Series H Preferred Stock. If Riverwood Holdings were to exercise its optional redemption right and a control event were to occur, Riverwood Holdings could take control of the board of directors.   
     
  The certificate of designation governing the Series J Preferred Stock provides that if the Company does not have sufficient capital available to redeem the Series J Preferred Stock in connection with a Special Redemption of the Series J Preferred Stock, the Company will be required to issue a non-interest bearing note or notes (payable 180 days after issuance) in the principal amount of the liquidation amount of any shares of Series J Preferred Stock not redeemed by the Company in connection with such Special Redemption, subject to certain limitations imposed by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders.  
     
  As discussed further in Note 14, one of the Company s stockholders, Geveran Investments Limited ( Geveran ), filed a lawsuit against the Company and certain other defendants seeking, among other things, rescissionary damages in connection with its $25.0 million investment in the Company. On August 28, 2014, the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida  , the court presiding over the lawsuit, issued an Order Granting Plaintiff s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment under its First Cause of Action for Violation of the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act. On November 30, 2015, the Court entered judgment against the defendants, including the Company, on a joint and several basis, in the amount of approximately $40.2 million (including pre-trial interest, attorney s fees, and statutory post-judgment interest). Accordingly, the Company and certain other related defendants  , with the assistance of Pegasus Fund IV, posted an appeal bond in the amount of $20.1 million (the  Appeal Bond ) in support of the Company s appeal of the partial summary judgment order. In consideration of Pegasus Fund IV s entry into the Appeal Bond and other related agreements (collectively, the  Appeal Bond Agreements ) and as security for the potential payments to be made to the issuer of the Appeal Bond for draws upon the Appeal Bond, the Company issued 20,106.03 units of its securities (the  Series K Securities ) to Pegasus Fund IV, with each Series K Security consisting of (a) one share of Series K Preferred Stock and (b) a warrant to purchase 735 shares of Common Stock. Although the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, it believes the court s partial summary judgment award in favor of Geveran was in error and that it has strong defenses against Geveran s claims. However, in the event that the Company is not successful on appeal, it could be liable for the full amount of the $40.2 million judgment, plus post judgment interest. Accordingly, the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit and disposition of the Appeal Bond could have a material adverse effect on the Company s liquidity and its ability to raise capital in the future.

    Medley     Term Loan    
     
  On February 19, 2014, the Company entered into the Medley Term Loan, which provided the Company with a $30.5 million term loan facility. The Medley Term Loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 12% per annum, and as of September 30, 2016, the interest rate on the Medley Term Loan was 12.84%.

As of September 30, 2016, the balance of the Medley Term Loan was $30.3 million. The Company recognized $195,000 of interest expense for the accretion of the discounts to the balance of the Medley Term Loan related to commitment fees and the Medley Warrants for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company recognized $584,000 of interest expense for the accretion of the discounts to the balance of the Medley Term Loan related to commitment fees and the Medley Warrants for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded expense of $0 and $37,000, respectively, related to restricted stock awards to the Company s SAB. No restricted stock expense associated with restricted stock awards to the Company s SAB was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  On August 10, 2016, 4,000 shares of Series I Redeemable Convertible preferred stock were converted into 4,210,528 shares of common stock by their holders.  
     
    Warrants for the Purchase of Common Stock    
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the following warrants for the purchase of Common Stock were outstanding:   

Note 10: Earnings (Loss) Per Share   
     
  The Company has two classes of Common Stock for financial reporting purposes only, with Common Stock attributable to controlling stockholders representing shares beneficially owned and controlled by Pegasus and the Common Stock attributable to noncontrolling stockholders representing the minority interest stockholders. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company computed net loss per share of noncontrolling stockholders and controlling stockholders of Common Stock using the two-class method. Net loss from operations is initially allocated based on the underlying common shares held by controlling and noncontrolling stockholders. The allocation of the net losses attributable to the Common Stock attributable to controlling stockholders is then reduced by the amount of the deemed dividends.   

15

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share of Common Stock:  

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. The Series J Warrants have an exercise price of $0.001 per share of Common Stock, and are included in the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as there are no conditions that must be satisfied before such warrant may be exercised into the shares of Common Stock underlying such warrants. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same manner as basic earnings per share except the number of shares is increased to assume exercise of potentially dilutive stock options, unvested restricted stock and contingently issuable shares using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred shares using the if-converted method, unless the effect of such increases would be anti-dilutive. The Company had 275.2 million and 213.3 million common stock equivalents for the three months ended September 30  , 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 272.9 million and 209.8 million common stock equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively  , which were not included in the diluted net loss per common share as the common stock equivalents were anti-dilutive, as a result of being in a net loss position.   

Note 11: Related Party Transactions    
     
  Pegasus Capital is an affiliate of Pegasus IV and LSGC Holdings, which are the Company s largest stockholders. Pegasus beneficially owned approximately 90.4% of the Common Stock as of September 30, 2016.   
     
  On February 23, 2016 and July 19, 2016, the Company issued 3,000 and 5,000 Series J Securities, respectively, to Holdings III pursuant to the Preferred Stock Subscription and Support Agreement dated September 11, 2015, among the Company, Pegasus Fund IV and Holdings III (as amended from time to time, the  Subscription and Support Agreement ) for aggregate gross proceeds of $8.0 million.  

16

Note 12. Restructuring Expense   

As of September 30, 2016, the accrued liability associated with the restructuring and other related charges consisted of the following:   

The remaining accrual of $265,693 as of September 30, 2016 is expected to be paid during the years ending December 31, 2016 through 2018.   

Note 13. Concentrations of Credit Risk    
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue from sales to one customer represented 86% and 89% of the Company s total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenue from sales to one customer represented 89% and 88% of the Company s total revenue, respectively.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had one customer whose accounts receivable balance represented 70% of accounts receivable, net of allowances.   

Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies         
     
  The Company is subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in its business and such contingencies are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 450, "Contingencies.  In determining loss contingencies, the Company considers the possibility of a loss as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of such loss or liability. An estimated loss is recorded when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In the ordinary course of business, the Company is routinely a defendant in or party to various pending and threatened legal claims and proceedings. The Company believes that any probable liability resulting from these various claims will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition; however, it is possible that extraordinary or unexpected legal fees could adversely impact the Company s financial results during a particular period. During its ordinary course of business, the Company enters into obligations to defend, indemnify and/or hold harmless various customers, officers, directors, employees, and other third parties. These contractual obligations could give rise to additional litigation costs and involvement in court proceedings.   
     
  On June 22, 2012, Geveran filed a lawsuit against the Company and several others in the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida. On October 30, 2012, the court entered an order transferring the lawsuit to the Ninth Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida. The action, styled Geveran Investments Limited v. Lighting Science Group Corp., et al., Case No. 12-17738 (07), names the Company as a defendant, as well as Pegasus Capital and nine other entities affiliated with Pegasus Capital; Richard Weinberg, our former Director and former interim Chief Executive Officer and a former partner of Pegasus Capital; Gregory Kaiser, a former Chief Financial Officer; J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC ( J.P. Morgan  and two employees of J.P. Morgan. Geveran seeks rescission of its $25.0 million investment in the Company, as well as recovery of interest, attorneys  fees and court costs, jointly and severally against the Company, Pegasus Capital, Mr. Weinberg, Mr. Kaiser, J.P. Morgan and the two J.P. Morgan employees, for alleged violations of Florida securities laws. Geveran alternatively seeks unspecified money damages, as well as recovery of court costs, for alleged common law negligent misrepresentation against these same defendants.   
     
  On August 28, 2014, the court issued an Order Granting Plaintiff s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment under its First Cause of Action for Violation of the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act.   On November 30, 2015, the Court entered judgment against the defendants, including the Company, on a joint and several basis, in the amount of approximately $40.2 million (including pre-trial interest, attorney s fees, and statutory post-judgment interest).  
     
  On December 4, 2015, the Company, along with certain other related defendants, filed a Notice of Appeal to the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal and posted a bond securing the judgment in the amount of approximately $20.1 million. Defendant J.P. Morgan also posted a separate bond in the amount of approximately $20.1 million, resulting in total bonding of approximately $40.2 million. On March 29, 2016, the trial court judge determined that the posted bonds were sufficient security to stay execution of the judgment pending the appeal.  

17

Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, we believe the court s summary judgment award in favor of Geveran was in error, that we will prevail on the appeal and the judgment will be overturned, and that the case will be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Were that to occur, we believe we have strong defenses against Geveran s claims. However, in the event that we are not successful on appeal, we could be liable for the full amount of the $40.2 million judgment, plus post judgment interest. Such an outcome would have a material adverse effect on our financial position.   
     
  The Company believes that, subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant policies (including retention and policy limits), directors  and officers  ( D O ) insurance coverage will be available to cover a substantial majority of its legal fees and costs in this matter. However, insurance coverage may not be available for, or such coverage may not be sufficient to fully pay, a judgment or settlement in favor of Geveran. On July 26, 2016, the Company,   along with certain other related defendants, filed a lawsuit in Delaware state court against its D O carriers, Liberty Insurance, Starr, and Continental Casualty, seeking a declaratory judgment and damages arising out of the defendant carriers  breach of their coverage obligations under various applicable D O policies.  
     
  Based upon the terms of an indemnification agreement, the Company has also paid, and may be required to pay in the future, reasonable legal expenses incurred by J.P. Morgan and its affiliates in this lawsuit in connection with the engagement of J.P. Morgan as placement agent for the private placement with Geveran. Such payments are not covered by the Company s insurance coverage. The engagement letter executed with J.P. Morgan provides that the Company will indemnify J.P. Morgan and its affiliates from liabilities relating to J.P. Morgan s activities as placement agent, unless such activities are finally judicially determined to have resulted from J.P. Morgan s bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.  
    
  The Company is also a defendant in an action brought by GE Lighting Solutions LLC ( GE Lighting ) in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in or about January 2013. GE Lighting asserts a claim of patent infringement against the Company under U.S Patent No. 6,787,999, entitled  LED-Based M  odular   Lamp   , and U.S  . Patent No. 6,799,864, entitled  High Power LED Power Pack for Spot Module   Illumination , and seeks monetary damages and an injunction. We have denied liability. On August 5, 2015, the court granted the Company s summary judgment motion invalidating the two GE Lighting patents at issue for indefiniteness, and dismissing GE Lighting s patent infringement claims against the Company and the other defendants. On September 2, 2015, GE Lighting filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On October 27, 2016, the Federal Circuit issued an opinion that affirmed the lower district court s ruling that   U.S. Patent No. 6,799,864 is invalid, and reversed the district   court s ruling that U.S. Patent No. 6,787,999 is invalid. With respect to the  999 patent, the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings.   We continue to believe that we have strong defenses against GE Lighting s claims with respect to U.S. Patent No. 6,787,999. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in defending against this action. The outcome, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Even if the outcome is favorable, this litigation could result in substantial additional costs to us, could be a distraction to management and could harm our financial position.   

In April 2015, the Company filed a lawsuit against several former employees and a company they formed seeking damages and injunctive relief arising out of the defendants  misappropriation of our trade secrets and other intellectual property.  Pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement entered into in December 2015, certain of the individual defendants agreed not to use or disclose our intellectual property and to reimburse us for $200,000 in costs, and the defendants  company agreed to pay us a commission equal to the greater of (i) $1.7 million and (ii) 5% of such company s gross sales of biological and agricultural products during the three-year period ending January 2019  . 

In addition, the Company may be a party to a variety of legal actions, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, including securities fraud, intellectual property related litigation, and a variety of legal actions relating to its business operations. In some cases, substantial punitive damages may be sought. The Company currently has insurance coverage for certain of these potential liabilities. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.   

Note 15. Subsequent Events    
     
  On October 13, 2016, a preferred stockholder converted 1,000 shares of Series I Preferred Stock into 1,052,632 shares of Common Stock.  
   
  On October 31, 2016, two preferred stockholders converted 2,095 shares of Series H Preferred Stock into 2,205,264 shares of Common Stock.

We believe that developing innovative and differentiated brands will deliver strong financial returns and a more loyal user base that is less price sensitive. We intend to continue to implement a nimble and agile  go-to-market  business model and manufacturing and product development system to streamline the processes used to introduce new products. We also intend to continue focusing on developing breakthrough innovation and on becoming a market maker in targeted value-added, high-margin segments within the lighting market. Finally, we plan to reduce our cost structure, preserve cash flow and strengthen liquidity to enhance our financial position.   
     
  Over the past few years, we have focused on expanding and optimizing our global supply chain to meet forecasted demand for our products while addressing the inefficiencies that have compressed our gross profit and overall financial performance in prior periods  , such as costs incurred to expedite the production or delivery of component parts. We have adapted our supply chain and logistics processes to improve our ability to provide more efficient service to our customers and focus our efforts on developing innovative products. We anticipate long-term gross profit improvement as we continue to execute on our cost-cutting initiatives. We completed one of our most critical initiatives in 2014 with the transition of the manufacturing of our high volume lamps from Mexico and Satellite Beach to our contract manufacturing partners in Asia, from which we source the majority of our components. In 2015, we opened a new distribution center in Seattle, Washington in order to reduce the transit time for products from Asia and to provide us with an additional port through which we can import goods. We believe that this additional distribution facility will help to better maintain the continuity of our supply chain and improve our supply-to-cash cycle time.      

19

In general, we believe these improvements will position us to capitalize on the innovative, science based and creative engineering talent at our Florida research and development facility, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Further, in addition to developing products targeted at mainstream retail and commercial lighting, we are seeking to expand our product offerings to compete across multiple industry verticals.     
     
    LED Lighting Industry Trends    
     
  There are a number of industry factors that affect our business and results of operations including, among others:   

Rate and extent of adoption of LED lighting products . Our potential for growth will be driven by the rate and extent of adoption of LED lighting within the general illumination market and our ability to affect this rate of adoption through the offering of competitive lighting solutions. Although LED lighting is relatively new, its adoption has grown in recent years. Innovations and advancements in LED lighting technology that improve product performance and reduce product cost continue to enhance the value proposition of LED lighting for general illumination and expand its potential commercial applications.      

External legislation and subsidy programs concerning energy efficiency . The United States and many countries in the European Union and elsewhere have already instituted, or have announced plans to institute, government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency in lighting. These actions include in certain cases banning the sale after specified dates of certain forms of incandescent lighting, which is advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as LEDs. In addition, the growing demand for electricity is increasingly driving utilities and governmental agencies to provide financial incentives such as rebates for energy efficient lighting technologies in an effort to mitigate the need for investments in new electrical generation capacity. While this trend is generally positive for us, from time to time there have been political efforts in the United States to change or limit the effectiveness of these regulations.     

Intellectual property . LED market participants rely on patented and non-patented proprietary information relating to product development, manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business. Protection and licensing of intellectual property is critical. Therefore, LED lighting industry participants often take steps such as additional patent applications, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements as well as other security measures. To enforce or protect intellectual property rights, market participants frequently threaten or commence litigation.      

Intense and constantly evolving competitive environment.  Competition in the LED lighting market is intense. Many companies have made significant investments in LED lighting development and production equipment. Traditional lighting companies and new entrants are investing in LED based lighting products as LED adoption has gained momentum and some of these companies have taken steps to limit access to their sales channels. Product pricing pressures are significant and market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share, enhance sales of their previously manufactured products and open new applications to LED based lighting solutions. To remain competitive, market participants must continuously increase product performance and reduce costs.     
     
    Recent Developments    
      
                  On July 19, 2016, we (i) filed a Certificate of Increase of Series J Convertible Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware increasing the number of authorized shares of our Series J Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series J Preferred Stock ) from 85,100 to 95,100 shares, and (ii) issued and sold 5,000   units of our securities ( Series J Securities ) to LSGC Holdings III LLC ( Holdings III ) for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 million, pursuant to the Preferred Stock Subscription and Support Agreement   dated September 11, 2015 among the Company, Pegasus Partners IV, LP ( Pegasus Fund IV ) and Holdings III, as amended. Each Series J Security was issued at a purchase price of $1,000 and consists of (a) one share of Series J Preferred Stock and (b) a warrant (a  Series J Warrant ) to purchase 2,650 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Common Stock ), at an exercise price of $0.001 per share of Common Stock.

Financial     Results    
     
  The following table sets forth our revenue, cost of goods sold  , gross profit and operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30  , 2016 and 2015:  

Our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our LED-based retrofit lamps and luminaires. Our revenue decreased by $5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in revenue was due to a $3.4 million decrease in sales to The Home Depot, Inc. ( The Home Depot ) and a $1.9 million decrease in sales to commercial customers. Our revenue decreased by $18.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in revenue was due to a $17.4 million decrease in sales to The Home Depot and a $1.3 million decrease in sales to commercial customers.   In 2015, our largest customer, The Home Depot, performed a periodic product line review relating to its entire private label LED lighting product offering. Following the line review, we entered into a new supplier buying agreement with The Home Depot, which went into full effect in the second quarter of 2016. Pursuant to this supplier buying agreement, The Home Depot has elected to purchase certain products previously supplied by us directly from overseas suppliers. Such products   represented   a significant percentage of our sales to The Home Depot in 2015, which is the primary reason for   the decline in sales to The Home Depot for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015. The $1.9 million and $1.3 million decrease in sales to commercial customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, was primarily due to the loss of two distribution customers, as well as sales of excess inventory at reduced prices.    
       
  We continue to pursue new relationships with retailers and original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) to help increase and diversify our sales. In addition, we have increased the roster of distributors and independent sales agents that sell our products and added experienced professionals to our direct sales force to increase the frequency and impact of our activities with key national accounts that are targets for potential adoption of our products  .   
     
  Our gross profit is principally driven by the mix and quantity of products we sell. Our financial results are dependent upon the operating costs associated with our supply chain, including materials, labor and freight, and the level of our selling, distribution and administrative, research and development and other operating expenses. We continuously seek to improve our existing products and to bring new products to market. As a result, many of our products have short life-cycles and  , therefore, product life cycle planning is critical. At times we may purchase excess components and other materials used in the manufacture and assembly of our products or we may manufacture finished products in excess of demand. In addition, components, materials and products may become obsolete earlier than expected. These circumstances may require us to record inventory reserves and provisions for expected losses on non-cancellable purchase commitments. When these circumstances are present, we may also incur additional expense as we adjust our supply chain and product life-cycle planning.   

21

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our gross profit was 16.3% compared to 26.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our gross profit was 16.2% compared to 18.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These declines in gross profit were primarily due to sales of excess inventory at reduced prices and higher charges of inventory reserves taken in the applicable periods.  
      
  Operating expenses declined by $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The principal reasons for the decline in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, were a $1.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense resulting from a reversal of expense for the forfeiture of unvested stock options by former employees; a $255,000 decrease in depreciation and amortization resulting from continued use of our existing property and equipment, which we elected not to replace as part of our cost cutting initiatives; a $167,000 decrease in bad debt expense resulting from improved collections; and a $150,000 decrease in travel and entertainment expense resulting from our cost cutting initiatives. Those reductions in expenses were partially offset by a $370,000 increase in distribution expense as a result of consolidating our Dallas warehouse into our Seattle warehouse. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, operating expenses declined by $4.1 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The primary reasons for the decline in operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, were a $1.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $1.0 million decrease in employee compensation expense as a result of lower headcount, a $945,000 decrease in professional fees such as legal and consulting expenses, an $836,000 decrease in depreciation and amortization, and an $832,000 decrease in administrative and travel expenses. Those reductions in expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in distribution expense.   
       
    Non-GAAP Financial Measures         
     
  Although our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ), we believe the following non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information that is useful to the assessment of our operating performance and trends. As part of our on-going review of financial information related to our business, our management regularly uses non-GAAP measures, particularly non-GAAP adjusted operating expense as a percentage of revenue. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, the comparable GAAP financial measures and are intended to supplement our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP.   
     
  We define non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses as total operating expenses less non-cash expenses for stock-based compensation, restructuring expenses and depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $268,000 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and decreased by $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    
     
  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained and our operating environment changes.    
     
  We believe that our critical accounting policies relate to our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 contains a discussion of these critical accounting policies. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015. See also Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as set forth herein.  
     
   Results of Operations    
     
    Three Months Ended     September 30    , 201    6     Compared to the Three Months Ended     September 30    , 201    5    
     
  The following table sets forth statement of operations data and such data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:   

Revenue    
     
  Revenue decreased $5.3 million, or 26.8%, to $14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $19.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was due to a $3.4 decrease in sales to The Home Depot and a $1.9 million decrease in sales to commercial customers for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to sales for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
     
    Cost of Goods Sold    
     
  Cost of goods sold decreased $2.4 million, or 16.4%, to $12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the reduction in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30  , 2015.   Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to 83.7% (or a gross profit percentage of 16.3%) as compared to 73.3% (or a gross profit percentage of 26.7%) for the three months ended September 30, 2015  .   

23

Selling, Distribution and Administrative    
     
  Selling, distribution and administrative expense decreased $1.0 million, or 26.2%, to $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in selling, distribution and administrative expenses was primarily a result of a $1.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $167,000 decrease in bad debt expense and a $150,000 decrease in travel and entertainment expense, which were partially offset by a $370,000 increase in distribution expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
     
    Research and Development    
     
  Research and development expense decreased $365,000, or 61.0%, to $234,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $599,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily a result of a $169,000 decrease in stock-based compensation expense and a $165,000 decrease in employee compensation expense.  
     
    Depreciation and Amortization    
     
  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $255,000, or 53.7%, to $220,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $475,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of our continued use of our existing property and equipment, which we have elected not to replace as part of our cost cutting initiatives.   
     
    Decrease (Increase)     in Fair Value of Liabilities under Derivative Contracts     
      
  The change in the fair value of liabilities under derivative contracts is driven by several factors, including the change in the fair market value of our Common Stock, issuances of our Series J Preferred Stock and changes in the expected volatility of our Common Stock. The decrease in fair value of liabilities under derivative contracts for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.2 million, compared to a decrease of $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decline of $767,000, or 38.2%. The change was due to the decline in the price of our Common Stock in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015, as well as the issuance of Series J Preferred Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016.      
       
    Other Income (Expense), net    
      
  Other income (expense), net increased by $666,000, or 269%, to $418,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from other expense of $247,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other income (expense), net was primarily a result of judgments received during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from successful patent litigation actions against certain individuals and companies that were found to have infringed upon our patents.    

24

Nine     Months Ended     September 30    , 201    6     Compared to the     Nine     Months Ended     September 30    , 201    5    
     
  The following table sets forth statement of operations data and such data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:   

Revenue    
     
  Revenue decreased $18.8 million, or 30.2%, to $43.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $62.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in revenue was due to a $17.4 million decrease in sales to The Home Depot and a $1.3 million decrease in sales to commercial customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
     
    Cost of Goods Sold    
    
  Cost of goods sold decreased $14.2 million, or 28.1%, to $36.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $50.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the reduction in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30  , 2015.   Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to 83.8% (or a gross profit percentage of 16.2%) as compared to 81.4% (or a gross profit percentage of 18.6%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   This decline in our gross profit percentage was due to sales of excess inventories at reduced prices and higher charges of inventory reserves.  
     
    Selling, Distribution and Administrative    
     
  Selling, distribution and administrative expense decreased $2.5 million, or 15.7%, to $13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $15.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in selling, distribution and administrative expense was primarily a result of a $1.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a $746,000 decrease in professional fees, a $724,000 decrease in employee compensation expense and a $547,000 decrease in administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in distribution costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       

Research and Development    
      
  Research and development expense decreased $512,000, or 18.1%, to $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in research and development expense was primarily a result of a $323,000 decrease in employee compensation expense and a $123,000 decrease in stock-based compensation expense.   
       
    Depreciation and Amortization    
     
  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $836,000, or 56.9%, to $633,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of our continued use of existing property and equipment, which we have elected not to replace as part of our cost cutting initiatives.   

25

Decrease (Increase) in Fair Value of Liabilities under Derivative Contracts     
      
  The change in the fair value of liabilities under derivative contracts is driven by several factors, including the change in the total fair market value of our Common Stock, issuances of our Series J Preferred Stock and changes in the expected volatility of our Common Stock. The decrease in fair value of liabilities under derivative contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $515,000, compared to an increase of $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease in value of $2.0 million, or 134%. The change was due to the decline in the price of our Common Stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as well as the issuance of Series J Preferred Stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      
       
       Other Income (Expense), net    
      
  Other income (expense), net increased by $536,000, or 186%, to $249,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from other expense of $288,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other income (expense), net was primarily a result of judgments received during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from successful patent litigation actions against certain individuals and companies that were found to have infringed upon our patents.    
         
   Liquidity and Capital Resources      
     
  We have experienced significant historical net losses as well as negative cash flows from operations since our inception, resulting in an accumulated deficit of $841.3 million and stockholders  deficit of $565.4 million as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million. Our cash expenditures primarily relate to procurement of inventory, payment of salaries, employee benefits and other operating costs.   
     
  We continue to face challenges in our efforts to achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operations. Our ability to continue to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business, including continued payment to our trade creditors, is dependent upon establishing profitable operations, supplemented by additional funds that we may raise through public or private financing or increased borrowing capacity.   
      
  We believe we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, including approximately $5.0 million of additional capital prior to December 31, 2016. In addition, because our existing revolving line of credit facility expires on April 25, 2017, we are seeking to replace it in order to help fund our operations. Sources of additional capital and/or credit may not be available in an amount or on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. Our complex capital structure, including our obligations to the holders of the outstanding shares of our Convertible Preferred Stock (as defined below) and our Series K Preferred Stock (the  Series K Preferred Stock ), may make it more difficult to raise additional capital from new or existing investors or lenders. If we are not able to raise such additional capital, we may need to restructure or refinance our existing obligations, which restructuring or refinancing would require the consent and cooperation of our creditors and certain stockholders. In such event, we may not be able to complete a restructuring or refinancing on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital when needed, our business, compliance with our credit facilities and future prospects will be adversely affected.    
        
  Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been borrowings from ACF FinCo I LP ( Ares ) under our three-year revolving credit facility with a maximum line amount of $22.5 million (as amended from time to time, the  Ares ABL ), from Medley Capital Corporation ( Medley ) under our five-year $30.5 million term loan (as amended from time to time, the  Medley Term Loan ) and from other previous lenders, as well as sales of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock to, and short-term loans from, affiliates of Pegasus Capital Advisors, L.P. ( Pegasus Capital ), including Pegasus Fund IV, LSGC Holdings, LLC ( LSGC Holdings ), LSGC Holdings II, LLC ( Holdings II ), Holdings III and PCA LSG Holdings, LLC ( PCA Holdings  and collectively with Pegasus Capital, Pegasus Fund IV, LSGC Holdings, Holdings II, Holdings III and their affiliates,  Pegasus ). Pegasus is our controlling stockholder. While Pegasus has led a majority of our capital raises, certain offerings of Convertible Preferred Stock also involved and/or were led by parties other than Pegasus.   

26

We obtained the Medley Term Loan on February 19, 2014. Pursuant to the Medley Term Loan, we are required to achieve a minimum quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio for the preceding 12-month period and to maintain certain minimum quarterly EBITDA levels. We also maintain   $3.0 million in restricted cash subject to a cash collateral dominion agreement pursuant to the Medley Term Loan with Medley.  
     
  We also obtained the Ares ABL on April 25, 2014, and it expires on April 25, 2017. As of September 30, 2016, we had $9.2 million in borrowings outstanding under the Ares ABL and additional borrowing capacity of $861,000  . The maximum borrowing capacity under the Ares ABL is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The Ares    ABL also requires us to maintain certain minimum quarterly EBITDA levels for the preceding 12-month period.    
     
  Since January 31, 2015, we have issued an aggregate of 29,525 Series J Securities to Holdings III and 62 Series J Securities to certain existing preferred stockholders upon exercise of their preemptive rights under the certificates of designation governing the Convertible Preferred Stock. In each case, the Series J Securities were issued at a purchase price of $1,000 per Series J Security, and we received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $29.6 million in connection with these issuances. Each Series J Security consists of (i) one share of Series J Preferred Stock and (ii) one Series J Warrant, which represents the right to purchase 2,650 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $0.001 per share.  
     
  In 2015, our largest customer, The Home Depot, performed a periodic product line review relating to its entire private label LED lighting product offering. Following the line review, we entered into a new supplier buying agreement with The Home Depot, which went into full effect in the second quarter of 2016. Pursuant to this new supplier buying agreement, The Home Depot has elected to purchase certain products previously supplied by us directly from overseas suppliers. Such products represented a significant percentage of our sales to The Home Depot in 2015 and 2014. We were, however, selected to supply certain new products to The Home Depot and will continue to supply certain other products to The Home Depot under our prior agreement. In addition, the terms of the new supplier buying agreement with The Home Depot permit us to pursue opportunities to sell products to specified big box and other retailers, which was prohibited under our prior agreement. Notwithstanding the new supplier buying agreement, as was the case under our prior agreement with The Home Depot, The Home Depot is not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. As a result of the line review, and based on our results through the first nine months of 2016, we expect 2016 sales to The Home Depot to be significantly lower than in 2015.   
    
  In April 2016, Pegasus committed to provide financial support to us of up to $5.25 million, as needed, to fund our operations and debt service requirements through April 2017. The amount of this commitment has been reduced by the $5.0 million of Series J Securities purchased by Holdings III on July 19, 2016, with a remaining commitment of $250,000. The remaining amount of this commitment will be reduced by the amount of any capital provided by other parties (except for draws under the Ares ABL) that is not repayable by us on or before April 14, 2017. We believe that, based upon current financial assumptions and projections, we will require approximately $5.0 million of additional capital from Pegasus or other financing sources to fund our operations through December 31, 2016.    
       
  RW LSG Holdings LLC ( Riverwood Holdings ) and Pegasus each have the right to cause us to redeem their shares of Series H Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series H Preferred Stock ) and Series I Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series I Preferred Stock  and, collectively with the Series H Preferred Stock and the Series J Preferred Stock, the  Convertible Preferred Stock ), respectively, at any time on or after March 27, 2017. If either Riverwood Holdings or Pegasus elects to cause us to redeem our shares of Series H Preferred Stock or Series I Preferred Stock, all other holders of the applicable series will similarly have the right to request the redemption of their shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, Portman Limited ( Portman ) and affiliates of Zouk Holdings Limited, acting together, have a contractual right to require us to redeem their respective shares of Series H Preferred Stock on or after March 27, 2017, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are also required to redeem the outstanding shares of our Series J Preferred Stock (a) subject to certain limited exceptions, immediately prior to the redemption of the Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock or any other security that ranks junior to the Series J Preferred Stock and (b) on November 14, 2019, at the election of the holders of Series J Preferred Stock (a  Special Redemption ). Holders of Convertible Preferred Stock would also have the right to require us to redeem such shares upon the uncured material breach of our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness or the uncured material breach of the terms of the certificates of designation governing the Convertible Preferred Stock.   Depending on whether the Appeal Bond (as defined below) has been drawn or fully released, the Series K Certificate of Designation requires us to redeem the outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or an earlier change of control or  junior security redemption,  which includes events triggering a redemption of the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock.   As of September 30, 2016, in the event we were required to redeem all of our outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Series K Preferred Stock (collectively, the  Preferred Stock ), our maximum payment obligation would have been $540.2 million. We would be required to repay our outstanding obligations under the Medley Term Loan and the Ares ABL prior to the redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2016, we had $39.5 million of aggregate borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities that we would be required to repay prior to any redemption of Preferred Stock.  

27

Any redemption of the Preferred Stock would be limited to funds legally available therefor under Delaware law. The certificates of designation governing the Preferred Stock provide that if there is not a sufficient amount of cash or surplus available to pay for a redemption of Preferred Stock, then the redemption must be paid out of our remaining assets. In addition, the certificates of designation governing the Preferred Stock provide that we are not permitted or required to redeem any shares of Preferred Stock for so long as such redemption would result in an event of default under our credit facilities.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, based solely on a review of our balance sheet, we did not have legally available funds under Delaware law to satisfy a redemption of our Preferred Stock. In addition, based solely on our projected balance sheet as of March 27, 2017, we do not believe that we will have legally available funds on or before March 27, 2017 to satisfy any such redemption of the Preferred Stock.  
     
  The certificate of designation governing the Series H Preferred Stock also provides that upon the occurrence of a  control event,  we must take any and all actions required and permitted to fix the size of our board of directors to a size that would permit Riverwood Holdings (as the primary investor of the Series H Preferred Stock) to appoint a majority of the directors to the board until we satisfy or otherwise cure the obligations giving rise to the control event. A control event occurs if, among other things, Riverwood Holdings exercises its optional redemption right under the certificate of designation governing the Series H Preferred Stock and we are unable to redeem Riverwood Holdings  shares of Series H Preferred Stock. If Riverwood Holdings were to exercise its optional redemption right and a control event were to occur, Riverwood Holdings could take control of the board of directors.   
     
  The certificate of designation governing the Series J Preferred Stock provides that if we do not have sufficient capital available to redeem the Series J Preferred Stock in connection with a Special Redemption of the Series J Preferred Stock, we will be required to issue a non-interest bearing note or notes (payable 180 days after issuance) in the principal amount of the liquidation amount of any shares of Series J Preferred Stock not redeemed by us in connection with such Special Redemption, subject to certain limitations imposed by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders.  
     
  In addition, one of our stockholders, Geveran Investments Limited ( Geveran ), filed a lawsuit against us and certain other defendants seeking, among other things, rescissionary damages in connection with its $25.0 million investment in us. On August 28, 2014, the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida, the court presiding over the lawsuit, issued an Order Granting Plaintiff s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment under its First Cause of Action for Violation of the Florida Securities and Investor Protection Act. On November 30, 2015, the Court entered judgment against the defendants, including us, on a joint and several basis, in the amount of approximately $40.2 million (including pre-trial interest, attorney s fees, and statutory post-judgment interest). Accordingly, we and certain other related defendants, with the assistance of Pegasus Fund IV, posted an appeal bond in the amount of $20.1 million (the  Appeal Bond ) in support of our appeal of the partial summary judgment order. In consideration of Pegasus Fund IV s entry into the Appeal Bond and other related agreements (collectively, the  Appeal Bond Agreements ) and as security for the potential payments to be made to the issuer of the Appeal Bond for draws upon the Appeal Bond, we issued 20,106.03 units of our securities (the  Series K Securities ) to Pegasus Fund IV, with each Series K Security consisting of (a) one share of Series K Preferred Stock and (b) a warrant to purchase 735 shares of Common Stock. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, we believe the court s partial summary judgment award in favor of Geveran was in error and that we have strong defenses against Geveran s claims. However, in the event that we are not successful on appeal, we could be liable for the full amount of the $40.2 million judgment, plus post judgment interest. Accordingly, the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit and disposition of the Appeal Bond could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to raise capital in the future.

Cash Flows    
     
  The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Operating Activities    
    
  Cash used in operating activities is net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain working capital assets and liabilities. Net cash used during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulted primarily from the net loss for the period. The reduction in net cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due to a reduction in the net loss over the comparable periods, as well as lower levels of current assets used to support the on-going operations. More detailed explanations in the levels of activity and changes in accounts balances follow.  
     
  Net cash used in operating activities decreased to $8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $21.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities included certain non-cash reconciliation items consisting primarily of $2.3 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, accretion and interest accrual primarily on the Ares ABL and the Medley Term Loan  , $1.3 million of inventory write-downs and $633  ,000 in depreciation and amortization. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities included certain non-cash reconciliation items consisting primarily of $729,000 in stock-based compensation expense and a $515,000 decrease in fair value of derivative contracts. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included certain non-cash reconciliation items comprised primarily of $2.2 million in amortization of debt issuance costs  , accretion and interest accrual primarily on the Ares ABL and the Medley Term Loan, a   $1.5 million net increase in fair value of derivative contracts, $1.5 million in depreciation and amortization  , a $1.2 million of stock-based compensation expense and $853,000 in inventory write-downs.          

Changes in working capital also contributed to the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In the aggregate, working capital changes provided total cash of $2.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net use of cash of $13.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the working capital changes consisted primarily of cash generated from reductions in inventory and prepaid expenses of $4.4 million and $461,000, respectively. These sources of cash were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in accounts receivable, a $1.0 million decrease in accounts payable and a $356,000 decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities  . For the nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the working capital changes consisted primarily of an increase in inventory of $6.1 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $4.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $2.7 million and a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $1.9 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses of $2.0 million.    
     
    Investing Activities    
     
  Cash used in investing activities relates to the purchase of property and equipment and capitalized patents. Net cash used in investing activities was $826,000 and $340,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to purchases of property and equipment of $411,000 and capitalized patents of $415  ,000. The cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to capitalized patents of $326,000  .   

29

Financing Activities    
     
  Cash provided by financing activities has historically been composed of net proceeds from various debt facilities and the issuance of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. We continue to rely on those sources of cash to fund our operations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $9.9 million and $20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016   included proceeds from the issuance of Series J Securities for aggregate proceeds of $8.0 million and net draws on our lines of credit and other short term borrowings of $2.3 million, which were partially offset by payment of debt issuance costs of $360,000. The cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015   included proceeds from the issuance of Series J Securities in January and September 2015 for aggregate gross proceeds of $21.5 million and net draws on our lines of credit and other short term borrowings of $592,000, partially offset by $1.1 million in fees incurred in connection with the issuance of Series J Securities and $339,000 in debt issuance costs.     
     
   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
     
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
     
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (the  Certifying Officers ), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  
     
  We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the   Certifying Officers, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Certifying Officers, concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level because the ongoing remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses identified in our Annual Report   on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 have not been fully developed and implemented.   
     
    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
     
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   
     
   PART II   OTHER INFORMATION    
     
  Except as listed below, other items in Part II are omitted because the items are inapplicable or require no response.

6.         
 
     Severance : If your employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause, you will receive severance in an amount equal to your then-current monthly Base Salary multiplied by six (6) months, which severance shall be paid to you either (at the Company s sole discretion) in one or more lump sum payments or in accordance with the Company s then-standard payroll schedule. Any obligation of the Company to pay severance to you is expressly conditioned upon your first executing (and not revoking) an agreement, in a form acceptable to the Company, that releases the Company and its affiliates from any claims you might otherwise have against the Company or its affiliates   and pursuant to which you agree not to compete against the Company in accordance with the terms set forth in in your employment agreement (described in Paragraph 11 hereof).      
     
  For purposes of this Paragraph 6, termination by the Company shall be deemed to be for    Cause    if it is, in whole or part, based on: (i) your commission of an act of fraud, malfeasance, recklessness or gross negligence against the Company or any of its personnel, or in connection with the performance of your duties of employment hereunder; (ii) your commission of any act which is materially injurious to the Company, its personnel, its interests or its reputation; (iii) your indictment or conviction for, or plea of no contest to, any felony or any other crime involving moral turpitude; or (iv) your failure to fulfill your duties and /or responsibilities of employment hereunder.

Additionally, you are eligible for paid sick leave and paid holidays. You will be eligible to accrue twenty (20) days of paid vacation per year of employment. Additional details regarding benefits will be provided by the Company s Human Resources department in due course.
