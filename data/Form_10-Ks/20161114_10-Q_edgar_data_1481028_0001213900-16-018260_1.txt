1.  
      BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of S-X
Regulation Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included.  Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2017.  For further information refer to the financial statements
and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.  

Going
Concern   

  The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of
operations, realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying financial
statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company
does not generate revenue, and has negative cash flows from operations, which raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and appropriateness of using
the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, additional cash infusion. The Company has historically obtained
funds through private placement offerings of equity and debt. Management believes that it will be able to continue to raise funds
by sale of its securities to its existing shareholders and prospective new investors to provide the additional cash needed to
meet the Company s obligations as they become due, and will allow the development of its core business. There is no assurance
that the Company will be able to continue raising the required capital.  

2.  
      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

This
summary of significant accounting policies of HyperSolar, Inc. is presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial
statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management, which is responsible for
their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalent    

  The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  

Use
of Estimates   

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements. Significant estimates made in preparing
these financial statements include the estimate of useful lives of intangible assets, and the deferred tax valuation allowance.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Intangible
Assets    

  Intangible
assets consist of patents that are initially measured at the lower of cost or fair value.  The patents are deemed to have
an indefinite life and are not amortized. The patents are assessed annually for impairment, or whenever conditions indicate the
asset may be impaired, and any such impairment will be recognized in the period identified.   

Net
Earnings (Loss) per Share Calculations   

  Net
earnings (Loss) per share dictates the calculation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings
(loss) per share are computed by dividing by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted
net earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased
to include the effect of stock options and stock based awards (Note 4), plus the assumed conversion of convertible debt (Note
5).    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the dilutive impact of the outstanding stock options of 500,000, and the convertible
debt of $1,505,500 converted into shares of common stock have been excluded in the calculation of net earnings per share, because
their impact on the loss per share is antidilutive.   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2015, the dilutive impact of the outstanding stock options of 500,000, and the convertible
debt of $1,090,500 convertible into shares of common stock. The 500,000 stock options, and $300,000 of the convertible debt were
excluded, because their impact were antidilutive. The remaining $790,500 in convertible debt were included in the calculation
of net earnings per share, because their impact was dilutive.   

Stock
based Compensation   

  The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for
services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based
on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board whereas the value of the award is measured
on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and
vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board whereas the
value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement .

      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

Stock
based Compensation  (Continued)  

  date
as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized
over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements
by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the
period of the measurement date.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

  Fair
value of financial instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet,
where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of September 30, 2016, the amounts reported for cash, accrued interest and
other expenses, notes payables, and derivative liability approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.  

We
adopted ASC Topic 820 for financial instruments measured as fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value,
established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes
the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (level 1measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
These tiers include:  

Level
                                         1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active
                                         markets;    

Level
                                         2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly
                                         or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets
                                         or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active;
                                         and    

Level
                                         3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore
                                         requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation
                                         techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.    

We
measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis are as follows at September 30, 2016 (See Note 6):  

The
following is a reconciliation of the derivative liability for which Level 3 inputs were used in determining the
approximate fair value:  

Accounting
for Derivatives    

  The
Company evaluates all of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify
as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument
is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported
in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, the Company uses a probability weighted average
series Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing models to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation
dates.  

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is
evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current
or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of
the balance sheet date.

      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)   

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

  On
August 27, 2014, the Company adopted the amendment to ASU 2014-15 on  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40).  The amendment provides for guidance to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote
disclosures. The amendment requires management to assess the Company s ability to continue as a going concern by
incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. The Company has to define
the term of substantial doubt, which has to be evaluated every reporting period including interim periods. Management has to
provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of its plan, and disclose when substantial doubt is alleviated as
well as when it is not alleviated. The Company is required to assess managements plan for a period of one year after the
financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendment is effective for annual periods ending after
December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe the accounting standards currently adopted will
have a material effect on the accompanying condensed financial statements.  

In
March 2016, FASB issued accounting standards update ASU-2016-09,  Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee
share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of
the accounting for share-based payments award transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments
are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption
is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2016-9 on the Company s financial statements.   

In
March 2016, FASB issued accounting standards update ASU-2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)   Contingent
Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments . The amendments apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors in debt
instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options. U.S. GAAP
provides specific guidance for assessing whether call (put) options that can accelerate the repayment of principal on a debt instrument
meet the clearly and closely related criterion. The guidance states that for contingent call (put) options to be considered clearly
and closely related, they can be indexed only to interest rates or credit risk. Public companies must apply the new requirements
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluation
the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-06 on the Company s financial statements.   

In
August 2016, FASB issued accounting standards update ASU-2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230)   Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented
and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public and nonpublic entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of ASU 2016-15 on the Company s financial statements.   

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a
material effect on the accompanying condensed financial statements.

2015 and was extended to February 23, 2016. A second extension was granted to November 23, 2016. 

On April 9, 2015, the Company entered into
a securities purchase agreement into for the sale of a 10% convertible promissory note (the  April Note ) in the aggregate
principal amount of up to $500,000. The April Note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at a price equal to
a variable conversion price of the lesser of $0.01 per share or fifty percent (50%) of the lowest trading price since the original
effective date of each respective advance or the lowest effective price per share granted to any person or entity after the effective
date to acquire common stock. Upon execution of the securities purchase agreement, the Company received an advance of $50,000.
The Company received additional advances in the amount of $450,000 for an aggregate sum of $500,000. The April Note matured nine
(9) months from the effective dates of each respective advance. A second extension was granted to October 9, 2016. The Company
recorded amortization of debt discount, which was recognized as interest expense in the amount of $41,120 during the three months
ended September 30, 2016. 

On January 28, 2016, the Company entered
into a securities purchase agreement into for the sale of a 10% convertible promissory note (the  January Note ) in
the aggregate principal amount of up to $500,000. The January Note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at
a price equal to a variable conversion price of the lesser of $0.01 per share or fifty percent (50%) of the lowest trading price
since the original effective date of each respective advance or the lowest effective price per share granted to any person or
entity after the effective date to acquire common stock. Upon execution of the securities purchase agreement, the Company received
an advance of $10,000. The Company received additional advances in the amount of $340,000 for an aggregate sum of $350,000. The
January Note matures twelve (12) months from the effective dates of each respective advance. The Company recorded amortization

      CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES  (Continued)  

ASC
Topic 815 provides guidance applicable to convertible debt issued by the Company in instances where the number into which the
debt can be converted is not fixed. For example, when a convertible debt converts at a discount to market based on the stock price
on the date of conversion, ASC Topic 815 requires that the embedded conversion option of the convertible debt be bifurcated from
the host contract and recorded at their fair value. In accounting for derivatives under accounting standards, the Company recorded
a liability representing the estimated present value of the conversion feature considering the historic volatility of the Company s
stock, and a discount representing the imputed interest associated with the embedded derivative. The discount is amortized over
the life of the convertible debt, and the derivative liability is adjusted periodically according to stock price fluctuations. 

6.  
      DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   

The
convertible notes (the  Notes ) issued and described in Note 5 do not have fixed settlement provisions because their
conversion prices are not fixed. The conversion features have been characterized as derivative liabilities to be re-measured at
the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of the Notes issued that were accounted for as derivative liabilities,
we determined that the fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible notes at issuance was $27,360, based upon the Binomial
lattice formula. We recorded the full value of the derivative as a liability at issuance with an offset to valuation discount,
which will be amortized over the life of the Notes.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net loss in change in derivative of $300,207 in the statement
of operations due to the change in fair value of the remaining Notes, for the three months ended September 30, 2016. At September
30, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liability was $6,557,669.  

For
purpose of determining the fair market value of the derivative liability for the embedded conversion, the Company used the
Binomial lattice formula. The significant assumptions used in the Binomial lattice formula of the derivatives are as follows:

Management
evaluated subsequent events as of the date of the financial statements pursuant to ASC TOPIC 855, and reported the following events:  

On
October 1, 2016, the Company issued 11,515,068 shares of common stock upon conversion of a convertible note in the amount of $40,500
in principal, plus $11,318 in accrued interest.  

On
October 19, 2016, the Company issued 17,678,356 shares of common stock upon conversion of a convertible note in the amount of
$63,000 in principal, plus $16,553 in accrued interest.  

On
October 25, 2016, the Company received $60,000 on a securities purchase agreement for the sale of a 10% convertible promissory
note in the aggregate principal amount of up to $500,000. The note is convertible into shares of common stock of the Company at
a price equal to a variable conversion price of the lesser of $0.01 per share or fifty percent (50%) of the lowest trading price
since the original effective date of each respective advance or the lowest effective price per share granted to any person or
entity after the effective date to acquire common stock.

Overview   

Inspired
by the photosynthetic process that plants use to harness the power of the sun to create energy molecules, we are developing a
novel solar-powered particle system that mimics photosynthesis to separate hydrogen from water.  On November 15, 2011,
we filed a patent application to protect the intellectual property rights to the production of renewable hydrogen using sunlight,
water, and carbon dioxide.    

Our
research is centered on developing a low-cost and submersible hydrogen production particle that can split water molecules under
the sun, emulating the core functions of photosynthesis. Each particle is a complete hydrogen generator that contains a novel
high voltage solar cell bonded to chemical catalysts by a proprietary encapsulation coating.  On September 15, 2015,
we announced that we had surpassed the critical voltage (1.5 Volts) threshold to split water molecules for renewable hydrogen
fuel production. We believe this is an extremely important step towards commercialization, as 1.5 V is the minimum voltage needed
to produce hydrogen in real world systems.  

Currently,
the strategy of partnering with both the University of Iowa and University of California, Santa Barbara, has advanced our technology
significantly. Our agreement with the University of Iowa is currently contracted until April 30, 2017. Our agreement with the
University of California, Santa Barbara is contracted through June 30, 2017. We anticipate continuing this strategy of leveraging
our existing relationships, as well as potentially exploring relationships with other leading universities, to continue developing
our technology.   

In
addition to the university teams, in June of 2016, we hired Dr. Joun Lee to be our chief-technologist to work closely with the
teams and drive progress. Dr. Lee is based in the lab at the University of Iowa. Also in August of 2016, we added Professor John
Stickney as Scientific Advisor. Professor Stickney is currently at the University of Georgia within the Department of Chemistry.  

Now
that we have surpassed the 1.5 V threshold required for hydrogen fuel production in real world systems, we will identify the next
steps in terms of scaling up the technology. Following this breakthrough, we will focus our efforts on increasing the hydrogen
production efficiencies of these particles by bonding the ideal fuel production catalyst to the low-cost, high-voltage solar cell.
In order to achieve this, the Company is currently exploring two parallel approaches. The first is to identify materials that
interface with well-known hydrogen production catalysts, such as the platinum on solar particles, to improve sunlight-to-hydrogen
conversion efficiency. The second is to pursue methods that further increase photo voltages of solar particles to greater than
1.7 V which allow integration of cheaper earth abundant catalysts without significant loss in hydrogen production efficiency.  

In
September of 2016, we filed an additional patent with the University of Iowa to protect a novel device that will house solar devices
in water and safely and efficiently separate the hydrogen and oxygen through a membrane system within the device. We released
a video demonstrating a prototype of this device that can be seen here:  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POc341RHWsA feature=youtu.be \  

This
device is designed to be scaled up for commercial size hydrogen generators. We are currently working on a larger version of this
prototype.    

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, deferred tax assets and fair value
computation using the Black Scholes option pricing model. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions, such as the trading value of our common stock and estimated future undiscounted cash flows, that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates, including those for the above-described items, are reasonable.  

Use
of Estimates   

In
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management utilizes estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions relate to recording net revenue, collectability of accounts receivable,
useful lives and impairment of tangible and intangible assets, accruals, income taxes, inventory realization, stock-based compensation
expense, Black Scholes valuation model inputs, derivative liabilities and other factors. Management believes it has exercised
reasonable judgment in deriving these estimates. Consequently, a change in conditions could affect these estimates.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair
value of financial instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet,
where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of September 30, 2016, the amounts reported for cash, accrued interest and
other expenses, notes payables, and derivative liability approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.  

We
adopted ASC Topic 820 for financial instruments measured as fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value,
established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

Management
reviewed currently issued pronouncements during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and does not believe that any other
recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying
condensed financial statements. Pronouncements disclosed in notes to the financials.  

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015.   

Operating
Expenses    

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $162,285 and $143,989 for the prior period ended September 30, 2015.
The net increase of $18,296 in operating expenses consisted primarily of the increase in marketing expense in the amount of $19,269,
an increase in professional fees in the amount of $8,194 with an overall decrease in general and administrative expenses of $9,132.  

Other
Income/(Expenses)    

Other
income and (expenses) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $(398,130) and $2,201,232 for the prior period ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease in income of $2,599,362 in other income and (expenses) was the result of a decrease in net gain
on debt conversion and change in fair value of the derivative instruments of $2,681,579, with a decrease in interest expense of
$82,217, which includes a net change of $92,868 of amortization of debt discount.  

Net
Income/(Loss)    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net loss was $(560,415) as compared to net income of $2,057,243 for the prior period
September 30, 2015. The decrease in net income of $2,617,658 was related primarily to other income and (expenses) due to an increase
in non-cash cost associated with the fair value of the convertible notes, and an overall increase in operating expenses. The Company
has not generated any revenues.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts
receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.  

As
of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $8,399,534 as compared to $7,839,367 as of June 30, 2016. This increase
in working capital deficit of $560,167 was due primarily to an increase in accrued expenses, convertible notes, and non-cash derivative
liability, offset with a decrease in cash, and accounts payable.  

Cash
flow used in operating activities was $165,031 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $119,075 for the prior period
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash used by operating activities was due to an increase in net loss primarily due to
the increase in accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts payable. The Company has had no revenues.  

Cash
provided by financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $120,000 and $150,000 for the prior period
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in financing activities was due to a decrease in financing with convertible notes through
private placements during the current period.  

Our
financial statements as of September 30, 2016 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Liggett   Webb P.A., in their report dated September 20, 2016, on our financial
statements, included an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without
additional capital becoming available. Our ability to continue as a going concern ultimately is dependent on our ability to generate
a profit which is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies
and, ultimately, to achieve profitable operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.  

The
condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations,
realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The accompanying condensed financial statements
do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we did not generate any revenues, incurred a net loss of $560,415, which was primarily associated with the
net change in derivative instruments, and cash used in operations of $165,031. As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital
deficiency of $8,399,534 and a shareholders  deficit of $8,359,190. These factors, among others raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent auditors, in their report on our audited financial statements
for the year ended June 30, 2016, expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to
continue as a going concern and suitability of using the going concern basis is dependent upon, among other things, additional
cash infusion. We have obtained funds from our shareholders and, in the three months ended September 30, 2016, we also obtained
funding through the sale of our securities. Management believes that we will be able to continue to raise funds through the sale
of our securities to existing and new investors. Management believes that funding from existing and prospective new investors
and future revenue will provide the additional cash needed to meet our obligations as they become due, and will allow the development
of our core business operations.  

PLAN
OF OPERATION AND FINANCING NEEDS    

Our
plan of operation within the next twelve months is to further research, develop, and protect our technology.   

We
believe that our current cash and investment balances will be sufficient to support development activity, intellectual property
protection, and all general and administrative expenses for the next six months. We estimate that we will require additional cash
in 2017 based on our current operating plan and condition. We are investigating additional financing alternatives, including continued
equity and/or debt financing.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, revenues or expenses, result of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the Commission's rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

There
was no change to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
