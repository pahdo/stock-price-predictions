 NOTES TO CONDENSED AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 (UNAUDITED) 
   
        Note 1 Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  :  
 Overview 
 Science Applications International Corporation (collectively, with its consolidated subsidiaries, the  Company ) is a leading provider of technical, engineering and enterprise information technology (IT) services primarily to the U.S. government. The Company provides engineering and integration services for large, complex projects and offers a broad range of services with a targeted emphasis on higher-end, differentiated technology services. Each of the Company s operating segments is focused on providing the Company s comprehensive technical and enterprise IT service offerings to its respective customer base. The Company s operating segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment for financial reporting purposes. 
 On May 4, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of privately held Scitor Holdings, Inc. (Scitor), a leading provider of technical services to the U.S. intelligence community and other U.S. government customers.  
 Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying financial information has been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim reporting purposes. References to  financial statements  refer to the condensed and consolidated financial statements of the Company, which include the statements of income and comprehensive income, balance sheets, statement of equity and statements of cash flows. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). All intercompany transactions and account balances within the Company have been eliminated. The financial statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of management include all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation thereof. The results reported in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year and should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 29, 2016. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the financial statements may include, but are not limited to estimated profitability of long-term contracts, income taxes, fair value measurements, fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and contingencies.  Estimates have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information at the time of estimation and actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Changes in estimates of revenues, cost of revenues or profits related to contracts accounted for using the cost-to-cost and efforts expended methods of percentage-of-completion accounting are recognized in operating income in the period in which such changes are made for the inception-to-date effect of the changes. Changes in these estimates can routinely occur over the contract performance period for a variety of reasons, which include: changes in contract scope; changes in contract cost estimates due to unanticipated cost growth or reassessments of risks impacting costs; changes in estimated incentive or award fees; and performance being better or worse than previously estimated. Aggregate changes in contract estimates increased operating income by $5 million ($0.08 per diluted share) and $18 million ($0.26 per diluted share) for the three and nine months ended November 4, 2016, respectively, and increased operating income by $1 million ($0.02 per diluted share) and $9 million ($0.12 per diluted share) for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2015, respectively.

    Reporting Periods  
 The Company utilizes a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to January 31, with fiscal quarters typically consisting of 13 weeks. Fiscal 2016 began on January 31, 2015 and ended on January 29, 2016, while fiscal 2017 began on January 30, 2016 and ends on February 3, 2017. The number of weeks for each quarter for fiscal 2017 and 2016 are as follows: 

Operating Cycle 
 The Company s operating cycle for long-term contracts may be greater than one year and is measured by the average time intervening between the inception and the completion of those contracts. Contract-related assets and liabilities are classified as current assets and current liabilities. 
 Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges 
 Derivative instruments are recorded on the condensed and consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive (loss) income and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions. The ineffective portion of all hedges, if any, is recognized immediately in earnings. 
 The Company s fixed interest rate swaps are considered over-the-counter derivatives, and fair value is calculated using a standard pricing model for interest rate swaps with contractual terms for maturities, amortization and interest rates. Level 2, or market observable inputs (such as yield and credit curves), are used within the standard pricing models in order to determine fair value. The fair value is an estimate of the amount that the Company would pay or receive as of a measurement date if the agreements were transferred to a third party or canceled. See Note 7 for further discussion on the Company s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.  
 Accounting Standards Updates 
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements and some cost guidance included in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts (including significant judgments and changes in judgments) and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Deferral of the Effective Date , resulting in a one year deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09, which will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, using one of two retrospective methods of adoption. The Company has not selected a method for adoption nor determined the potential effects on its financial statements.

 (UNAUDITED) 
   
    In   February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which supersedes the existing lease accounting   standards (  Topic 840  ). Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for all leases with lease terms in excess of twelve months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows ar  ising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as either a finance lease or operating lease.  The criteria for distinction between a finance lease and an operating lease are substantially similar to existing lease guidance for c  apital leases and operating leases. Some changes to lessor accounting have been made to conform and align that guidance with the lessee guidance and other areas within GAAP, such as   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606)  . ASU 2016-02 becomes eff  ective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and will be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the impact on its financial statements from the future adoption of the standard  .  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which provides amendments to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the treatment of the impact from income taxes and their classification in the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 becomes effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. On adoption, the amendments will be applied retrospectively or prospectively based on each amendment s transition requirements. The Company is evaluating the impact on its financial statements resulting from the future adoption of the standard.  
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash , which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 becomes effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and will be applied retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact on its financial statements resulting from the future adoption of the standard. 
 Other Accounting Standards Updates effective after November 4, 2016 are not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 
   Note 2 Earnings Per Share: 
 Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to basic EPS, except the weighted-average number of shares outstanding is increased to include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other stock-based awards. 
 A reconciliation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted EPS was: 

The following stock-based awards were excluded from the weighted-average number of shares outstanding used to compute diluted EPS:

Note 3 Scitor Acquisition: 
 On May 4, 2015 the Company completed the acquisition of Scitor, a leading global provider of technical services to the U.S. intelligence community and other U.S. government customers. The acquisition was funded from cash on hand and increased borrowings. Purchase consideration paid to acquire Scitor was $764 million (net of cash acquired), including $43 million which was deposited to escrow accounts. In August 2015 $3 million was released from escrow to the sellers after finalizing the working capital adjustment and another $13 million was released in September 2016 that was held to secure a portion of the sellers  indemnification obligations. Any remaining amount in escrow at the end of the indemnification period will be distributed to the sellers.  
 The purchase price was allocated among assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value based on the best available information, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company completed its review of Scitor s historical government accounting practices and adjusted the preliminary purchase price allocation to recognize $5 million in additional liabilities for potential questioned costs under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) and $2 million of related deferred income tax assets resulting in a $3 million net increase to goodwill.  The Company has completed the purchase accounting valuation for this transaction and recorded final purchase accounting entries as follows:

At the date of the acquisition, the tax deductible goodwill was $136 million and the tax deductible identified intangible assets were $163 million.  
 The Company incurred $54 million in total costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Scitor. Acquisition-related expenses, all of which were incurred in prior fiscal years, were $28 million including $17 million of deferred financing fees.  
 For the nine months ended November 4, 2016, the Company incurred $10 million of costs in connection with the integration of Scitor, primarily for facility consolidation and severance costs. There were no costs in connection with the integration of Scitor in the three months ended November 4, 2016. For the three and nine months ended October 30, 2015, costs incurred in connection with the integration of Scitor were $1 million and $6 million, respectively, which were primarily for strategic consulting services, facility consolidation, severance costs, and other integration-related costs. For the nine months ended October 30, 2015, acquisition-related expenses were $10 million and there were no acquisition-related expenses incurred in the three months ended October 30, 2015. These costs are included in acquisition and integration costs on the condensed and consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

    The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of Scitor and the Compa  ny for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2015:  

The unaudited pro forma, combined financial information presented above has been prepared from historical financial statements that have been adjusted to give effect to the acquisition of Scitor as though it had occurred on February 1, 2014. They include adjustments for intangible asset amortization; interest expense and debt issuance costs on long-term debt; acquisition, integration, and other transaction costs; and the elimination of intercompany revenue and expenses. 
   Note 4 Stock-Based Compensation: 
 Stock Options 
 During the nine months ended November 4, 2016, the Company granted certain employees 0.3 million stock options with a weighted-average exercise price and weighted-average grant date fair value of $53.79 and $10.20, respectively. These options will expire on the seventh anniversary of the grant date and will vest ratably on each anniversary of the grant date over a three-year period. 
 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) 
 During the nine months ended November 4, 2016, the Company granted certain employees 0.4 million RSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $53.50, which will vest ratably on each anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. 
 Performance Shares 
 During the nine months ended November 4, 2016, the Company granted to certain employees 0.1 million performance share awards with a grant date fair value of $53.34 per award. These awards will cliff vest at the end of the third fiscal year following the grant date, subject to meeting the minimum service requirements and the achievement of certain annual and cumulative financial metrics of the Company s performance, with the number of shares ultimately issued, if any, ranging up to 150% of the specified target shares. 
   Note 5 Income Taxes: 
 As of November 4, 2016, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits included liabilities for uncertainty in income taxes of $4 million, all of which is classified as other long-term liabilities on the condensed and consolidated balance sheets. While the Company believes it has adequate accruals for uncertainty in income taxes, the tax authorities, on review of the Company s tax filings, may determine that the Company owes taxes in excess of recorded accruals, or the recorded accruals may be in excess of the final settlement amounts agreed to by tax authorities. Although the timing of such reviews is not certain, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.

    Provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was 28.3% and 33.6% for the three and nine months ended November   4, 2016, respectively, and 32.1% and 37.5% for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2015, respectively. Tax rates for the three and nine months ended November 4, 2016 were lower than for the three and nine months ended October 30, 2015 primarily du  e to increased research and development credits in the current year. Tax rates for the periods ended November 4, 2016 were lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates due to permanent tax benefits, including the manufacturer s tax deduction a  nd research and development credits.

 The Company s long-term debt as of the dates presented was as follows: 

As of November 4, 2016, the Company has a $1.3 billion credit facility (the Credit Facility), which consists of a $200 million secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), a $660 million secured term facility (Term Loan A Facility), and a $400 million secured term facility (Term Loan B Facility) (together, the Term Loan Facilities). The Revolving Credit Facility capacity is available to the Company through August 2021, but no draws have been made. 
 On August 23, 2016, the Company amended the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Amendment) to extend the maturity of the Term Loan A Facility and the termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility to August 2021, and to transfer $132 million of principal outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility to the Term Loan A Facility. Further, the Amendment lowers the interest rate margins on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facilities, resets the Term Loan A Facility s quarterly principal repayment schedule and eliminates the required quarterly principal repayments for the Term Loan B Facility. The Company recognized $5 million in expenses associated with the amendment, which is included in interest expense and includes $2 million in write-offs of unamortized debt issuance costs. The Company deferred an additional $2 million in financing fees that are amortized to interest expense utilizing the effective interest method. 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear a variable rate of interest based on Eurocurrency Rate or Base Rate, plus applicable margin. Upon the effectiveness of the Amendment, the applicable margin with respect to Term Loan A Facility and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 1.50% to 2.25% for Eurocurrency Rate loans, and 0.50% to 1.25% for Base Rate loans. Interest rate margins for the Term Loan B Facility under the Amendment are 2.50%, subject to a 0.75% floor for Eurocurrency Rate loans or 1.50% for Base Rate loans. Except for the Term Loan B Facility, the applicable margin and commitment fees will vary based on the Company s leverage ratio. 
   
 The Term Loan A Facility principal under the Amendment is repaid quarterly on the  last business day  of each July, October, January, and April, commencing on October 31, 2017 in an amount equal to a specified percentage of the Term Loan A Facility aggregate principal amount outstanding as of August 23, 2016 (1.250% for October 31, 2017 to July 31, 2018; 1.875% for October 31, 2018 to July 31, 2019; and 2.500% for October 31, 2019 until the Term Loan A Facility matures). The Term Loan B Facility principal under the Amendment is payable in full upon maturity.

    The Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries in  cluding a requirement to maintain a Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 until July 31, 2016, and not greater than 3.75 to 1.00 thereafter, and requires the Company   to make an annual prepayment as a portion of its Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).  As of November 4, 2016 the Company was in compliance with the covenants under its Credit Facility.  
 Maturities of long-term debt as of November 4, 2016 are: 

As of November 4, 2016 and January 29, 2016, the carrying value of the Company s outstanding debt obligations approximated its fair value. The fair value of long-term debt is calculated using Level 2 inputs, based on interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company s Term Loan Facilities.  
   Note 7 Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges: 
 The Company s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges consist of: 

(1)     The fair value of the fixed interest rate swaps liability is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the condensed and consolidated balance sheets.  
 (2)     Subject to a 0.75% floor.  
 The Company is party to fixed interest rate swap instruments that are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of the Company s floating rate debt. The counterparties to all swap agreements are financial institutions. See Note 8 for the effective portion of the unrealized change in fair values on cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive loss and the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings for the current and comparative periods presented. There was no ineffectiveness during any of the periods presented. The Company estimates that it will reclassify $6 million of unrealized losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings in the twelve months following November 4, 2016.

    Agreements with Former Parent  
 The Company commenced its operations on September 27, 2013 (the Distribution Date) following completion of a tax-free spin-off transaction from its former parent company, Leidos Holdings, Inc. (formerly SAIC, Inc., collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries,  former Parent ). In the spin-off transaction, former Parent s technical, engineering and enterprise IT services business was separated (the separation) into an independent, publicly traded company named Science Applications International Corporation (formerly SAIC Gemini, Inc.). 
 Former Parent and the Company executed various agreements to provide mechanisms for an orderly transition and to govern certain ongoing relationships between the companies following the separation. The agreements include a Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Master Transition Services Agreement, and Master Transitional Contracting Agreement (MTCA). These agreements generally provide that each party is responsible for its respective assets, liabilities and obligations, including employee benefits, insurance and tax-related assets and liabilities.  The MTCA also governs the relationship between former Parent and the Company with regard to the treatment of contracts, proposals, and teaming arrangements where both companies are or will be jointly performing work after separation. Each of former Parent and the Company indemnify the other party for work performed by it under the MTCA. 
 Contingent losses that were unknown at the time of separation and arise from the operation of the Company s historical business or the former Parent s historical corporate losses will be shared between the parties to the extent that losses in any such category exceed $50 million in the aggregate. If they arise and exceed the $50 million threshold, the Company will be responsible for 30% of the former Parent s incremental contingent losses on corporate claims (and former Parent will be responsible for 70% of the Company s incremental losses on claims relating to operations that exceed $50 million). 
 Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews 
 The Company is routinely subject to investigations and reviews relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect, in particular, to its role as a contractor to federal, state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside of the United States. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency and others, routinely audit and review a contractor s performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of the contractor s compliance with government standards for its business systems. Adverse findings in these investigations, audits, or reviews can lead to criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, and the Company could face disallowance of previously billed costs, penalties, fines, compensatory damages and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies. Due to the Company s reliance on government contracts, adverse findings could also have a material impact on the Company s business, including its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
 The indirect cost audits by the DCAA of the Company s business remain open for fiscal 2011 and subsequent years. Although the company has recorded contract revenues subsequent to and including fiscal 2011 based on an estimate of costs that the Company believes will be approved on final audit, the Company does not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits. If future completed audit adjustments exceed the Company s reserves for potential adjustments, the Company s profitability could be materially adversely affected. 
 The Company has recorded reserves for estimated net amounts to be refunded to customers for potential adjustments for indirect cost audits and compliance with Cost Accounting Standards, which include indemnification obligations owing to former Parent for periods prior to the Distribution Date. As of November 4, 2016, the Company has recorded a total liability of $38 million for estimated net amounts to be refunded to customers for potential adjustments from audits of contract costs. Any additional amounts which may be determined to be owed for periods prior to the separation will be allocated to former Parent and the Company in proportions determined in accordance with the Distribution Agreement.

    Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Engineering,   Manufacturing and Development (BCTM) Program  
 The BCTM program was terminated for convenience by the Department of Defense (DoD) effective in September 2011. From October 2009 through termination, the Company and its prime contractor performed on this program under an undefinitized change order with a provision that allowed the Company to receive a provisional fixed fee (contract profit) lower than the estimated fixed fee due, pending completion of contract negotiations. The Company recognized revenues of approximately $480 million (including provisional fixed fee) from October 2009 through August 2013 under the undefinitized change order. The Company expects that acceptance of the final contract termination proposal will occur in the first half of fiscal 2018.  The Company had an outstanding receivable of approximately $2 million on this contract as of November 4, 2016. 
 Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds 
 The Company has outstanding obligations relating to letters of credit of $9 million as of November 4, 2016, principally related to guarantees on insurance policies. The Company also has outstanding obligations relating to surety bonds in the amount of $18 million, principally related to performance and payment bonds on the Company s contracts. The majority of the surety bonds outstanding were initially obtained by former Parent and the Company is required to satisfy these obligations under the terms of the Distribution Agreement.

        It  em 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements and the related notes. It contains forward-looking statements (which may be identified by words such as those described in  Risk Factors Forward-Looking Statement Risks  in Part I of the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K), including statements regarding our intent, belief, or current expectations with respect to, among other things, trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations (including our financial targets discussed below under  Management of Operating Performance and Reporting  and  Liquidity and Capital Resources  backlog; our industry; government budgets and spending; market opportunities; the impact of competition; and the impact of the Scitor acquisition. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include any discussed in  Risk Factors  in Part II of this report and in Part I of the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to such uncertainties and risks, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake any obligation to update these factors or to publicly announce the results of any changes to our forward-looking statements due to future results or developments. 
 We use the terms  Company,   we,   us  and  our  to refer to Science Applications International Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The Company utilizes a 52/53 week fiscal year, ending on the Friday closest to January 31, with fiscal quarters typically consisting of 13 weeks. Fiscal 2016 began on January 31, 2015 and ended on January 29, 2016, while fiscal 2017 began on January 30, 2016 and ends on February 3, 2017. The number of weeks for each quarter for fiscal 2017 and 2016 are as follows: 

Business Overview 
 We are a leading technology integrator providing full life cycle services and solutions in the technical, engineering and enterprise information technology (IT) markets. We developed our brand by addressing our customers  mission critical needs and solving their most complex problems for over 45 years.  As one of the largest pure-play technical service providers to the U.S. government, we serve markets of significant scale and opportunity.  Our primary customers are the departments and agencies of the U.S. government. Serving our country s national security and civilian markets, along with commercial customers and state and local governments, has afforded us the ability to develop strong and longstanding relationships with some of the largest customers in the markets we serve. 
 Economic Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks 
 In fiscal 2016, we generated greater than 95% of our revenues from contracts with the U.S. government and greater than 60% of our revenues from contracts with the Department of Defense (DoD), including subcontracts on which we perform. Our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending (especially defense spending) and the alignment of our offerings and capabilities with the budget priorities of the U.S. government. While we believe that national security will continue to be a priority, the U.S. government budget deficit and the national debt have created pressure to examine and reduce spending across all federal agencies. Baseline spending for the DoD has been reduced through government fiscal year 2023. Moreover, there may be further changes that negatively impact discretionary spending trends across all government agencies. Adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions could materially impact our business. Some changes that could have an adverse impact on our business are the manner in which spending reductions are implemented (including sequestration), future government shutdowns and issues related to required increases to the nation s debt ceiling.

    The U.S. government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process (including indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), U.S. Gene  ral Services Administration (GSA) schedules and other multi-award contracts) which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. We expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through   a competitive bidding process.  
 Despite the budget and competitive pressures impacting the industry, we believe we are well positioned to protect and expand existing customer relationships and benefit from opportunities that we have not previously pursued. Our scale, size and prime contractor leadership position are expected to help differentiate us from our competitors, especially on large contracts. We believe our long-term, trusted customer relationships and deep technical expertise provide us with the sophistication to handle highly complex mission-critical contracts. SAIC s value proposition is found in the proven ability to serve as a trusted adviser to our customers. In doing so, we leverage our expertise and scale to help them execute their mission. 
 We succeed as a business based on the solutions we deliver, our past performance and our ability to compete on price. Our solutions, inspired through innovation, are based on best practices and technology transfer.  Our past performance was achieved by employee dedication and customer focus. Our current cost structure, as well as our ongoing efforts to reduce costs by strategic sourcing and developing repeatable offerings, is expected to allow us to compete effectively on price in an evolving environment. Our ability to be competitive in the future will continue to be driven by our reputation of successful program execution, competitive cost structure and efficiencies in assigning the right people, at the right time, in support of our contracts. 
 The fiscal 2016 acquisition of Scitor Holdings, Inc. (Scitor) adds differentiated capabilities primarily in the classified work environment, and provides us access to significant portions of the intelligence community market that we did not have previously. Additionally, there is an opportunity to leverage our existing capabilities to provide expanded services to Scitor s customers.  
 Management of Operating Performance and Reporting 
 We manage our business to achieve our long-term financial targets, which we expect to accomplish on average and over time. These financial targets include:  

low single digit annual internal revenue growth percentage,     

margin expansion of 10 to 20 basis points annually, and     

return of capital in excess of operating needs.     

 Internal revenue growth (or internal revenue contraction if negative) is the method by which we evaluate the growth generated by SAIC after acquisitions. We calculate internal revenue growth percentage by comparing our reported revenue for the current year to the reported revenue for the prior year comparable period adjusted to include any pre-acquisition historical revenue of acquired businesses. Internal revenue growth percentage is a non-GAAP financial measure described in more detail in  Non-GAAP Measures  below. 
 Our business and program management process is directed by professional managers focused on satisfying our customers by providing high quality services in achieving contract requirements. These managers carefully monitor contract margin performance by constantly evaluating contract risks and opportunities. Through each contract s life cycle, program managers review performance and update contract performance estimates to reflect their understanding of the best information available. For contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method in which incurred costs or efforts expended are used as a measure of progress to project completion, updates to estimates are recognized on inception-to-date activity, during the period of adjustment, resulting in either a favorable or unfavorable impact to operating income. 
   We evaluate our results of operations by considering the drivers causing changes in revenues, operating income and operating cash flows. Given that revenues fluctuate on our contract portfolio over time due to contract awards and completions, changes in customer requirements, and increases or decreases in ordering volume of materials, we evaluate significant trends and fluctuations in these terms.  Whether performed by our employees or by our subcontractors, we primarily provide services on long-term contracts and, as a result, a significant portion of our cost of revenues fluctuates in concert with the changes in our revenues. We also analyze our revenues by type of cost (labor, subcontractor or materials) in order to understand operating margin because our labor-related revenues are generally more profitable.  
 -16- 
 
   Table of Contents   
 SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
   
  Changes in costs of revenues as a percentage of revenue other than from revenue volume or cost mix are normally driven by fluctuations in shared or   corporate costs, changes in materials order volume, or cumulative revenue adjustments due to changes in contract estimates.      
 Changes in operating cash flows are described with regard to changes in cash generated through the delivery of services, significant drivers of fluctuations in assets or liabilities and the impacts of changes in timing of cash receipts or disbursements. 
 Results of Operations 
 The primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenues, operating income, and cash flows from operating activities. The following table summarizes our results of operations: 

Revenues .   Revenues decreased $22 million     for the three months ended November 4, 2016 as compared to the three months ended October 30, 2015. Newly awarded programs, including the Amphibious Combat Vehicle and GSA Enterprise Operations, generated revenues of $47 million during the current quarter.  This increase was offset by lower material volume on DoD, federal civilian agency and supply chain programs ($39 million), the expected decline in activity on the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) program as we near the completion of the prototyping phase ($4 million) and various other decreases across our contract portfolio due to programs that have ended or have experienced lower activity.       
 Revenues increased $180 million for the nine months ended November 4, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended October 30, 2015.  The increase in revenues was primarily due to revenues earned on contracts obtained through the acquisition of Scitor (which occurred in the second quarter of the prior year period), additional revenues due to one additional week in the current year period ($88 million) and revenues on newly awarded programs ($100 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased supply chain material volume ($77 million), a decrease in activity on the AAV program ($23 million), and various other decreases across our contract portfolio due to programs that have ended or have experienced lower activity.   
 Cost of Revenues.  Cost of revenues decreased     $30     million for the three months ended November 4, 2016 as compared to the three months ended October 30, 2015 in concert with the decrease in revenue volume.  Cost of revenues also decreased due to lower employee benefits expense.  
 Cost of revenues increased $145 million for the nine months ended November 4, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended October 30, 2015.  The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to the inclusion in the current year period of Scitor contracts as a result of the acquisition and an additional week in the current year period.   
 -17- 
 
   Table of Contents   
 SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
   
    Cost of revenues also decreased due to an update to ou  r fiscal 2017 Disclosure Statements that we prepare in accordance with U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards. We classify indirect costs as a cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) in the same manner as such costs are d  efined in our Disclosure Statements. The update resulted in certain types of costs that had previously been included in cost of revenues to be included in SG A ($4 million and $6 million for the three and nine months ended November 4, 2016, respectively);   however, total operating costs were not affected by this change.   
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.  SG A remained consistent for the three months ended November 4, 2016 as compared to the three months ended October 30, 2015. Lower amortization of acquired intangible assets ($5 million) was offset by increased investment in independent research and development (IR D) and higher SG A as a result of the update to our Disclosure Statements.     
 SG A increased $4 million for the nine months ended November 4, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended October 30, 2015. The increase in SG A was due primarily to the update to our Disclosure Statements, increased investment in IR D and higher bid and proposal (B P) activity to address a strong pipeline of opportunities. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of acquired intangible assets.  
 Operating Income.  Operating income increased $10 million from the comparable prior year period to 6.6% of revenues for the three months ended November 4, 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower intangible asset amortization ($5 million), higher net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method ($4 million), lower employee benefits expense and a decrease in acquisition and integration costs.  These increases were partially offset by increased spending on IR D.  
 Operating income increased $37 million from the comparable   prior year period to 6.1% of revenues for the nine months ended November 4, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for using the percentage-of completion method ($9 million), operating income generated on contracts obtained through the acquisition of Scitor, increased revenue volume and lower acquisition and integration costs. These increases were partially offset by increased spending on IR D and B P.   
 Net Income.  Net income for the three months ended November 4, 2016 increased $8 million from     the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased operating income ($7 million, net of tax) and a lower effective tax rate ($2 million), partially offset by increased interest expense due to costs associated with the amendment to our credit facility.   
 Net income for the nine months ended November 4, 2016 increased $23 million from the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased operating income ($25 million, net of tax) and a lower effective tax rate ($7 million), partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of increased borrowings associated with the acquisition of Scitor ($7 million, net of tax). 
 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities.  Cash flows provided by operating activities were $211 million for the nine months ended November 4, 2016, an increase of $93 million from the comparable prior year period. The increase in operating cash flows over the prior year period was primarily due to a net reduction in working capital investments in Marine Corps platform integration and IT services programs ($41 million), lower payments for employee benefits ($23 million) and lower payments for acquisition and integration costs ($9 million). Cash flows were also higher due to the operating activities of Scitor. These increases were partially offset by higher interest payments in the current period as a result of additional borrowings ($14 million).   
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 Internal revenue growth (contraction), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations, definitions, and how we believe these measures are useful to management and investors are provided below.  Other companies may define similar measures differently.

   Table of Contents   
 SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
   
    Internal Revenue Growth.   Internal revenue growth   (or inte  rnal revenue contraction if negative) is utilized to evaluate revenue growth after the completion of acquisitions. Internal revenue growth is calculated by comparing our reported revenues for the current year to the reported revenues for the prior year com  parable period adjusted to include any pre-acquisition historical revenues of acquired businesses.  We adjust current and prior year revenue to exclude the impact of revenue performed by our former parent company, Leidos Holdings, Inc. ( former Parent ) si  nce revenues on pre-separation joint work are recorded equal to cost and are expected to decline over time (See Note 9 of the notes to the condensed and consolidated financial statements for information regarding our separation from former Parent). For fis  cal 2017, a 53-week fiscal year, we have also adjusted revenue to exclude the estimated impact of the additional week in order to facilitate comparison to the prior year period. We estimate the revenue impact of the additional week by dividing the current   year s revenues for the first quarter by the number of days in the first quarter and multiplying that amount by the number of additional days in the first quarter. We believe that adjusting current year revenues to reflect the impact of the additional week   improves comparability since differences in the number of days generally have a direct impact on the amount of revenues earned in our business during the respective periods.  
 We believe internal revenue growth provides management and investors with useful information in assessing trends on how successful the Company has been at growing revenues as we develop our base business and access new markets and capabilities provided by acquisitions.  
 Internal revenue growth for the periods presented were estimated as follows: 

Internal revenue contraction for the three and nine months ended November 4, 2016 was primarily due to lower materials volume.  
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.  The performance measure EBITDA is calculated by taking net income excluding interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and excluding acquisition and integration costs. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that excludes acquisition and integration costs that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance as they relate to the Company s significant acquisition of Scitor.  
 We believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors with useful information in assessing trends in our ongoing operating performance and may provide greater visibility in understanding the long-term financial performance of the Company.  
 -19- 
 
   Table of Contents   
 SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
   
    EBITDA and adjust  ed EBITDA for the periods presented were calculated as follows:  

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended November 4, 2016 increased to 7.7% of revenues from 7.2% of revenues for the prior year due to an increase in net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method and lower employee benefits expense. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended November 4, 2016 increased to 7.5% of revenues from 7.1% of revenues for the prior year due to the acquisition of Scitor, which has a relatively higher EBITDA margin percentage than our historical business and an increase in net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method. 
 Other Key Performance Measures 
 In addition to the financial measures described above, we believe that bookings and backlog are useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our potential future revenues. We also consider measures such as contract types and revenue mix to be useful for management and investors to evaluate our operating income and performance. 
 Net Bookings and Backlog.  Net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenues to be earned in the future from funded and negotiated unfunded contract awards that were received during the period, net of adjustments to estimates on previously awarded contracts. We calculate net bookings as the period s ending backlog plus the period s revenues less the prior period s ending backlog and initial backlog obtained through acquisitions.  
 Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. We do not include in backlog estimates of revenues to be derived from IDIQ contracts, but rather record backlog and bookings when task orders are awarded on these contracts. Given that much of our revenue is derived from IDIQ contract task orders that renew annually, bookings on these contracts tend to refresh annually as the task orders are renewed. Additionally, we do not include in backlog contract awards that are under protest until the protest is resolved in our favor.  
 We segregate our backlog into two categories as follows: 

Funded Backlog.   Funded backlog for contracts with government agencies primarily represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. It does not include the unfunded portion of contracts in which funding is incrementally appropriated or authorized on a quarterly or annual basis by the U.S. government and other customers even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. Funded backlog for contracts with non-government customers represents the estimated value of contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which we are obligated to perform, less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.     

Negotiated Unfunded Backlog.     Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized and from unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA schedules or other master agreement contract vehicles.

   Table of Contents   
 SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
   
    We expect to recognize revenue from a substantial portion of our funded backlog within the next twelve months. However, the U.S. government can adjust the scope of services of or cancel contracts at any time  . Similarly, certain contracts with commercial customers include provisions that allow the customer to cancel prior to contract completion. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs   and fees (contract profit) for work performed.  
 The estimated value of our total backlog as of the dates presented was: 

We had net bookings worth an estimated $1.9 billion and $4.5 billion during the three and nine months ended November 4, 2016, respectively. Total backlog at the end of the third quarter has increased compared to total backlog at prior year end due to several large awards received during the second and third quarters. These awards include the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Integrated Technical Services (HITS) task order, awarded in September, and the Enterprise Applications Service Technologies (EAST) 2 contract, originally awarded in January and, following a protest, upheld in June.  
 Contract Types.  Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract. For a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenues, see  Contract Types  in Part I of the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table summarizes revenues by contract type as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented:  

The contract portfolio acquired from Scitor consists of a higher proportion of cost reimbursable contracts, and a lower proportion of firm-fixed price contracts, than our historical contract portfolio.  
 Revenue Mix.  We generate revenues under our contracts from the efforts of our employees (which we refer to below as labor-related revenues), the efforts of our subcontractors and the materials provided on a contract. Revenues generated from supply chain materials entail the provision of tailored logistics support. Our subcontractor, contract materials, and supply chain materials revenues generally have lower margins than our labor-related revenues. The following table presents changes in labor-related, subcontractor-related and materials-related revenues for the periods presented:

 SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION 
   
    Labor-related revenues increased in the three and nine months ended November 4, 2016   compared to the respective prior year periods primarily due to newly awarded contracts and the acquisition of Scitor (Scitor s revenues are primarily generated through labor and subcontractors). Supply chain materials-related revenues decreased in the thr  ee and nine months ended November 4, 2016 compared to the prior year periods primarily as a result of changes in order volume as a result of a contract loss.  
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our business generally requires minimal infrastructure investment because we are primarily a services provider.  We anticipate that our future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, and contractual and other commitments. We expect to fund these needs with cash on hand, future operating cash flows and, if needed, borrowings under our $200 million Revolving Credit Facility.   
 We use various financial measures when we develop and update our cash deployment strategy, which include evaluating cash provided by operating activities, free cash flow and financial leverage.  When our cash generation enables us to exceed our target average minimum cash balance of $150 million, we intend to deploy excess cash through dividends, share repurchases, debt prepayments or strategic acquisitions. Our dividends and share repurchases are limited under certain leverage ratios, and we may be required to make an annual debt prepayment.  See Note 6 to the condensed and consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report for a more complete understanding of our Credit Facility.   
 Our ability to generate cash in the future depends on our future financial results. Our future results are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors that may be outside of our direct control. Although we believe that the financing arrangements in place will permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions for at least the next year, our future access to, and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions will be impacted by many factors (including our credit rating, capital market liquidity and overall economic conditions). Therefore, we cannot ensure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all. Nevertheless, we believe that our existing cash on hand, generation of future operating cash flows, and access to bank financing and capital markets will provide adequate resources to meet our short-term liquidity and long-term capital needs. 
 Historical Cash Flow Trends 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows: 

Cash Provided by Operating Activities.  Refer to  Results of Operations  above for a discussion of the changes in cash provided by operating activities between the nine months ended November 4, 2016 and the comparable prior year period.  
 Cash Used in Investing Activities.  Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended November 4, 2016 decreased $782 million, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the Scitor acquisition in the prior year period.  
 Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities.  Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended November 4, 2016 was $194 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $556 million during the prior year period. This change is primarily due to proceeds from borrowings obtained to fund the Scitor acquisition in the prior year and the additional plan share repurchases under our publicly announced repurchase program in the current year.

    Critical Accounting Policies  
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed and consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies, as well as the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, gains and losses during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current reasonably available information and, in some cases, are our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and assumptions may change in the future as more current information is available. 
 Management believes that our critical accounting policies are those that are both material to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Typically, the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and complex have to do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no changes to our existing critical accounting policies during the nine months ended November 4, 2016 from those disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.  Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for potential impairment annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.   
 With the completion of the Scitor acquisition in May 2015, we established a new reporting unit (Intelligence Community/Air Force Customer Group) consisting primarily of a majority of the former Scitor business. This reporting unit has a goodwill balance of $482 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that the excess of fair value over the carrying value (the  excess ) for this new reporting unit was approximately 4%, or $30 million. Given the proximity of the impairment testing date to the date of acquisition, a significant excess was not expected for this reporting unit. However, if future operating results are lower than anticipated or there are increases in market participant cost of capital then a reduction in or elimination of the excess and potential impairment charges could result.   There was significant excess associated with the Company s other reporting units as of the annual goodwill impairment test date. 
 Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information on recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of the notes to the condensed and consolidated financial statements contained within this report. 
     Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
 There have been no material changes to our Market Risks from those discussed in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
     Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and have concluded that as of November 4, 2016 these controls and procedures were operating and effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

     Item 1.  Legal Proceedings  
 We have provided information about legal proceedings in which we are involved in our fiscal 2016 Annual Report, and we have provided an update to this information in Note 9 of the notes to the condensed and consolidated financial statements contained within this report. 
 In addition to the described legal proceedings, we are routinely subject to investigations and reviews relating to compliance with various laws and regulations. Additional information regarding such investigations and reviews is included in our fiscal 2016 Annual Report, and we have also updated this information in Note 9 of the notes to the condensed and consolidated financial statements contained within this report, under the heading  Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews.  
     Item 1A.  Risk Factors  
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Report. 
     Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
 Purchases of Equity Securities.  We may repurchase shares on the open market in accordance with established repurchase plans. Whether repurchases are made and the timing and amount of repurchases depend on a variety of factors including market conditions, our capital position, internal cash generation and other factors. We also repurchase shares in connection with stock option and stock award activities to satisfy tax withholding obligations.  
 The following table presents repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended November 4, 2016: 

(1)    
 
 Date ranges represent our fiscal periods during the current quarter. Our fiscal quarters typically consist of one five-week period and two four-week periods.    

(2)    
 
 Includes shares purchased on surrender by stockholders of previously owned shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations related to stock option exercises and vesting of stock awards in addition to shares purchased under our publicly announced plans or programs.    

(3)    
 
 On September 11, 2015 the number of additional shares of our common stock that may be repurchased under our existing repurchase program previously announced in October 2013 was increased by 3.5 million shares, bringing the total authorized shares to be repurchased under the program to approximately 8.5 million shares. As of November 4, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock under the program.
