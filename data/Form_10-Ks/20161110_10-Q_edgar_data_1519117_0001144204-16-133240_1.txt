 1. Organization and Limited Liability Company matters:  

   ATEL 15, LLC (the  Company  or the  Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on March 4, 2011 for the purpose of raising capital and originating equipment financing transactions and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The Managing Member of the Company is ATEL Managing Member, LLC (the  Managing Member  or the  Manager ), a Nevada limited liability company. The Managing Member is controlled by ATEL Financial Services ( AFS ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATEL Capital Group. The Fund may continue until
terminated as provided in the ATEL 15, LLC Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement dated October 28, 2011 (the  Operating Agreement ). Contributions in the amount of $500 were received as of May 3, 2011, which represented the initial Member s capital investment. As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member. The offering of the Company was granted effectiveness by the Securities and Exchange Commission as of October 28, 2011.  

 Through September 30, 2016, cumulative contributions of $66.5 million (inclusive of the $500 initial Member s capital investment), representing 6,653,171 Units, have been received. Through the same date, a net total of $334 thousand of such contributions (representing 46,250 Units) have been rescinded or repurchased (net of distributions paid and allocated syndication costs) by the Company. As of September 30, 2016, 6,606,921 Units were issued and outstanding.  

 The Company is governed by its Operating Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement, the Managing Member and/or its affiliates receives compensation for services rendered and reimbursements for costs incurred on behalf of the Company (See Note 6). The Company is required to maintain reasonable cash reserves for working capital, the repurchase of Units and contingencies. The repurchase of Units is solely at the discretion of the Managing Member.  

 These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

 2. Summary of significant accounting policies:  

 Basis of presentation:  

 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q as mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of the Managing Member, necessary for a fair statement of financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Certain prior period amounts may have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no significant effect on the reported financial position or results of operations.  

 Footnote and tabular amounts are presented in thousands, except as to Units and per Unit data.  

 In preparing the accompanying financial statements, the Company has reviewed, as determined necessary by the Managing Member, events that have occurred after September 30, 2016 up until the issuance of the financial statements. No events were noted which would require additional disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements.

 2. Summary of significant accounting policies: - (continued) 

 Use of Estimates:  

 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from the estimates. Such estimates primarily relate to the determination of residual values at the end of the lease term and expected future cash flows used for impairment analysis purposes and determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and
reserve for credit losses on notes receivable.  

 Segment reporting:  

 The Company is organized into one operating segment for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance. Accordingly, the Company operates in one reportable operating segment in the United States.  

 The primary geographic region in which the Company seeks leasing and financing opportunities is North America. All of the Company s current operating revenues and long-lived assets relate to customers domiciled in North America.  

 Accounts receivable  

 Accounts receivable represent the amounts billed under operating and direct financing lease contracts, and notes receivable which are currently due to the Company.  

 Allowances for doubtful accounts are typically established based upon their aging and historical charge off and collection experience and the creditworthiness of specifically identified lessees and borrowers, and invoiced amounts. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are generally charged off against the allowance on a specific identification basis. Recoveries of amounts that were previously written-off are recorded as other income in the period received.  

 Accounts receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status (i.e., no revenue is recognized) when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with lease or note payments outstanding less than 90 days. Based upon management s judgment, such leases or notes may be placed in non-accrual status. Leases or notes placed on non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual status when the account has been brought current and management believes recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable. Until such time, revenues on operating leases
are recognized on a cash basis. All payments received on amounts billed under direct financing leases and notes receivable are applied only against outstanding principal balances.  

 Financing receivables  

 In addition to the allowance established for delinquent accounts receivable, the total allowance related solely to financing receivables also includes anticipated impairment charges on notes receivable and direct financing leases.  

 Notes are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and/or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the note agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest when due. If it is determined that a loan is impaired with regard to scheduled payments, the Company will perform an analysis of the note to determine if an impairment valuation reserve is necessary. This analysis

 considers the estimated cash flows from the note, or the collateral value of the property underlying the note when note repayment is collateral dependent. Any required valuation reserve is charged to earnings when determined; and notes are charged off to the allowance as they are deemed uncollectible.  

 The asset underlying a direct financing lease contract is considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its net book value. The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the estimated residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s expected holding period and estimates of undiscounted future rents. The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the market place are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a
significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date.  

 Investment in securities:  

 From time to time, the Company may purchase securities of its borrowers or receive warrants to purchase securities in connection with its lending arrangements.  

 Purchased securities  

 Purchased securities are generally not registered for public sale and are carried at cost. Such securities are adjusted to fair value if the fair value is less than the carrying value and such impairment is deemed by the Managing Member to be other than temporary. Factors considered by the Managing Member in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, available financial information, the issuer s ability to meet its current obligations and indications of the issuer s subsequent ability to raise capital. The Company had $166 thousand and $283 thousand of purchased securities at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. The gain on sales or dispositions of investment in securities was $237 thousand during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. There was no gain on sales or dispositions of investment in securities during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The gain on sales or dispositions of investment in securities was $6 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Based upon the Company s review of its portfolio, no fair value adjustment was deemed necessary for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

 Warrants  

 Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are reflected at an estimated fair value on the balance sheet, as determined by the Managing Member. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $1 thousand and $2 thousand, respectively, on fair valuation of its warrants. By comparison, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $6 thousand and unrealized gain of $44 thousand, respectively, on fair valuations of its warrants during the prior year period. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair
value of the Company s portfolio of warrants amounted to $772 thousand and $770 thousand, respectively. There were no exercises of warrants, net or otherwise, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

 Per Unit data:  

 The Company issues only one class of Units, none of which are considered dilutive. Net income (loss) and distributions per Unit is based upon the weighted average number of Other Members Units outstanding during the period.

 2. Summary of significant accounting policies: - (continued) 

 Fair Value:  

 Fair value measurements and disclosures are based on a fair value hierarchy as determined by significant inputs used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs within the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:  

 Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  

 Level 2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.  

 Level 3   Valuation is modeled using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market. These unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  

 The Company s valuation policy is determined by members of the Asset Management, Credit and Accounting departments. Whenever possible, the policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes. Where quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, information from third party remarketing agents, third party appraisals of collateral and/or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly affected by certain of the Company s assumptions, including
discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. Potential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values. As the Company is responsible for determining fair value, an analysis is performed on prices obtained from third parties. Such analysis is performed by asset management and credit department personnel who are familiar with the Company s investments in equipment, notes receivable and equity securities of venture companies. The analysis may include a periodic review of price fluctuations and validation of numbers obtained from a specific third party by reference to multiple representative sources.  

 Recent accounting pronouncements:  

 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 addresses specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the standard and its impact on operations and financial reporting.

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326) ( ASU 2016-13 ). The main objective of this Update is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this Update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a
broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The amendments affect entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the

 contractual right to receive cash. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Management is currently evaluating the standard and its operational and related disclosure requirements.  

 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ). The new standard will require lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases with lease terms greater than 12 months in the statement of financial position. Lessor accounting per ASU 2016-02 is mostly unchanged from the previous lease accounting GAAP. Certain changes were made to the lessor accounting guidance in order to align the lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Similar to the previous guidance,
lessors will classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type. Lessors in operating leases will continue to recognize the underlying asset and recognize income on a straight-line basis. Lessors determine whether a lease is a sale of the underlying asset based on whether the lessee effectively obtains control of the underlying assets. ASU-2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the standard and its operational and related disclosure requirements.  

 In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU 2016-01 ). The new standard provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt
securities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the standard and its operational and related disclosure requirements.  

 In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU-2014-15 ). The new standard provides guidance relative to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2016. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements or related disclosures.  

 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year and in August 2015, issued Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ( ASU 2015-14 ). ASU 2015-14 is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company evaluated the impact of the new standard on its financial statements and has determined that such impact is virtually non-existent as the new revenue guideline does not affect revenues from leases and loans, which comprise the majority of the Company s revenues.

 Pass   Any account whose lessee/debtor, co-lessee/debtor or any guarantor has a credit rating on publicly traded or privately placed debt issues as rated by Moody s or S P for either Senior Unsecured debt, Long Term Issuer rating or Issuer rating that are in the tiers of ratings generally recognized by the investment community as constituting an Investment Grade credit rating; or, has been determined by the Manager to be an Investment Grade Equivalent or High Quality Corporate Credit per its Credit Policy or has a Not Rated internal rating by the Manager and the account is not considered by the Chief
Credit Officer of the Manager to fall into one of the three risk profiles below.  

 Special Mention   Any traditional corporate type account with potential weaknesses (e.g. large net losses or major industry downturns) or, any growth capital account that has less than three months of cash as of the end of the calendar quarter to fund their continuing operations. These accounts deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, those potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the Fund s receivable at some future date.  

 Substandard   Any account that is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Accounts that are so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Fund will sustain some loss as the likelihood of fully collecting all receivables may be questionable if the deficiencies are not corrected. Such accounts are on the Manager s Credit Watch List.  

 Doubtful   Any account where the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Accordingly, an account that is so classified is on the Manager s Credit Watch List, and has been declared in default and the Manager has repossessed, or is attempting to repossess, the equipment it financed. This category includes impaired notes and leases as applicable.

 5. Investment in equipment and leases, net:  

 The Company s investment in equipment and leases consists of the following (in thousands):  

Impairment of investments in leases:  

 Recorded values of the Company s leased asset portfolio are reviewed each quarter to confirm the reasonableness of established residual values and to determine whether there is indication that an asset impairment might have taken place.  

 The Company uses a variety of sources and considers many factors in evaluating whether the respective book values of its assets are appropriate. In addition, the Company may direct a residual value review at any time if it becomes aware of issues regarding the ability of a lessee to continue to make payments on its lease contract. An impairment loss is measured and recognized only if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than their net book value. The estimated undiscounted future cash flows are the sum of the residual value of the asset at the end of the asset s lease contract and undiscounted
future rents from the existing lease contract, if any. The residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset is utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value (as determined by a valuation method using discounted estimated future cash flows, third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets as applicable based on asset type) of the asset and its carrying value on the measurement date. Upward adjustments for impairments recognized in prior periods are not made in any circumstances. As a result of these reviews, management determined that no impairment losses existed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

 The Company utilizes a straight-line depreciation method for equipment in all of the categories currently in its portfolio of lease transactions. Depreciation expense on the Company s equipment was $1.6 million and $2.0 million for the respective three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and was $5.1 million and $6.0 million for the respective nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. IDC amortization expense related to the Company s operating leases and direct financing leases totaled $28 thousand and $83 thousand for the respective three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and $29 thousand and $85
thousand for the respective three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 (see Note 3).  

 All of the Company s leased property was acquired beginning in December 2011 through April 2015.

 Operating leases:  

 Property on operating leases consists of the following (in thousands):  

The average estimated residual value for assets on operating leases was 36% and 43% of the assets  original cost at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily the result of a renewal of an eighteen-month lease over a seven-year period. There were no operating leases in non-accrual status as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

 Direct financing leases:

The useful lives for each category of leases is reviewed at a minimum of once per quarter. As of September 30, 2016, the respective useful lives of each category of lease assets in the Company s portfolio are as follows (in years):  

6. Related party transactions:  

 The terms of the Operating Agreement provide that the Managing Member and/or affiliates are entitled to receive certain fees for equipment management and resale and for management of the Company.  

 The Operating Agreement allows for the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Managing Member and/or affiliates for providing administrative services to the Company. Administrative services provided include Company accounting, investor relations, legal counsel and equipment financing documentation. The Managing Member is not reimbursed for services whereby it is entitled to receive a separate fee as compensation for such services, such as management of investments.  

 Each of AFS and ATEL Leasing Corporation ( ALC ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATEL Capital Group and performs services for the Company on behalf of the Managing Member. Acquisition services, equipment management, lease administration and asset disposition services are performed by ALC; investor relations, communications and general administrative services are performed by AFS.

 6. Related party transactions: - (continued) 

 Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member or its affiliates are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company. These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred. The Managing Member believes that the costs reimbursed are the lower of (i) actual costs incurred on behalf of the Company or (ii) the amount the Company would be required to pay independent parties for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location.  

 During the respective three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Managing Member and/or affiliates earned fees and billed for reimbursements of costs and expenses pursuant to the Operating Agreement as follows (in thousands):  

7. Non-recourse debt:  

 At September 30, 2016, non-recourse debt consists of notes payable to financial institutions. The note payments are due in monthly installments. Interest on the notes range from 2.19% to 3.66% per annum. The notes are secured by assignments of lease payments and pledges of assets. At September 30, 2016, gross operating lease rentals and future payments on direct financing leases totaled approximately $9.9 million over the remaining lease terms and the carrying value of the pledged assets is $22.8 million. The notes mature from 2016 through 2020.  

 The non-recourse debt does not contain any material financial covenants. The debt is secured by a lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions. The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the specific leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items. The non-recourse obligation is payable solely out of the respective specific security and the Company does not guarantee (nor is the Company otherwise contractually responsible for) the payment of the non-recourse debt as a general obligation or
liability of the Company. Although the Company does not have any direct or general liability in connection with the non-recourse debt apart from the security granted, the Company is directly and generally liable and responsible for certain representations, warranties, and covenants made to the lenders, such as warranties as to genuineness of the transaction parties  signatures, as to the genuineness of the respective lease chattel paper or the transaction as a whole, or as to the Company s good title to or perfected interest in the secured collateral, as well as similar representations, warranties and covenants typically provided by non-recourse borrowers and customary in the equipment finance industry, and are viewed by such industry as being consistent with non-recourse discount financing obligations. Accordingly, as there are no financial covenants or ratios imposed on the Company in connection with the non-recourse debt, the Company has determined that there are no
material covenants with respect to the non-recourse debt that warrant footnote disclosure.

 Future minimum payments of non-recourse debt are as follows (in thousands):  

8. Long-term debt:  

 As of September 30, 2016, the $2.1 million of long-term debt consists of a note payable to a lender. Such debt was utilized during the fourth quarter of 2013 to partially fund the marine vessel and related bareboat charter purchased by the Fund and its affiliate, ATEL 14, LLC. The note bears interest at a fixed-rate of 3.5% per annum, to accrue in arrears on a monthly basis. The full pro rata principal amount of $2.1 million plus all outstanding accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $400 thousand shall be paid in one payment of $2.5 million due on May 25, 2019. The note is recourse to the residual value of the vessel
which is expected to be well in excess of the note amount. In addition, the lender has recourse to the Fund s general assets up to $2.5 million. The note does not contain any material financial covenants and is guaranteed as a senior obligation of the Fund.  

 9. Borrowing facilities:  

 Effective May 25, 2012, the Company participates with AFS and certain of its affiliates in a revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders. The Credit Facility is comprised of a working capital facility to AFS, an acquisition facility (the  Acquisition Facility ), Institutional Leasing Sub Facility, and a warehouse facility (the  Warehouse Facility ) to AFS, the Company and affiliates, and a venture facility available to an affiliate. As of September 30, 2016, the Credit Facility is for an amount up to $75.0 million and is set to expire on
June 30, 2017. The lending syndicate providing the Credit Facility has a blanket lien on all of the Company s assets as collateral for any and all borrowings under the Acquisition Facility, and on a pro-rata basis under the Warehouse Facility. Such Credit Facility includes certain financial covenants.  

 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, borrowings under the Credit Facility were as follows (in thousands):  

The Company and its affiliates pay an annual commitment fee to have access to this line of credit. As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate amount of the Credit Facility is potentially available to the Company, subject to certain sub-facility and borrowing-base limitations. However, as amounts are drawn on the Credit Facility by each of the Company and the affiliates who are borrowers under the Credit Facility, the amount

 9. Borrowing facilities: - (continued) 

 remaining available to all borrowers to draw under the Credit Facility is reduced. As the Warehousing Facility is a short term bridge facility, any amounts borrowed under the Warehousing Facility, and then repaid by the affiliated borrowers (including the Company) upon allocation of an acquisition to a specific purchaser, become available under the Warehouse Facility for further short term borrowing.  

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s Tangible Net Worth requirement under the Credit Facility was $10.0 million, the permitted maximum leverage ratio was not to exceed 1.25 to 1, and the required minimum interest coverage ratio was not to be less than 2 to 1. The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants under the Credit Facility with a minimum Tangible Net Worth, leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, as calculated per the Credit Facility agreement of $28.8 million, 0.40 to 1, and 20.43 to 1, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. As such, as of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance
with all material financial covenants, and with all other material conditions of the Credit Facility. The Company does not anticipate any covenant violations nor does it anticipate that any of these covenants will restrict its operations or its ability to procure additional financing.  

  Fee and interest terms   

 The interest rate on the Credit Facility is based on either the LIBOR/Eurocurrency rate of 1-, 2-, 3- or 6-month maturity plus a lender designated spread, or the bank s Prime rate, which re-prices daily. Principal amounts of loans made under the Credit Facility that are prepaid may be re-borrowed on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth under the Credit Facility. Since the effective date of its participation in the Credit Facility (May 25, 2012) through September 30, 2016, the Company has had no borrowings under the Credit Facility.  

  Warehouse facility   

 To hold the assets under the Warehousing Facility prior to allocation to specific investor programs, a Warehousing Trust has been entered into by the Company, AFS, ALC, and certain of the affiliated partnerships and limited liability companies. The Warehousing Trust is used by the Warehouse Facility borrowers to acquire and hold, on a short-term basis, certain lease transactions that meet the investment objectives of each of such entities. Each of the leasing programs sponsored by AFS and ALC is a pro rata participant in the Warehousing Trust, as described below. When a program no longer has a need for short term financing
provided by the Warehousing Facility, it is removed from participation, and as new leasing investment entities are formed by AFS and ALC and commence their acquisition stages, these new entities are added.  

 As of September 30, 2016, the investment program participants were ATEL 14, LLC, the Company and ATEL 16, LLC. Pursuant to the Warehousing Trust, the benefit of the lease transaction assets, and the corresponding liabilities under the Warehouse Facility, inure to each of such entities based upon each entity s pro-rata share in the Warehousing Trust estate. The  pro-rata share  is calculated as a ratio of the net worth of each entity over the aggregate net worth of all entities benefiting from the Warehousing Trust estate, excepting that the trustees, AFS and ALC, are both jointly and severally liable for the pro
rata portion of the obligations of each of the affiliated partnerships and limited liability companies participating under the Warehouse Facility. Transactions are financed through this Warehouse Facility only until the transactions are allocated to a specific program for purchase or are otherwise disposed by AFS and ALC. When a determination is made to allocate the transaction to a specific program for purchase by the program, the purchaser repays the debt associated with the asset, either with cash or by means of proceeds of a draw under the Acquisition Facility, and the asset is removed from the Warehouse Facility collateral, and ownership of the asset and any debt obligation associated with the asset are assumed solely by the purchasing entity.  

 There were no borrowings under the Warehouse Facility as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

12. Fair value measurements:  

 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, only the Company s warrants were measured on a recurring basis. In addition, certain notes receivable deemed impaired were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

 The measurement methodology is as follows:  

 Warrants (recurring)  

 Warrants owned by the Company are not registered for public sale, but are considered derivatives and are carried on the balance sheet at an estimated fair value at the end of the period. The valuation of the warrants was determined using a Black-Scholes formulation of value based upon the stock price(s), the exercise price(s), the volatility of comparable venture companies, and a risk free interest rate for the term(s) of the warrant exercise(s). The calculated fair value of the Fund s warrant portfolio approximated $772 thousand and $770 thousand at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Such valuations
are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  

 The fair value of warrants that were accounted for on a recurring basis as of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and classified as level 3 are as follows (in thousands):

 12. Fair value measurements: - (continued) 

 Impaired notes receivable (non-recurring)  

 The fair value of the Company s notes receivable, when impairment adjustments are required, is estimated using either third party appraisals or estimations of the value of collateral (for collateral dependent loans) or discounted cash flow analyses (by discounting estimated future cash flows) using the effective interest rate contained in the terms of the original loan. During the first nine months of 2015, the Company had recorded fair value adjustments totaling $50 thousand relative to two impaired notes. During the first nine months of 2016, additional fair value adjustments totaling $5 thousand were recorded to further
reduce the cost basis of these notes.  

 The fair value adjustments recorded were non-recurring and were based upon an estimated valuation of underlying collateral. Under the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the fair value of the impaired notes receivable is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The valuation utilizes a market approach technique and uses inputs from third party appraisers that utilize current market transactions as adjusted for certain factors specific to the underlying collateral.  

 The following table presents the fair value measurement of impaired assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the level within the hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):  

The following tables summarize the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used for the Company s recurring and non-recurring fair value calculation categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

 12. Fair value measurements: - (continued) 

The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is made in accordance with the guidance provided by the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions, set forth below for the Company s financial instruments, are made solely to comply with the requirements of the Financial Instruments Topic and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and related notes.  

 The Company has determined the estimated fair value amounts by using market information and valuation methodologies that it considers appropriate and consistent with the fair value accounting guidance. Considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize or has realized in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.  

 Cash and cash equivalents  

 The recorded amounts of the Company s cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of the liquidity and short-term maturity of these instruments.  

 Notes receivable  

 The fair value of the Company s notes receivable is generally estimated based upon various methodologies deployed by financial and credit management including, but not limited to, credit analysis, third party appraisal and/or discounted cash flow analysis based upon current market valuation techniques and market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, which may consider adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary.  

 Investment in securities  

 The Company s investment securities are not registered for public sale and are carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value, as appropriately adjusted for impairment.  

 Non-recourse and Long-term debt  

 The fair value of the Company s non-recourse debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based upon current market borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.  

 Commitments and Contingencies  

 Management has determined that no recognition for the fair value of the Company s loan commitments is necessary because their terms are made on a market rate basis and require borrowers to be in compliance with the Company s credit requirements at the time of funding.

 Statements contained in this Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  ( MD A ) and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing,
and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital. The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee and borrower defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees and borrowers. The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the markets for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms. Investors are cautioned not to attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law.  

  Overview   

 ATEL 15, LLC (the  Company  or the  Fund ) was formed under the laws of the state of California on March 4, 2011 for the purpose of raising capital and originating equipment financing transactions and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The offering of the Fund was granted effectiveness by the Securities and Exchange Commission as of October 28, 2011.  

 Through September 30, 2016, cumulative contributions of $66.5 million (inclusive of the $500 initial Member s capital investment), representing 6,653,171 Units, have been received. Through the same date, a net total of $334 thousand of such contributions (representing 46,250 Units) have been rescinded or repurchased (net of distributions paid and allocated syndication costs) by the Company. As of September 30, 2016, 6,606,921 Units were issued and outstanding.  

  Results of Operations   

 The three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the three months ended September 30, 2015  

 The Company had a net income of $85 thousand and a net loss of $105 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The results for the third quarter of 2016 reflect decreases in both total revenues and total expenses when compared to the prior year period.  

 Revenues  

 Total revenues for the third quarter of 2016 decreased by $294 thousand or 11%, as compared to the prior year period. Such decline was largely due to decreases in operating lease revenues, gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes, and interest on notes receivable, offset in part, by an increase in gain on sales or dispositions of investment in securities.  

 The decrease in operating lease revenues totaled $424 thousand or 17% and was mainly due to run-off and dispositions of lease assets. Gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes receivable decreased by $53 thousand or 96%, largely due to a change in the mix of assets sold. Interest on notes receivables was reduced by $52 thousand or 66%, largely due to the early termination of certain notes. The increase in gain on sales or dispositions of investment in securities totaled $237 thousand, was attributable to the absence of any sales activity in the third quarter of 2015.  

 Expenses  

 Total expenses for the third quarter of 2016 decreased by $484 thousand or 17%, as compared to the prior year period. The net decrease in expenses was primarily the result of reductions in depreciation expense, cost reimbursements paid to the Managing Member and interest expense, offset in part, by an increase in acquisition expense and provision for credit losses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

The decline in depreciation expense totaled $452 thousand or 23% and was largely a result of run-off and sales of lease assets. The decrease in cost reimbursements paid to the Managing Member totaled $79 thousand or 26%, was a result of lower allocated costs based, in part, on the Fund s declining asset base. Interest expense decreased by $37 thousand or 28%, as a result of a $5.1 million reduction in outstanding borrowings since September 30, 2015. Acquisition expense
increased by $49 thousand or 350% due to lower volume of successful business deals. The provision for credit losses increased by $27 thousand or 225%, as multiple outstanding invoices became more than 90 days past due.  

 The nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the nine months ended September 30, 2015  

 The Company had a net income of $162 thousand and a net loss of $349 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The results for the first nine months of 2016 reflect decreases in both total revenues and total expenses when compared to the prior year period.  

 Revenues  

 Total revenues for the first nine months of 2016 decreased by $812 thousand or 10%, as compared to the prior year period. Such decline was largely due to decreases in operating lease revenues, interest on notes receivable, and gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes, offset in part, by an increase in gain on sales or dispositions of investment in securities.  

 The decrease in operating lease revenues totaled $725 thousand or 10% and was mainly due to run-off and dispositions of lease assets. Interest on notes receivable was reduced by $160 thousand or 57%, largely due to the early termination of certain notes. Gain on sales of lease assets and early termination of notes receivable decreased by $93 thousand or 76%, largely due to a change in the mix of assets sold. An almost 40 times increase in gain on sales or dispositions of investment in securities to $231 thousand, was mainly attributable to lower volume of sales activity in the first nine months of 2015.  

 Expenses  

 Total expenses for the first nine months of 2016 decreased by $1.3 million or 16%, as compared to the prior year period. The net decrease in expenses was primarily the result of reductions in depreciation expense, cost reimbursements paid to the Managing Member and interest expense.  

 The decline in depreciation expense totaled $854 thousand or 14%, was largely a result of run-off and sales of lease assets. The decrease in cost reimbursements paid to the Managing Member totaled $349 thousand or 35%, was a result of lower allocated costs based, in part, on the Fund s declining asset base. Interest expense decreased by $103 thousand or 25%, as a result of a $5.1 million reduction in outstanding borrowings since September 30, 2015.  

  Capital Resources and Liquidity   

 The Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.0 million and $5.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The liquidity of the Company will vary in the future, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as lease assets are acquired, as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales.  

 The Company currently believes it has available adequate reserves to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements. The Managing Member envisions no such requirements for operating purposes.

Cash Flows   

 The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands):  

The three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the three months ended September 30, 2015

  Revolving credit facility   

 Effective May 25, 2012, the Company participates with AFS and certain of its affiliates in a revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) with a syndicate of financial institutions. The Credit Facility is comprised of a working capital facility to AFS, an acquisition facility (the  Acquisition Facility ), Institutional Leasing Sub Facility, and a warehouse facility (the  Warehouse Facility ) to AFS, the Company and affiliates, and a venture facility available to an affiliate. As of September 30, 2016, the Credit Facility is for an amount up to $75.0 million and is set to expire on June 30,
2017. The lending syndicate providing the Credit Facility has a blanket lien on all of the Company s assets as collateral for any and all borrowings under the Acquisition Facility, and on a pro-rata basis under the Warehouse Facility. Such Credit Facility includes certain financial covenants.  

28 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

Compliance with covenants   

 The Credit Facility includes certain financial and non-financial covenants applicable to each borrower, including the Company. Such covenants include covenants typically found in credit facilities of the size and nature of the Credit Facility, such as accuracy of representations, good standing, absence of liens and material litigation, etc. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. The Company considers certain financial covenants to be material to its ongoing use of the Credit Facility and these covenants are described below.  

  Material financial covenants   

 Under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain a specific tangible net worth, to comply with a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, and to comply with other terms expressed in the Credit Facility, including limitation on the incurrence of additional debt and guaranties, defaults, and delinquencies.  

 As of September 30, 2016, the material financial covenants are summarized as follows:  

 Minimum Tangible Net Worth: $10.0 million  Leverage Ratio (leverage to Tangible Net Worth): Not to exceed 1.25 to 1  Collateral Value: Collateral value under the Warehouse Facility must be no less than the outstanding  borrowings under that facility  EBITDA to Interest Ratio: Not to be less than 2 to 1 for the four fiscal quarters just ended  

  EBITDA  is defined under the Credit Facility as, for the relevant period of time (1) gross revenues (all payments from leases and notes receivable) for such period minus (2) expenses deducted in determining net income for such period plus (3) to the extent deducted in determining net income for such period (a) provision for income taxes and (b) interest expense, and (c) depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges. Extraordinary items and gains or losses on (and proceeds from) sales or dispositions of assets outside of the ordinary course of business are excluded in the calculation of EBITDA.  Tangible
Net Worth  is defined as, as of the date of determination, (i) the net worth of the Company, after deducting therefrom (without duplication of deductions) the net book amount of all assets of the Company, after deducting any reserves and other amounts for assets which would be treated as intangibles under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), and after certain other adjustments permitted under the agreements.  

 The financial covenants referred to above are applicable to the Company only to the extent that the Company has borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants under the Credit Facility with a minimum Tangible Net Worth, leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, as calculated per the Credit Facility agreement of $28.8 million, 0.40 to 1, and 20.43 to 1, respectively, as of September 30, 2016. As such, as of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all such material financial covenants.  

  Reconciliation to GAAP of EBITDA   

 For purposes of compliance with the Credit Facility covenants, the Company uses a financial calculation of EBITDA, as defined therein, which is a non-GAAP financial performance measure. The EBITDA is utilized by the Company to calculate its debt covenant ratios.

Distributions   

 The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement. The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of January 2012. Additional distributions have been made consistently through September 2016.  

 Cash distributions were made by the Fund to Unitholders of record as of August 31, 2016 and paid through September 30, 2016. Distributions may be characterized for tax, accounting and economic purposes as a return of capital, a return on capital (including escrow interest) or a portion of each. Generally, the portion of each cash distribution by a company which exceeds its net income for the fiscal period would constitute a return of capital. The Fund is required by the terms of its Operating Agreement to distribute the net cash flow generated by its investments in certain minimum amounts during the Reinvestment Period before
it can reinvest its operating cash flow in additional portfolio assets. See the discussion in the ATEL 15, LLC Prospectus dated October 28, 2011 ( Prospectus ) under  Income, Losses and Distributions   Reinvestment.  Accordingly, the amount of cash flow from Fund investments distributed to Unitholders will not be available for reinvestment in additional portfolio assets. The cash distributions were based on current and anticipated gross revenues from the leases and loans acquired. During the Fund s acquisition and operating stages, the Fund may incur short term borrowing to fund regular distributions of such gross revenues to be generated by newly acquired transactions during their respective initial fixed terms. As such, all Fund periodic cash distributions made during these stages have been, and are expected in the future to be, based on the Fund s actual and anticipated gross revenues to be generated from the binding initial terms of the
leases and loans acquired.

  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based upon historical experiences, market trends and financial forecasts, and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable
under the circumstances and at that certain point in time. Actual results may differ, significantly at times, from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

31 

TABLE OF CONTENTS  

The Company s critical accounting policies are described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015.  

    Item 4. Controls and procedures.   

  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   

 The Company s Managing Member s Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Operating Officer ( Management ), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Operating Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of
these disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

 The Company does not control the financial reporting process, and is solely dependent on the Management of the Managing Member, who is responsible for providing the Company with financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Managing Member s disclosure controls and procedures, as they are applicable to the Company, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a  et seq. ) is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

  Changes in internal control   

 There were no changes in the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Managing Member s internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company.
