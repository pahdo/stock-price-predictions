        NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
(UNAUDITED)  
   
  1.  
  Basis of Presentation, Going Concern and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
   
  Organization  
   
 Puradyn Filter Technologies Incorporated (the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, is engaged in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of bypass  oil filtration systems under the trademark Puradyn    primarily to companies within targeted industries. The Company holds the exclusive worldwide manufacturing and marketing rights for the Puradyn products through direct ownership of various patents. 
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of a normal and recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
   
 For further information, refer to the Company's financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  Revenue Recognition  
   
 The Company recognizes revenue from product sales to customers, distributors and resellers when products that do not require further services or installation by the Company are shipped, when there are no uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance and when collectability is reasonably assured in accordance with FASB ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition , as amended and interpreted. Cash received by the Company prior to shipment is recorded as deferred revenue. Sales are made to customers under terms allowing certain limited rights of return and other limited product and performance warranties for which provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements.  
   
 Amounts billed to customers in sales transactions related to shipping and handling, represent revenues earned for the goods provided and are included in net sales. Costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of products sold. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
 The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any cash equivalents. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and notes payable to stockholder approximate their fair values as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, because of their short-term natures.

PURADYN FILTER TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
(UNAUDITED)  

Accounts Receivable  
   
 Accounts receivable are recorded at fair value on the date revenue is recognized. The Company provides allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to repay their obligation. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to repay, additional allowances may be required. The Company provides for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on specific customer identification and historical collection experience adjusted for existing market conditions. If market conditions decline, actual collection experience may not meet expectations and may result in decreased cash flows and increased bad debt expense.  
   
 The policy for determining past due status is based on the contractual payment terms of each customer, which are generally net 30 or net 60 days. Once collection efforts by the Company and its collection agency are exhausted, the determination for charging off uncollectible receivables is made.  
   
  Inventories  
   
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Production costs, consisting of labor and overhead, are applied to ending finished goods inventories at a rate based on estimated production capacity. Excess production costs are charged to cost of products sold. Provisions have been made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their net realizable value.  
   
  Property and Equipment  
   
 Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, except for assets held under capital leases, for which the Company records depreciation and amortization based on the shorter of the asset s useful life or the term of the lease. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment range from 3 to 5 years. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations. Repairs and maintenance charges, which do not increase the useful lives of the assets, are charged to operations as incurred. 
   
  Patents  
   
 Patents are stated at cost. Amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the patents. The estimated useful lives of patents are 17 to 20 years. Upon retirement, the cost and related accumulated amortization are eliminated from their respective accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations.  
   
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  
   
           Management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to result from those assets over the remaining life to the assets  net carrying amounts. If the estimated undiscounted net cash flows are less than the net carrying amount, the assets would be adjusted to their fair value, based on appraisal or the present value of the undiscounted net cash flows.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
(UNAUDITED)  

Product Warranty Costs  
   
           As required by FASB ASC 460,  Guarantor s Guarantees , the Company is including the following disclosure applicable to its product warranties. 
   
 The Company accrues for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty replacement products. The methodology used in determining the liability for warranty cost is based upon historical information and experience.  The Company's warranty reserve is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying condensed financial statements and is calculated as the gross sales multiplied by the historical warranty expense return rate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was no change to the reserve for warranty liability as the reserve balance was deemed sufficient to absorb any warranty costs that might be incurred from the sales activity for the period.  
   
 The following table shows the changes in the aggregate product warranty liability for the nine -months ended September 30, 2016: 

Advertising Costs  
   
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, advertising costs incurred by the Company totaled approximately $0, $761, $318, and $1,433, respectively, and are included in selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.  
   
  Research and Development  
   
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, research and development costs incurred by the Company totaled $4,766, $7,575, $1,647, and $5,870, respectively, and are included in selling and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes . Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. 
   
  Stock Option Plans  
   
 We adopted FASB ASC 718,  Compensation-Stock Compensation,  effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective application method of adoption which requires us to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2005 by recognizing the amortized grant date fair value in accordance with provisions of FASB ASC 718 on straight line basis over the service periods of each award. We have estimated forfeiture rates based on our historical experience. Stock option compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 has been recognized as a component of cost of goods sold and general and administrative expenses in the accompanying financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.

PURADYN FILTER TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
(UNAUDITED)  

The Company leases its employees from a payroll leasing company. The Company s leased employees meet the definition of employees as specified by FASB Interpretation No. 44 for purposes of applying FASB ASC 718. 
   
 Stock options and warrants issued to consultants and other non-employees as compensation for services provided to the Company are accounted for based on the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair market value of the option or warrant, whichever is more reliably measurable in accordance with   FASB ASC 505,  Equity,  and FASB ASC 718 , Compensation-Stock Compensation,  including related amendments and interpretations. The related expense is recognized over the period the services are provided.    
   
  Credit Risk  
   
 The Company minimizes the concentration of credit risk associated with its cash by maintaining its cash with high quality federally insured financial institutions. However, cash balances in excess of the FDIC insured limit of $250,000 are at risk. At September   30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Company did not have cash balances above the FDIC insured limit. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its significant trade accounts receivable customers and generally does not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained against trade accounts receivable at levels which management believes is sufficient to cover probable credit losses. The Company also has some customer concentrations, and the loss of business from one or a combination of these significant customers, or an unexpected deterioration in their financial condition, could adversely affect the Company s operations.  Please refer to Note 14 for further details. 
   
  Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share  
   
           FASB ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share , requires a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share. However, because of the Company's net losses, the effect of outstanding stock options and warrants would be anti-dilutive and, accordingly, is excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share. The number of such shares excluded from the computation of loss per share were 5,241,196 and 4,970,415 for the  nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   
  Reclassifications  
   
           Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
                     In July 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory   more closely align the measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  The amendments in this ASU do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. For public business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

PURADYN FILTER TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
(UNAUDITED)  

In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   defers the effective date ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. All other entities also may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
   
 All other newly issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable. 
   
  2.   
  Going Concern   
   
 The Company's financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained losses since inception and used net cash in operations of $1,045,567 and $899,001 during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, the Company has had to rely principally on stockholder loans to fund its activities to date. The principal stockholder has recently advised the Company that he does not expect to continue to provide working capital advances to the Company at historic levels.  If the Company does not raise funds as needed, or if the principal stockholder should discontinue his practice of advancing funds, the Company s existing business and operations will be in jeopardy. 
   
 These recurring operating losses, liabilities exceeding assets and the reliance on cash inflows from two stockholders led the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Liggett   Webb, P.A., to include a statement in its audit report relating to the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 expressing substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
   
  3.   
  Inventories  
   
 Inventories consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively:

5.   
  Property and Equipment

Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is $5,381, $17,363, $6,491, and $21,899, respectively.  
   
  6.   
  Patents  
   
 Included in other assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are capitalized patent costs as follows: 

Amortization expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $3,395, $10,647, $3,251, and $9,759, respectively.

7.   
  Leases  
   
 The Company leases its office and warehouse facilities in Boynton Beach, Florida under a long-term non-cancellable lease agreement, which contains renewal options and rent escalation clauses. As of September 30, 2016, a security deposit of $34,970 is included in noncurrent assets in the accompanying balance sheet. On September 27, 2012 the Company entered into a non-cancellable six-year lease agreement for the same facilities commencing August 1, 2013 and expiring July 31, 2019. The total minimum lease payments over the term of the current lease amount to $461,116.  
   
  8.   
  Accrued Liabilities  
   
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued liabilities consisted of the following: 

9.   
  Deferred Compensation  
   
 Deferred compensation represents amounts owed to four employees for salary. As there is no written agreement with these employees which memorializes the terms of the salary deferral, only a voluntary election to do so. It is possible that one or more of the employees could demand payment in full at any time. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company recorded deferred compensation of $1,576,542 and $1,609,585, respectively. 
   
  10.   
  Notes Payable to Stockholders   Related Party  
   
 On March 28, 2002 the Company executed a binding agreement with one of its principal stockholders, who is also the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, to initially fund up to $2.5 million.  In March 2003 the Company and its Chairman and CEO entered into a second funding commitment pursuant to which he agreed to fund up to an additional $3 million which was subsequently increased to $3.5 million.  Under the terms of the agreements, the Company can draw amounts as needed to fund operations.

ITEM 2.  
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.    
       
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Business sections in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, this report, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   plan,   project,   continuing,   ongoing,   expect,   believe,   intend,   may,   will,   should,   could,  and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this report. 
   
  Overview   
   
 We focus our sales strategy on individual sales and distribution efforts as well as on the development of a global distribution network that will sell, install and support our product. In the third quarter of 2016, there were a total of 26 distributors, including their branch outlets and dealers that sold the  Puradyn  system in the U.S. and internationally.   
   
 Sales of the Company s products, the Puradyn      bypass oil filtration system and replaceable filter elements, depend principally upon end user demand for such products.  We market our products and their benefits through direct contact efforts with our distributors, direct customers, and original equipment manufacturers.  
   
 DistributionNow (DNOW) joined the Puradyn distributor network earlier in 2016 and we believe that it provides the potential to consistently support our product on a global basis, with 300 locations worldwide.  We believe that the addition of DNOW as a new distributor for the oil and gas services industry increases our potential reach to new markets and customers which we would otherwise not be able to effectively reach.  The majority of our sales to DNOW during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, which represented 34% and 23%, respectively, of our total net sales, are through its main distribution center located in the southwest U.S.  While we believe that the initial rollout of the product through the DNOW distribution channel has been extremely encouraging and these opportunities have led to new orders and evaluations in 2016, there are no assurances we will be able to increase sales in future periods. 
   
 Our marketing efforts target industries and potential customers willing to consider innovative methods to protect their high-value engine assets, to reduce oil maintenance costs, to reduce engine overhaul costs and to reduce engine downtime.  We believe that these businesses are searching for new and progressive ways to better maintain their equipment using bypass oil filtration. While this is a long-term and ongoing process, we believe we have achieved a degree of product acceptance based on the expansion of existing strategic relationships we have with Nabors Industries, Inc., DNOW, and other end-users and distributors, including: 

Continued work on developing a hydraulic filtration system at the request of one of our larger customers, which can handle hydraulic power units with volumes ranging from 88 gal. (333.1 L) to 1,200 gal. (4,542.5 L); and   

Evaluations begun in 2015 in Europe for power generation successfully concluded in mid-2016 and the customer is now purchasing product.  Evaluations in Turkey are still continuing in construction and mining industries.  All reports indicate the test is going well but will continue for the foreseeable future.   

14 

Our revenues historically have not been sufficient to fund our operating expenses.  During the third quarter of 2016 and the nine months then ended we maintained our total operating expenses at approximate 2015 levels. In addition, as described below, certain key employees continue to defer a portion of their cash compensation in an effort to conserve our cash resources. 
   
 Historically, we have been materially reliant on working capital advances from our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to address our liquidity and working capital issues through the utilization of the borrowing agreement with him. During the period ended September 30, 2016 we borrowed an additional $1,113,912 from him, and at September 30, 2016 we owed him $13,038,529 which represented approximately 86% of our total liabilities. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, he has advanced an additional $92,416 in working capital funding and on November 11, 2016 he converted $6,100,000 of principal and interest due him into 20,333,333 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.30 per share. This conversion was at a premium to the market price of our common stock.  The balance of this loan, which is unsecured, matures on December 31, 2017.  While he has continued to fund our working capital needs and extend the due date of the obligation, he is under no contractual obligation to do so.  He has recently advised us he does not expect to continue to provide working capital advances to us at historic amounts or extend the due date of the obligation. If we are unable to meet our obligation to Mr. Vittoria prior to maturity, he has advised us that he may forgive all or substantially all of this obligation.  We also owe certain of our employees $1,576,542 in deferred cash compensation at September 30, 2016, which represents 10% of our current liabilities on that date.  Since 2005, Messrs. Sandler and Kroger, two of our executive officers, and two other employees have deferred a portion of the compensation due them to assist us in managing our cash flow and working capital needs.  As there is no written agreement with these employees which memorializes the terms of salary deferral, only a voluntary election to do so, it is possible the employees could demand payment in full at any time. We do not have the funds to pay these amounts in entirety, and any demand by these officers and employees for full payment would reduce the amount of funds we have available for our operations.  We could be required to pay these obligations at a time when it is disadvantageous for us, and could result in our inability to satisfy our other obligations as they become due.  
   
 Our net sales do not generate sufficient gross margins to pay our operating expenses.  We remain dependent on advances from our Chairman and CEO.  While we have actively been in discussions with third parties to provide working capital to us in the form of equity, debt or a combination of equity and debt, we have encountered resistance from potential investors in part as a result of the amount of debt due Mr. Vittoria.  We are hopeful that his conversion of approximately 46% owed him into shares of our common stock at a price which is effectively 10 times the recent market price of our common stock in November 2016 will provide new paths in our efforts to raise working capital.  If budgeted sales levels are not achieved and/or significant unanticipated expenditures occur, or if we are not able to borrow or raise additional investment capital, we may have to further modify our business plan, reduce or discontinue some of our operations or seek a buyer for part of our assets to continue as a going concern through 2017. There can be no assurance we will be able to raise additional capital or that sales will increase to the level required to break even or generate profitable operations to provide positive cash flow from operations. In the event we are unable to secure needed capital, it is possible that stockholders could lose their entire investment in our company. 
   
  Going Concern  
   
 Our financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred net losses each year since inception and have relied on loans from related parties to fund our operations. These recurring operating losses, liabilities exceeding assets and the reliance on cash inflows from our principal stockholder, as set forth above, have led our independent registered public accounting firm Liggett   Webb, P.A. to include a statement in its audit report relating to our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities when they become due and to generate profitable operations in the future. There are no assurances that we will have sufficient funds to execute our business plan, pay our obligations as they become due or generate positive operating results. 

15 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 1 to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 1 of our notes to condensed financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.  
   
  Results of Operations for the Three-months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three-months Ended September 30, 2015  
   
  Net Sales   
   
 Net sales increased 6% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to a number of customers who purchased the larger product models which are sold at higher prices. We believe certain of our customers and potential customers in targeted markets continue to internally adapt to volatile oil prices and are reluctant to enter into new purchases or evaluations until a certain measure of stability is achieved.  Despite a recent, mild stabilization of oil prices that has brought a modest increase in new unit sales, our net revenues have been declining since 2014 and there are no assurances the increase in sales in the third quarter of 2016 will continue during the balance of 2016 or that we will ever return our net sales to earlier levels, even if oil prices begin rising to 2014 and earlier levels. 
   
  Cost of Products Sold  
   
 Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, remained the same at 22% in the third quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016. We continue to review cost of materials increases, some of which were passed through to our customers as product price increases in the past few years.  
   
  Total Operating Costs  
   
 Our total operating costs declined 5% in the third quarter of 2016 from the comparable period in 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in salaries and wages, and selling and administrative expenses. Salaries and wages decreased 4% from the third quarter of 2015 compared to September 30, 2016. The reduction was attributable to a reduction in staffing.   Selling and administrative expenses decreased by 7% between September 30, 2016 and 2015. The following table sets forth the material cash components of selling and administrative expenses:  

The increase in employee benefits resulted from the impact of vested employee stock option expenses. Travel and marketing expenses increased due to our relationship with DNOW. The decrease in patent costs was due to certain patent annuities reaching full-term and additional patent filings associated with our MTS and future products filed in 2014. Professional fees decreased due to reduced account and legal fees. We anticipate that our selling and administration expenses for the full year 2016 will remain lower than for the full year 2015. 

16 

Interest Expense  
   
 Interest expense increased 24% for the period ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the period ending September 30, 2015 primarily due to higher borrowings. The Company pays interest monthly on the Chairman note at the LIBOR Daily Floating Rate plus 1.4%, which was a weighted average of 2.86% as of September 30, 2016 as compared to 2.58% as of September 30, 2015.  We expect interest expense to decline during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the conversion of a portion of the debt to equity by Mr. Vittoria in November 2016. 
   
  Results of Operations for the Nine-months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine-months Ended September 30, 2015  
   
  Net Sales   
   
 Net sales decreased 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to due to certain customers that had purchased the larger product models and who continue to postpone ordering additional systems earlier in 2016 until oil pricing begins to stabilize and their companies resume production.  
   
  Cost of Products Sold  
   
 Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased by 5%, from 31% in the nine months ended September 30, of 2015 to 26% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is attributable to reduced sales that resulted in increased overhead allocations.  
   
  Total Operating Costs  
   
 Our total operating costs declined 5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015.  Salaries and wages increased 2% from nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to September 30, 2016.  The increase was attributable to a new hire in the first quarter of 2016.   Selling and administrative expenses declined by 7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. The following table sets forth the primary cash components of selling and administrative expenses:  

The slight increase in employee benefits resulted from the impact of vested employee stock option expenses. Travel and marketing expenses increased due to our relationship with DNOW. Professional fees increased as a result of outsourcing IT. The decrease in patent costs was due to certain patent annuities reaching full-term in 2016 against additional patent filings associated with our MTS and future products filed in 2015.  
   
  Interest Expense  
   
 Interest expense increased 25% for the period ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the period ending September 30, 2015 primarily due to higher borrowings.  

17 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 As of September   30, 2016, the Company had cash of $18,738, as compared to $34,471 at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, we had negative working capital of ($1,001,460) and our current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) was 0.51 to 1.  At December 31, 2015 we had negative working capital of ($1,016,765) and our current ratio was 0.49 to 1. The decrease in working capital deficit and increase in current ratio is primarily attributable to the increase in cash and inventories, offset by increases in accounts payable and deferred compensation. 
   
 We have incurred net losses each year since inception and at September   30, 2016 we had an accumulated deficit of $60,988,371. Our net sales are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses. Historically, we have relied on loans from related parties to fund our operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we raised an additional $1,113,912 from stockholder loans and $25,000 from another member of the Board of Directors. Interest expense on our loans was $269,061 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   As described elsewhere herein, we face a number of challenges and do not presently have sufficient capital to pay our obligations as they become due.   
   
  Cash Flows    
   
  Operating activities  
   
 For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 net cash used in operating activities was $1,045,567, which primarily resulted from the net loss, after taxes, of $1,098,403.  In addition to the cash used in funding the operating loss, the utilization of cash in operations is also attributable to the increase in accounts receivable of $139,212, an increase in prepaid expenses of $19,011, decreased deferred compensation of $33,043, which were partially offset by increased accrued liabilities of $22,342, increased accounts payable of $38,092. Further, we reduced inventory by $71,844 as a result of slower than expected sales for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  Net cash used in operating activities was $899,001, which primarily resulted from the net loss of $974,665.  In addition to the cash used in funding the operating loss, the utilization of cash in operations is also attributable to the reduction in accounts receivable of $39,355 and increased inventory of $213,220 as a result of purchases related to our new MTS product line, an increase in prepaid expenses of $21,645, as well as reduced accounts payable of $10,017. The amounts were partially offset by increased deferred compensation of $92,004 and increased accrued liabilities of $11,514. 
   
  Investing activities  
   
 For the nine months ending September 30, 2016, $106,262 was used in investing activities for the purchase of software and capitalized patent costs. For the nine months ending September 30, 2015, $51,641 was used in investing activities for the purchase of software and capitalized patent costs. 
   
  Financing activities  
   
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,136,096 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was composed of $1,113,912 in loans from our stockholders as described above, an unsecured loan from a member of the Board of Directors, totaling $25,000 which was partially offset by $2,816 in payments of capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $997,074 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was primarily composed of $1,000,175 in loans from our stockholders as described above, which were partially offset by $3,101 in payments of capital lease obligations.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 As of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  The term  off-balance sheet arrangement  generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

        ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.    
   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 Our management, which includes our CEO, and our Vice President who serves as our principal financial officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-14(c) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September   30, 2016 (the  Evaluation Date ). Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
   
 Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and our Vice President who also serves as our principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President who serves as our principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

  RISK FACTORS.    
   
 Risk factors describing the major risks to our business can be found under Item 1A,  Risk Factors , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There has been no material change in our risk factors from those previously discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
   We need additional financing which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital as needed, our ability to execute our growth strategy and fund our ongoing operations will be in jeopardy  . 
 Historically, our operations have been financed primarily through a credit line from one of our principal stockholders, as well as short-term loans from other affiliates. Our future capital requirements, however, depend on a number of factors, including our ability to internally grow our revenues, manage our business and control our expenses. We need to raise additional capital to fund our ongoing operations, pay our existing obligations and for future growth of our company. We do not have any commitments for additional capital, and we cannot assure you that any additional capital will be available to us in the future upon terms acceptable to us. We owe our principal stockholder who is an executive and director of our company approximately $7,030,945 million at November 14, 2016.  He has recently advised us he does not expect to continue to provide working capital advances to us at historic levels.  Given our history of losses, debt levels and general uncertainties of the capital markets, we face a number of challenges in our ability to raise capital. If we do not raise funds as needed, or if our principal stockholder should discontinue his practice of advancing funds to us in an amount to pay our operating expenses, our ability to provide for current working capital needs, pay our obligations as they become due, grow our company, and continue our existing business and operations is in jeopardy. In this event, you could lose all of your investment in our Company.

  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.    
   
 On November 11, 2016 the Company and Joseph V.
