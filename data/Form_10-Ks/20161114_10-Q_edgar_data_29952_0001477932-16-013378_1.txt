      Table of Contents               CHINA CHANGJIANG MINING   NEW ENERGY CO., LTD.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (UNAUDITED)               1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES          The accounting policies and methods followed in preparing these unaudited consolidated financial statements are those used by China Changjiang Mining   New Energy Co., Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the  Company ) as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not conform in all respects to the disclosure and information that is required for annual consolidated financial statements. The year-end consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosure required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the most recent annual consolidated financial statements of the Company.     In the opinion of management, all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for fair statement have been included in these interim consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.      (a) Going Concern      The Company had a working capital deficit of $1,236,546 as of September 30, 2016 and had a negative cash flow from operating activities amounted to $88,333 for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016. If the Company cannot generate enough cash flow from its operating activities, it will need to consider other financing methods such as borrowing from banking institutions or raising additional capital through new equity issuance. There are no assurances that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. The Company plans to continue to control its administrative expenses in the coming periods as well as further develop its sales from its main business.     These conditions and uncertainties raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.      (b) Foreign Currency Translation      Exchange rates applied for the foreign currency translation during the period are as follows:     USD to RMB           USD to HKD                        F-5       
      Table of Contents          HKD is pegged to USD and hence there is no significant translation adjustment impact on these consolidated financial statements.     RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into USD at the rates used in translation.      (c) Earnings/Loss per share      Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing earnings/loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed in a manner similar to basic earnings/loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.        (d) Recent Accounting Pronouncements      In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . These amendments provide cash flow statement classification guidance for: 1. Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; 2. Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; 3. Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; 4. Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; 5. Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned Life Insurance Policies; 6. Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; 7. Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and 8. Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control . These amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. If a reporting entity satisfies the first characteristic of a primary beneficiary (such that it is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity), the amendments require that reporting entity, in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary beneficiary, to include all of its direct variable interests in a variable interest entity and, on a proportionate basis, its indirect variable interests in a variable interest entity held through related parties, including related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity adopts the pending content that links to this paragraph in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.                  F-6       
      Table of Contents           2  . LAND USE RIGHTS, NET      The following is a summary of land use rights, net:           The difference for the balance of cost was mainly due to the fluctuation of exchange rate of USD to RMB.     Amortization expenses were $291,811 and $311,639 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      3  . DUE FROM RELATED PARTIES       The balance of $1,144,133 due from related parties included loans of $1,128,043 from related parties and accounts receivable of $16,090 generated from related parties revenues.     (1) Loans from related parties     The loans owed by related parties are unsecured, interest free and not expected to be paid within twelve months from September 30, 2016.     Loan from related parties consists of the following:           In April 2015, Shaanxi Changjiang moved to a new office that is owned by Shaanxi Baishui Dukang Liquor Co., Ltd., a related company. Shaanxi Changjiang is allowed to occupy the space for free.     (2) Sales revenue from related parties     The Company entered into a lease and a complementary agreement with Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd, a company owned by Zhang Hongjun (82% ownership), dated July 26, 2010 and March 25, 2011, respectively. According to the agreements, the use right of a piece of land with the area of 5,706,666.67 square meters was leased to Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd. for traveling and amusement from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2029. The annual rent in US dollars is approximately $1.2 million (equivalent to RMB 7,500,000). As of September 30, 2016, the Company only received rent payment for year 2011 and no any collection afterward. Due to the uncertain collectability, the Company decided to write off all the uncollected receivables related to land lease in the amount of $3,618,818 (equivalent to RMB 22,500,000) and decided not to recognize any revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and thereafter.                  F-7

(Previously Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Spring Lake Park Co., Ltd.), controlled by Zhang Hongjun, the Director and principal shareholder of the Company        $  38,984            $  -                                                          Total         $  519,050            $  510,356                        F-8       
      Table of Contents         Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd., a company owned by Zhang Hongjun (70% ownership) and Wang Shengli (30% ownership), cancelled its registration on April 29, 2016 and agreed to forgive the loan borrowed by the Company. As both Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd. and the Company are under common control of Zhang Hongjun and Wang Shengli, the extinguishment of related party loan is accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control with $55,097 recorded as an adjustment to stockholders' equity (additional paid-in capital).     The office space occupied by Shaanxi Pacific is a property owned by Zhang Hongjun, the Company is allowed to use it for free.     The office space occupied by Changjiang PV is a property owned by Shaanxi Xi Deng Hui Development Stock Co., Ltd., a related party. The Company is allowed to use it for free.      5.   DUE TO SHAREHOLDERS      The balance of $3,136,566 due to shareholders represents the loans owed to the shareholders, which are interest free and unsecured. The management does not intend to repay the loans within twelve months from September 30, 2016.     Due to shareholders consists of the following:            6  . INCOME TAXES      The Company did not have income tax expense or income tax payable due to the use of net loss carryover from prior years.     As of September 30, 2016, the Company had net taxable operating loss carry forwards of approximately $1,616,776. The PRC Income Tax allows the enterprises to offset their future taxable income with taxable operating losses carried forward in a 5-year period. The Management believes that the Company s cumulative losses arising from recurring business in recent years constituted significant negative evidence that most of the deferred tax assets would not be realizable and this evidence outweighed the expectations that the Company would generate future taxable income. The valuation allowance of $404,194 was recorded.     Components of the Company s net deferred tax assets are set forth below:                        F-9       
      Table of Contents           7  . SEGMENT INFORMATION      The Company operated in two reportable segments, Land use right leasing, and Solar PV energy for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company did not recognize Land use right leasing revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 because of the uncertain collectability of the revenues. See Note 3.     Summarized information by business segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows.           The Company evaluates segment performance based on income from operations. As a result, the components of operating income for one segment may not be comparable to another segment.             ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIALCONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       In addition to the historical information contained herein, we make statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are forward-looking statements. Sometimes these statements will contain words such as "believes," "expects," "intends," "should," "will," "plans," and other similar words. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, assumptions about our future ability to increase income streams, reduce and control costs, to grow revenue and earnings, and our ability to obtain additional debt and/or equity capital on commercially reasonable terms, none of which is certain. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors included in our periodic reports with the SEC. Although forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our September 30, 2016 unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this quarterly report and with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015.       Overview       We have transitioned our business from mining to clean new energy, and mainly focus on the solar photovoltaic, or  PV , downstream market at present stage. We are currently in the development stage with the goal of becoming a turnkey developer and Engineering, Procurement and Construction contractor of solar PV energy facilities. We intend to design, engineer, construct, market and sell high-quality PV energy facilities for commercial and utility applications to local markets.      Before June 1, 2012, we were engaged in exploration for commercially recoverable metal-bearing mineral deposits. On June 1, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Xunyang Yongjin Mining Co., Ltd to transfer our mining exploration rights for a cash payment of $2,380,612 (RMB 15,000,000). Further, on December 30, 2013, our subsidiary, Shaanxi Changjiang Mining   New Energy Co., Ltd. ("Shaanxi Changjiang"), entered into Equity Transfer Agreements with each of Zhang Hong Jun, a director of the Company and owner of a controlling interest in the Company (holding 54.42% as of September 30, 2016), and Wang Sheng Li, a director and shareholder of the Company (holding 2.36% as of September 30, 2016), to sell Shaanxi Changjiang's entire 60% interest in Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd., ("East Mining" and formerly referred to as "Dongfang Mining") for a total consideration of $885,696 (RMB 5,400,000). The consideration payable to the Company was used to offset amounts owed to each of the acquirers. Each of the acquirers obtained 30% equity in this transaction.     We also hold land use rights in a land parcel and we lease a portion of the land use rights on the 5.7 square kilometer parcel to Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd (previously Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Spring Lake Park Co., Ltd.), a company with a common control person. The term of the lease agreement is from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2029. Our land use rights are amortized over their 50 year term. The Land use right was our largest asset, with an annual rent of approximately $1.2 million (RMB 7, 500,000).     As of September 30, 2016, we only received rent payment of 2011 and no any collection afterwards. Due to the uncertain collectability, we decided to write off all the receivable related to land lease of $3,618,818 (equivalent to RMB 22,500,000) and decided not to recognize any revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.                  4       
      Table of Contents          The following is a summary of the book value of our land use rights as of September 30, 2016:           Amortization expenses were $291,811 and $311,639 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.     As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,781,403 as of September 30, 2016, which includes net loss for common stockholders of $378,237 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company s operations used cash of $88,333 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     In the past, the Company relied on the loan received from the related parties, and cash generated from operations to meet its operating requirements. Although the Company was successful in the past in obtaining financing, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financings will still be favorable.

      Table of Contents            OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS       We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.       CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS       None       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements.     An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions which are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and affect our financial condition and results of operations.      Revenue Recognition      The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete, both significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred or services have been rendered and accepted, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.     We are currently leasing the land use right to Huanghe for the development and operation of a theme park. We generally collect the annual rent every year, and then recognize land use right leasing revenue over the beneficial period described by the agreement, as the revenue is realized or realizable and earned.     The Company supplied electricity power by its solar PV energy segment. The electricity revenue is earned and recognized upon transmission of electricity to Heyang County Huanghe Bay Resort Hotel Co., Ltd., a related company or the power grid controlled and owned by the respective regional or provincial grid companies.      Related Party      A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, member of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting party might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.                  8

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       Not required for a smaller reporting company.       ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES         Disclosure Controls and Procedures       In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.     Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.      Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures      Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.      Changes in Internal Controls      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting                 9
