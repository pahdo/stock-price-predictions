Note 1     Basis of Presentation    
    
  The information about the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (Bank) included in these unaudited financial statements reflects all adjustments that, in the opinion of the Bank, are necessary for a fair statement of results for the periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed. The results of operations in these interim statements are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent period or for the entire year ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Bank s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (2015 Form 10 K). 
    
  Use of Estimates.   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates, and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income, expenses, gains, and losses during the reporting period. The most significant of these estimates include estimating the allowance for credit losses on the advances and mortgage loan portfolios; accounting for derivatives; estimating fair values of investments classified as trading and available-for-sale, derivatives and associated hedged items carried at fair value in accordance with the accounting for derivative instruments and associated hedging activities, and financial instruments carried at fair value under the fair value option; accounting for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) for investment securities; and estimating the prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and mortgage loans for the accounting of amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on MBS and mortgage loans. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 
    
  Financial Instruments Meeting Netting Requirements.   The Bank presents certain financial instruments, including derivative instruments and securities purchased under agreements to resell, on a net basis when they have a legal right of offset and all other requirements for netting are met (collectively referred to as the netting requirements). The Bank has elected to offset its derivative asset and liability positions, as well as cash collateral received or pledged, when the netting requirements are met. The Bank did not have any offsetting liabilities related to its securities purchased under agreements to resell for the periods presented. 
    
  The net exposure for these financial instruments can change on a daily basis; therefore, there may be a delay between the time this exposure change is identified and additional collateral is requested, and the time this collateral is received or pledged. Likewise, there may be a delay for excess collateral to be returned. For derivative instruments that meet the netting requirements, any excess cash collateral received or pledged is recognized as a derivative liability or derivative asset. Additional information regarding these agreements is provided in   Note 15   Derivatives and Hedging Activities  . Based on the fair value of the related collateral held, the securities purchased under agreements to resell were fully collateralized for the periods presented.  
    
  Variable Interest Entities.   The Bank s investments in variable interest entities (VIEs) are limited to private-label residential mortgage-backed securities (PLRMBS). On an ongoing basis, the Bank performs a quarterly evaluation 
  to determine whether it is the primary beneficiary in any VIE. The Bank evaluated its investments in VIEs as of   September 30, 2016  , to determine whether it is a primary beneficiary of any of these investments. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate a VIE. The Bank determined that consolidation accounting is not required because the Bank is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs for the periods presented. The Bank does not have the power to significantly affect the economic performance of any of these investments because it does not act as a key decision maker nor does it have the unilateral ability to replace a key decision maker. In addition, the Bank does not design, sponsor, transfer, service, or provide credit or liquidity support in any of its investments in VIEs. The maximum loss exposure for these VIEs is limited to the Bank s investment in the VIE.

Interest-bearing Deposits.   This investment provides short-term liquidity and is carried at cost. Interest-bearing deposits include     interest-bearing deposits in banks not meeting the definition of a security. Interest income on interest-bearing deposits is accrued as earned and recorded in interest income on Statements of Income. 
    
  Reclassifications of Prior Period Amounts Related to Concessions on Consolidated Obligations  . On January 1, 2016, the Bank retrospectively adopted the guidance,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on April 7, 2015. The Bank pays concessions to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain consolidated obligations for which the Bank is the primary obligor. The amount of concessions is allocated to the Bank by the Office of Finance based on the percentage of the debt issued for which the Bank is the primary obligor. Concessions paid on consolidated obligations designated under the fair value option are expensed as incurred in non-interest expense. Concessions paid on consolidated obligations not designated under the fair value option are deferred and amortized to expense using the level-yield method over the remaining contractual life or on a retrospective basis over the estimated life of the consolidated obligations. The amortization of those concessions is included in consolidated obligation interest expense. Unamortized concessions were   $7   and   $9   at   September 30, 2016  , and December 31, 2015, respectively. Prior to the adoption of the guidance unamortized concessions were included in  Other assets.  Upon adoption of the guidance, unamortized concessions were reclassified as a reduction in the balance of the corresponding consolidated obligations, consistent with the presentation of discounts on consolidated obligations. 
    
  As a result of adopting this guidance,   $9   of unamortized concessions included in  Other assets  at December 31, 2015, was reclassified as a reduction in the balance of the corresponding consolidated obligations to conform to the financial statement presentation on the Bank s Statements of Condition as of   September 30, 2016  . The reclassification resulted in a decrease of   $1   in  Consolidated obligation discount notes  and of   $8   in  Consolidated obligation bonds  at December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the Bank s total assets and total liabilities each decreased by   $9   at December 31, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have any effect on the Bank s results of operations and cash flows.  
    
  Descriptions of the Bank s significant accounting policies are included in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. Other changes to these policies as of   September 30, 2016  , are discussed in   Note 2   Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance  . 

Note 2     Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance    
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the Statements of Cash Flows. This guidance is intended to reduce existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the Statements of Cash Flows. This guidance is effective for the Bank for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on the Bank s cash flows has not yet been determined. The adoption of this guidance will have no effect on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. 
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The amendments require entities to measure expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate under the circumstances. In addition, under the new guidance, a financial  
  
   10 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

asset, or a group of financial assets, is required to be measured at its amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected over the contractual term of the financial assets. Among other things, the guidance also requires: 
             
    The statement of income to reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. 
                
    The entities to determine the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination that are measured at amortized cost basis in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost basis. The initial allowance for credit losses is required to be added to the purchase price. 
                
    Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The amendments limit the allowance for credit losses to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. 
                
    Public entities to further disaggregate the current disclosure of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables by the year of origination (i.e., vintage). 
       
  The guidance is effective for the Bank for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2020. Early application is permitted as of the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The guidance should be applied using a modified-retrospective approach, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. In addition, the entities are required to use a prospective transition approach for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination and for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows has not yet been determined.  
  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments.   On March 14, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. The guidance requires entities to apply only the four-step decision sequence when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts. Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. This guidance becomes effective for the Bank for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the period for which the amendments are effective. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, but its effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is not expected to be material. 
    
  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.   On March 10, 2016, the FASB issued amendments to clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under U.S. GAAP does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. This guidance becomes effective for the Bank for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The amendments provide entities with the option to apply the guidance using either a prospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, retrospectively applied to all derivative instruments that meet the specific conditions. The Bank elected to early adopt the guidance prospectively on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Recognition of Lease Assets and Lease Liabilities.   On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the Statements of Condition and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. In particular, this guidance requires a lessee of operating or finance leases to recognize on the Statements of Condition a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. However, for leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Under previous U.S. GAAP, a lessee was not required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the Statements of Condition. While this guidance does not fundamentally change lessor accounting, some changes have been made to align that guidance with the lessee guidance and other areas within U.S. GAAP. 
    
  The guidance becomes effective for the Bank for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2019, and early application is permitted. The guidance requires lessors and lessees to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements using a modified retrospective approach. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows has not yet been determined. 
    
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This guidance includes, but is not limited to, the following:  
             
    Requires equity investments (with certain exceptions) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 
                
    Requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; 
                
    Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the Statement of Condition or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements; 
                
    Eliminates the requirement for public entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the Statement of Condition. 
       
  The guidance becomes effective for the Bank for the interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2018, and early adoption is only permitted for certain provisions. The amendments, in general, should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Statement of Condition as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance, and its effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows has not yet been determined.  
    
  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.   On April 15, 2015, the FASB issued amendments to clarify a customer s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendments provide guidance to customers on determining whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license that should be accounted for as internal-use software. If the arrangement does not contain a software license, it would be accounted for as a service contract. This guidance became effective for the Bank for the interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2016, and was adopted prospectively. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  
    
  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the Statements of Condition as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of unamortized debt issuance costs from other assets to consolidated obligations on the Bank s Statements of Condition. This guidance became effective for the Bank for the interim and annual periods beginning  
  
   12 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

January 1, 2016, and was adopted retrospectively. See   Note 1   Basis of Presentation   for discussion of the impact of reclassifications of prior period amounts. 
    
  Amendments to the Consolidation Guidance.   On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued guidance intended to enhance consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions). The new guidance primarily focuses on the following:  
             
    Placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. A reporting organization may no longer have to consolidate a legal entity in certain circumstances based solely on its fee arrangement, when certain criteria are met. 
                
    Reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial interest in a VIE. 
                
    Potentially changing consolidation conclusions for public and private companies in several industries that typically make use of limited partnerships or VIEs. 
       
  This guidance became effective for the Bank for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance had no effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.     On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This guidance requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or within one year after the financial statements are available to be issued, when applicable. Substantial doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations for the assessed period. This guidance becomes effective for the Bank for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for the annual and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. This guidance is not expected to affect the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued its guidance on revenue from contracts with customers. This guidance outlines a comprehensive model for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. In addition, this guidance amends the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of non-financial assets that are not in a contract with a customer. This guidance applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of certain other standards, such as financial instruments, certain guarantees, insurance contracts, and lease contracts.  
    
  The guidance provides entities with the option of using either of the following adoption methods: a full retrospective method, applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented; or a modified retrospective method, with the cumulative effect of retrospectively applying this guidance recognized at the date of initial application. The Bank is in the process of evaluating this guidance and its effect on the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, but it is not expected to be material. 
    
  On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date of the guidance issued in May 2014 by one year. In 2016, the FASB has issued additional amendments to clarify certain aspects of the new revenue guidance. However, the amendments do not change the core principle in the new revenue standard. The guidance is effective for the Bank for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted only as of the interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.

Note 3     Trading Securities    
    
  The estimated fair value of trading securities as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , was as follows: 

The net unrealized gain/(loss) on trading securities was   $1   and   $(1)   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The net unrealized gain/(loss) on trading securities was   $3   and   $(1)   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts represent the changes in the fair value of the securities during the reported periods.  

Note 4     Available-for-Sale Securities    
    
  Available-for-sale (AFS) securities by major security type as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows:   

(1) 
    Amortized cost includes unpaid principal balance, unamortized premiums and discounts  , and previous OTTI recognized in earnings. 
       
  Expected maturities of PLRMBS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers generally have the right to prepay the underlying obligations without prepayment fees. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the amortized cost of the Bank s PLRMBS classified as AFS included credit-related OTTI of   $973  . At   December 31, 2015  , the amortized cost of the Bank s PLRMBS classified as AFS included credit-related OTTI of   $1,023  . 
    
  The following table summarizes the AFS securities with unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . The unrealized losses are aggregated by major security type and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. Total unrealized losses in the following table will not agree to total gross unrealized losses in the table above. The unrealized losses in the following table also include non-credit-related OTTI losses recognized in AOCI.

As indicated in the tables above, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s investments classified as AFS had unrealized losses related to PLRMBS, which were primarily due to illiquidity in the PLRMBS market and market expectations of the credit performance of loan collateral underlying these securities, which caused these assets to be valued at discounts to their amortized cost.  
    
  Interest Rate Payment Terms.   Interest rate payment terms for AFS securities at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are shown in the following table: 

Certain MBS classified as fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations have an initial fixed interest rate that subsequently converts to an adjustable interest rate on a specified date as follows:

At   September 30, 2016  , the amortized cost of the Bank s MBS classified as HTM included premiums of   $27  , discounts of   $32  , and credit-related OTTI of   $8  . At   December 31, 2015  , the amortized cost of the Bank s MBS classified as HTM included premiums of   $39  , discounts of   $42  , and credit-related OTTI of   $8  .  
    
  The following tables summarize the HTM securities with unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . The unrealized losses are aggregated by major security type and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. Total unrealized losses in the following table will not agree to the total gross unrecognized holding losses in the table above. The unrealized losses in the following table also include non-credit-related OTTI losses recognized in AOCI. For OTTI analysis of HTM securities, see   Note 6   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis  .

As indicated in the tables above, the Bank s investments classified as HTM had unrealized losses on CalHFA bonds and MBS. The unrealized losses associated with the CalHFA bonds were mainly due to an illiquid market, credit concerns regarding the underlying mortgage collateral, and credit concerns regarding the monoline insurance providers, causing these investments to be valued at a discount to their acquisition cost. For its agency MBS, the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities because the Bank determined that the strength of the issuers  guarantees through direct obligations or support from the U.S. government is sufficient to protect the Bank from losses. The unrealized losses associated with the PLRMBS were primarily due to illiquidity in the PLRMBS market and market expectations of the credit performance of loan collateral underlying these securities, which caused these assets to be valued at discounts to their amortized cost.  
    
  Redemption Terms.   The amortized cost, carrying value, and estimated fair value of non-MBS securities by contractual maturity (based on contractual final principal payment) and of MBS as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are shown below. Expected maturities of MBS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers generally have the right to prepay the underlying obligations without prepayment fees.

(1) 
    Amortized cost includes unpaid principal balance, unamortized premiums and discounts, and previous OTTI recognized in earnings. The carrying value of HTM securities represents amortized cost after adjustment for non-credit-related OTTI recognized in AOCI. 
       
  Interest Rate Payment Terms.   Interest rate payment terms for HTM securities at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are detailed in the following table:  

Certain MBS classified as fixed rate passthrough securities and fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations have an initial fixed interest rate that subsequently converts to an adjustable interest rate on a specified date as follows: 

See   Note 6   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis   for information on the transfers of securities between the AFS portfolio and the HTM portfolio. 

Note 6     Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis    
    
  On a quarterly basis, the Bank evaluates its individual AFS and HTM investment securities in an unrealized loss position for OTTI. As part of this evaluation, the Bank considers whether it intends to sell each debt security and  
  
   19 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis. If either of these conditions is met, the Bank recognizes an OTTI charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the statement of condition date. For securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meet either of these conditions, the Bank considers whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security by comparing its best estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the Bank s best estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, the difference is considered the credit loss. 
    
  PLRMBS.   A significant input to the Bank s cash flow analysis of its PLRMBS is the forecast of future housing price changes. The OTTI Governance Committee of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) developed a short-term housing price forecast with projected changes ranging from a decrease of   1.0%   to an increase of   10.0%   over the 12-month period beginning   July 1, 2016  . For the vast majority of markets, the projected short-term housing price changes range from an increase of   3.0%   to an increase of   6.0%  . Thereafter, a unique path is projected for each geographic area based on an internally developed framework derived from historical data.  
    
  For all the PLRMBS in its AFS and HTM portfolios, the Bank does not intend to sell any security and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell any security before its anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis. 
    
  For securities determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016   (securities for which the Bank determined that it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis), the following table presents a summary of the significant inputs used in measuring the amount of credit loss recognized in earnings during the   third   quarter of   2016  , and the related current credit enhancement for the Bank. 

(1)    Weighted average percentage is based on unpaid principal balance. 
    
  Credit enhancement is defined as the percentage of subordinated tranches, excess spread, and over-collateralization, if any, in a security structure that will generally absorb losses before the Bank will experience a loss on the security. The calculated averages represent the dollar-weighted averages of all the PLRMBS investments in each category shown. The classification is based on the model used to run the estimated cash flows for the CUSIP, which may not necessarily be the same as the classification at the time of origination. 
    
  The following table presents the credit-related OTTI, which is recognized in earnings, for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  
   20 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

(2)    The total accretion or amortization associated with other-than-temporarily impaired PLRMBS (amount recognized in interest income) totaled   $24   and   $20   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The total accretion or amortization associated with other-than-temporarily impaired PLRMBS (amount recognized in interest income) totaled   $76   and   $61   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Changes in circumstances may cause the Bank to change its intent to hold a certain security to maturity without calling into question its intent to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future. The sale or transfer of an HTM security because of certain changes in circumstances, such as evidence of significant deterioration in the issuers  creditworthiness, is not considered to be inconsistent with its original classification. In addition, other events that are isolated, nonrecurring, or unusual for the Bank that could not have been reasonably anticipated may cause the Bank to sell or transfer an HTM security without necessarily calling into question its intent to hold other debt securities to maturity. 
    
  The Bank elected to transfer any PLRMBS that incurred a credit-related OTTI charge during the applicable period from the Bank s held-to-maturity portfolio to its available-for-sale portfolio at their fair values. The Bank recognized an OTTI credit loss on these held-to-maturity PLRMBS, which the Bank believes is evidence of a significant decline in the issuers  creditworthiness. The decline in the issuers  creditworthiness is the basis for the transfers to the available-for-sale portfolio. These transfers allow the Bank the option to sell these securities prior to maturity in view of changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment risk, or other factors, while recognizing the Bank s intent to hold these securities for an indefinite period of time. The Bank does not intend to sell its other-than-temporarily impaired securities and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell any security before its anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis. 
    
  The Bank did not transfer any PLRMBS from its HTM portfolio to its AFS portfolio during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The following table summarizes the PLRMBS transferred from the Bank s HTM portfolio to its AFS portfolio during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The amounts shown represent the values when the securities were transferred from the HTM portfolio to the AFS portfolio.

The following tables present the Bank s AFS and HTM PLRMBS that incurred OTTI losses anytime during the life of the securities at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , by loan collateral type: 

For the Bank s PLRMBS that were not other-than-temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank has experienced net unrealized losses primarily because of illiquidity in the PLRMBS market and market expectations of the credit performance of loan collateral underlying these securities, which caused these assets to be valued at discounts to their amortized cost. The Bank does not intend to sell these securities, it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell these securities before its anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis, and the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. As a result, the Bank determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , all of the gross unrealized losses on these PLRMBS are temporary. These securities were included in the securities that the Bank reviewed and analyzed for OTTI as discussed above, and the analyses performed indicated that these securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired.  
    
  All Other Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Investments.   For the Bank s investments in housing finance agency bonds, which were issued by CalHFA, the gross unrealized losses were mainly due to an illiquid market, credit concerns regarding the underlying mortgage collateral, and credit concerns regarding the monoline insurance providers, causing these investments to be valued at a discount to their acquisition cost. The Bank independently modeled cash flows for the underlying collateral, using assumptions for default rates and loss severity that a market participant would deem reasonable, and concluded that the available credit support within the CalHFA structure more than offset the projected underlying collateral losses. The Bank determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , all of the gross unrealized losses on the bonds are temporary because the underlying collateral and credit enhancements were sufficient to protect the Bank from losses. As a result, the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. 
    
  For its agency MBS, the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities because the Bank determined that the strength of the issuers  guarantees through direct obligations or support from the U.S.  
  
   22

  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

government is sufficient to protect the Bank from losses. As a result, the Bank determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , all of the gross unrealized losses on its agency MBS are temporary. 

Note 7     Advances    
    
  The Bank offers a wide range of fixed and adjustable rate advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics, and option features. Fixed rate advances generally have maturities ranging from one day to 30 years. Adjustable rate advances generally have maturities ranging from less than 30 days to 10 years, with the interest rates resetting periodically at a fixed spread to LIBOR or to another specified index. 
    
  Redemption Terms.   The Bank had advances outstanding, excluding overdrawn demand deposit accounts, at interest rates ranging from   0.33%   to   8.57%   at   September 30, 2016  , and   0.25%   to   8.57%   at   December 31, 2015  , as summarized below.  

Many of the Bank s advances are prepayable at the borrower s option. However, when advances are prepaid, the borrower is generally charged a prepayment fee intended to make the Bank financially indifferent to the prepayment. In addition, for certain advances with partial prepayment symmetry, the Bank may charge the borrower a prepayment fee or pay the borrower a prepayment credit depending on certain circumstances, such as movements in interest rates, when the advance is prepaid. The Bank had advances with partial prepayment symmetry outstanding totaling   $3,651   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $3,510   at   December 31, 2015  . Some advances may be repaid on pertinent call dates without prepayment fees (callable advances). The Bank had callable advances outstanding totaling   $15,551   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $15,425   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Bank s advances at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , included   $125   and   $140   of putable advances, respectively. At the Bank s discretion, the Bank may terminate these advances on predetermined exercise dates and offer replacement funding at prevailing market rates, subject to certain conditions. The Bank would typically exercise such termination rights when interest rates increase. 
    
  The following table summarizes advances at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , by the earlier of the year of contractual maturity or next call date for callable advances and by the earlier of the year of contractual maturity or next put date for putable advances.

Credit and Concentration Risk.   The following tables present the concentration in advances to the top   five   borrowers and their affiliates at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The tables also present the interest income from 
  these advances before the impact of interest rate exchange agreements associated with these advances for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

(1) 
    Interest income amounts exclude the interest effect of interest rate exchange agreements with derivative counterparties; as a result, the total interest income amounts will not agree to the Statements of Income. The amount of interest income from advances can vary depending on the amount outstanding, terms to maturity, interest rates, and repricing characteristics. 
              (2) 
    Nonmember institution.  
              (3) 
    Effective August 31, 2015, JPMorgan Bank   Trust Company, National Association (JPMorgan B T), merged with and into JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan Chase). As a result, JPMorgan B T is no longer a member of the Bank. Upon the merger, all of the Bank capital stock  
     
   24 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

held by JPMorgan B T was transferred to JPMorgan Chase, a nonmember of the Bank, and reclassified as mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and all advances to JPMorgan B T were transferred to JPMorgan Chase. 
           (4) 
    Effective August 3, 2015, CIT Bank merged with and into OneWest Bank, which was renamed CIT Bank, N.A. 
       
  The Bank held a security interest in collateral from each of the top   five   advances borrowers and their affiliates sufficient to support their respective advances outstanding, and the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances. 
    
  For information related to the Bank s credit risk on advances and allowance methodology for credit losses, see   Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses  . 
    
  Interest Rate Payment Terms.   Interest rate payment terms for advances at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are detailed below: 

The Bank may use derivatives to adjust the repricing and options characteristics of advances to more closely match the characteristics of the Bank s funding liabilities. In general, whenever a member executes a fixed or variable rate advance with embedded options, the Bank will simultaneously execute an interest rate exchange agreement with terms that offset the terms and embedded options in the advance. The combination of the advance and the interest rate exchange agreement effectively creates a variable rate asset. This type of hedge relationship receives fair value option accounting treatment. In addition, for certain advances for which the Bank has elected the fair value option, the Bank will simultaneously execute an interest rate exchange agreement with terms that economically offset the terms of the advance. However, this type of hedge is treated as an economic hedge because these combinations generally do not meet the requirements for fair value hedge accounting treatment. For more information, see   Note 15   Derivatives and Hedging Activities   and   Note 16   Fair Value  . 
    
  The Bank did not have any advances with embedded features that met the requirements to separate the embedded feature from the host contract and designate the embedded feature as a stand-alone derivative at   September 30, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  . The Bank has generally elected to account for certain advances with embedded features under the fair value option, and these advances are carried at fair value on the Statements of Condition. For more information, see   Note 16   Fair Value  . 
    
  Prepayment Fees, Net.   The Bank charges borrowers prepayment fees or pays borrowers prepayment credits when the principal on certain advances is paid prior to original maturity. The Bank records prepayment fees net of any associated fair value adjustments related to prepaid advances that were hedged. The net amount of prepayment fees is reflected as interest income in the Statements of Income, as follows:

Note 8     Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio    
    
  Under the Mortgage Partnership Finance  (MPF ) Program, the Bank may purchase from members, for its own portfolio, conventional conforming fixed rate mortgage loans under the MPF Original product and mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) under the MPF Government product. In addition, the Bank may facilitate the purchase of conforming fixed rate mortgage loans from members for concurrent sale to Fannie Mae under the MPF Xtra  product; of jumbo mortgage loans for concurrent sale to Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation, a subsidiary of Redwood Trust, Inc., a real estate investment trust, under the MPF Direct product; and of government-insured or government-guaranteed mortgage loans that will be packaged into securities backed by the mortgage loans and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae  
  
   26 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

under the MPF Government MBS product. When members sell mortgage loans under the MPF Xtra, MPF Direct, and MPF Government MBS products, the loans are sold to a third-party investor and are not recorded on the Bank s Statements of Condition. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had approved   16   members as participating financial institutions since renewing its participation in the MPF Program in 2013.  
    
  From May 2002 through October 2006, the Bank purchased conventional conforming fixed rate mortgage loans from its participating financial institutions under the MPF Original and MPF Plus products. Participating members originated or purchased the mortgage loans, credit-enhanced them and sold them to the Bank, and generally retained the servicing of the loans.  
    
  The following table presents information as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , on mortgage loans, all of which are secured by one- to four-unit residential properties and single-unit second homes. 

Medium-term loans have original contractual terms of 15 years or less, and long-term loans have contractual terms of more than 15 years. 
    
  For information related to the Bank s credit risk on mortgage loans and allowance methodology for credit losses, see   Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses  . 

Note 9     Allowance for Credit Losses    
    
  The Bank has established an allowance methodology for each of its portfolio segments: advances, letters of credit, and other extensions of credit, collectively referred to as  credit products,  mortgage loans held for portfolio, term securities purchased under agreements to resell, and term Federal funds sold. For more information on these portfolio segments, see  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 10   Allowance for Credit Losses  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Credit Products.   The Bank manages its credit exposure related to credit products through an integrated approach that generally provides for a credit limit to be established for each borrower, includes an ongoing review of each borrower s financial condition, and is coupled with conservative collateral and lending policies to limit the risk of loss while taking into account borrowers  needs for a reliable funding source. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , none of the Bank s credit products were past due, on nonaccrual status, or considered impaired. There were no troubled debt restructurings related to credit products during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , or during   2015  . 
    
  Based on the collateral pledged as security for advances, the Bank s credit analyses of borrowers  financial condition, and the Bank s credit extension and collateral policies as of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms. Therefore, no allowance for losses on credit products was deemed necessary by the Bank. The Bank has never experienced any credit losses on its credit products.

  Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.   The following table presents information on delinquent mortgage loans as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 

(1) 
    The recorded investment in a loan is the unpaid principal balance of the loan, adjusted for accrued interest, net deferred loan fees or costs, unamortized premiums or discounts, and direct write-downs. The recorded investment is not net of any valuation allowance. 
              (2) 
    Includes loans for which the servicer has reported a decision to foreclose or to pursue a similar alternative, such as deed-in-lieu. Loans in process of foreclosure are included in past due or current loans depending on their delinquency status.

The recorded investment, unpaid principal balance, and related allowance of impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment are as follows: 

The average recorded investment on impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment is as follows: 

The Bank and any participating financial institution share in the credit risk of the loans sold by that institution as specified in a master agreement. Loans purchased under the MPF Program generally have a credit risk exposure at the time of purchase equivalent to assets rated AA, taking into consideration the credit risk sharing structure mandated by the Finance Agency s acquired member assets (AMA) regulation. The MPF Program structures potential credit losses on conventional MPF loans into layers with respect to each pool of loans purchased by the Bank under a single master commitment, as follows: 
    
           1. 
    The first layer of protection against loss is the liquidation value of the real property securing the loan. 
              2. 
    The next layer of protection comes from the primary mortgage insurance that is required for loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than   80%  , if still in place. 
              3. 
    Losses that exceed the liquidation value of the real property and any primary mortgage insurance, up to an agreed-upon amount called the first loss account for each master commitment, are incurred by the Bank. 
              4. 
    Losses in excess of the first loss account for each master commitment, up to an agreed-upon amount called the credit enhancement amount, are covered by the participating financial institution s credit enhancement obligation at the time losses are incurred. 
              5. 
    Losses in excess of the first loss account and the participating financial institution s remaining credit enhancement for the master commitment, if any, are incurred by the Bank. 
       
  The Bank calculates its estimated allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans acquired under the MPF Original and MPF Plus products as described below. Effective January 1, 2015, the Bank implemented the accounting requirements of regulatory Advisory Bulletin 2012-02. As a result, for any mortgage loans that are more than 180 days past due and that have any outstanding balance in excess of the fair value of the property, less cost to sell, this excess is charged off as a loss by the end of the month in which the applicable time period elapses. Likewise, when a borrower is in bankruptcy, loans are written down to the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, in general within 60 days of receipt of the notification of filing from the bankruptcy court, unless it can be clearly demonstrated and documented that repayment is likely to occur. As a result of these charge-offs, corresponding Allowance for Credit Losses on MPF Loans, which had previously provided for most of these expected losses, was reduced accordingly. 
    
  Allowance for Credit Losses on MPF Loans         The Bank evaluates the allowance for credit losses on MPF mortgage loans based on two components. The first component applies to each individual loan that is specifically identified as impaired. The Bank evaluates the exposure on these loans by considering the first layer of loss protection (the liquidation value of the real property securing the loan) and the availability and collectability of credit  
  
   29 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

enhancements under the terms of each master commitment and records a provision for credit losses. For this component, the Bank established   a de minimis   allowance for credit losses for MPF Original loans as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . For MPF Plus loans, the Bank established an allowance for credit losses totaling   de minimis amounts   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The second component applies to loans that are not specifically identified as impaired and is based on the Bank s estimate of probable credit losses on those loans as of the financial statement date. The Bank evaluates the credit loss exposure on a loan pool basis considering various observable data, such as delinquency statistics, past performance, current performance, loan portfolio characteristics, collateral valuations, industry data, and prevailing economic conditions. The Bank also considers the availability and collectability of credit enhancements from participating financial institutions or from mortgage insurers under the terms of each master commitment. For this component, the Bank established an allowance for credit losses for MPF Original loans totaling   de minimis amounts   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , and for MPF Plus loans totaling   de minimis amounts   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Troubled Debt Restructurings         Troubled debt restructuring (TDR) is considered to have occurred when a concession is granted to the debtor for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties and that concession would not have been considered otherwise. An MPF loan considered a TDR is individually evaluated for impairment when determining its related allowance for credit losses. Credit loss is measured by factoring in expected cash flow shortfalls incurred as of the reporting date as well as the economic loss attributable to delaying the original contractual principal and interest due dates, if applicable. 
    
  The Bank s TDRs of MPF loans primarily involve modifying the borrower s monthly payment for a period of up to 36 months to reflect a housing expense ratio that is no more than   31%   of the borrower s qualifying monthly income. The outstanding principal balance is re-amortized to reflect a principal and interest payment for a term not to exceed 40 years from the original note date and a housing expense ratio not to exceed   31%  . This would result in a balloon payment at the original maturity date of the loan because the maturity date and number of remaining monthly payments are not adjusted. If the   31%   ratio is still not achieved through re-amortization, the interest rate is reduced in   0.125%   increments below the original note rate, to a floor rate of   3.00%  , resulting in reduced principal and interest payments, for the temporary payment modification period of up to 36 months, until the   31%   housing expense ratio is met. The recorded investment of the Bank's nonperforming MPF     loans classified as TDRs totaled   $4   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   $3   as of   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Term Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell.   Securities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans to counterparties that are considered by the Bank to be of investment quality, which are classified as assets in the Statements of Condition. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are held in safekeeping in the name of the Bank by third-party custodians approved by the Bank. In accordance with the terms of these loans, if the market value of the underlying securities decreases below the market value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is charged to earnings. The Bank did not have any term securities purchased under agreements to resell at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Term Federal Funds Sold.   The Bank invests in Federal funds sold with counterparties that are considered by the Bank to be of investment quality, and these investments are evaluated for purposes of an allowance for credit losses only if the investment is not paid when due. The Bank did not have any term Federal funds sold as of   September 30, 2016  . All investments in Federal funds sold as of   December 31, 2015  , were repaid or are expected to be repaid according to the contractual terms. 

Note 10     Deposits    
    
  The Bank maintains demand deposit accounts that are directly related to the extension of credit to members and offers short-term deposit programs to members and qualifying nonmembers. In addition, a member that services mortgage loans may deposit in the Bank funds collected in connection with the mortgage loans, pending disbursement of these funds to the owners of the mortgage loans. The Bank classifies these types of deposits as non-interest-bearing deposits. 
    
  Deposits as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

Interest Rate Payment Terms.   Deposits classified as demand, overnight, and other pay interest based on a daily interest rate. Term deposits pay interest based on a fixed rate determined at the issuance of the deposit. Interest rate payment terms for deposits at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are detailed in the following table: 

Note 11     Consolidated Obligations    
    
  Consolidated obligations, consisting of consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes, are jointly issued by the FHLBanks through the Office of Finance, which serves as the FHLBanks  agent. As provided by the FHLBank Act or by regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks, all FHLBanks have joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations. For a discussion of the joint and several liability regulation, see  Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data   Note 20   Commitments and Contingencies  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. In connection with each issuance of consolidated obligations, each FHLBank specifies the type, term, and amount of debt it requests to have issued on its behalf. The Office of Finance tracks the amount of debt issued on behalf of each FHLBank. In addition, the Bank separately tracks and records as a liability its specific portion of the consolidated obligations issued and is the primary obligor for that portion of the consolidated obligations issued. The Finance Agency and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury have oversight over the issuance of FHLBank debt through the Office of Finance. 
    
  Redemption Terms.   The following is a summary of the Bank s participation in consolidated obligation bonds at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .

The Bank s participation in consolidated obligation bonds outstanding includes callable bonds of   $4,450   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $8,005   at   December 31, 2015  . When a callable bond for which the Bank is the primary obligor is issued, the Bank may simultaneously enter into an interest rate swap (in which the Bank pays a variable rate and receives a fixed rate) with a call feature that mirrors the call option embedded in the bond (a sold callable swap). The Bank had notional amounts of interest rate exchange agreements hedging callable bonds of   $1,595   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $4,835   at   December 31, 2015  . The combined sold callable swaps and callable bonds enable the Bank to meet its funding needs at costs not otherwise directly attainable solely through the issuance of non-callable debt, while effectively converting the Bank s net payment to an adjustable rate. 
    
  The Bank s participation in consolidated obligation bonds at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , was as follows:     

The following is a summary of the Bank s participation in consolidated obligation bonds outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , by the earlier of the year of contractual maturity or next call date.  

Consolidated obligation discount notes are consolidated obligations issued to raise short-term funds. These notes are issued at less than their face value and redeemed at par value when they mature. The Bank s participation in consolidated obligation discount notes, all of which are due within one year, was as follows:

  Interest Rate Payment Terms.   Interest rate payment terms for consolidated obligations at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are detailed in the following table. For information on the general terms and types of 
  consolidated obligations outstanding, see  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 12   
  Consolidated Obligations  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 

The Bank did not have any bonds with embedded features that met the requirements to separate the embedded feature from the host contract and designate the embedded feature as a stand-alone derivative at   September 30, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  . The Bank has generally elected to account for certain bonds with embedded features under the fair value option, and these bonds are carried at fair value on the Statements of Condition. For more information, see   Note 16   Fair Value  .

Note 13     Capital    
    
  Capital Requirements.   Under the Housing Act, the Director of the Finance Agency is responsible for setting the risk-based capital standards for the FHLBanks. The FHLBank Act and regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks require that the Bank s minimum capital stock requirement for shareholders must be sufficient to enable the Bank to meet its regulatory requirements for total capital, leverage capital, and risk-based capital. The Bank must maintain: (i) total regulatory capital in an amount equal to at least   4%   of its total assets, (ii) leverage capital in an amount equal to at least   5%   of its total assets, and (iii) permanent capital in an amount that is greater than or equal to its risk-based capital requirement. Because the Bank issues only Class B stock, regulatory capital and permanent capital for the Bank are both composed of retained earnings and Class B stock, including mandatorily redeemable capital stock (which is classified as a liability for financial reporting purposes). Regulatory capital and permanent capital do not include AOCI. Leverage capital is defined as the sum of permanent capital, weighted by a   1.5   multiplier, plus non-permanent capital.   
    
  The risk-based capital requirement is equal to the sum of the Bank s credit risk, market risk, and operations risk capital requirements, all of which are calculated in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Finance Agency. The Finance Agency may require an FHLBank to maintain a greater amount of permanent capital than is required by the risk-based capital requirement as defined.

As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank was in compliance with these capital rules and requirements as shown in the following table.    

Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock.   The Bank had mandatorily redeemable capital stock totaling   $484   outstanding to   eight   institutions at   September 30, 2016  , and   $488   outstanding to   nine   institutions at   December 31, 2015  . The change in mandatorily redeemable capital stock for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was as follows: 

(1) 
    The Bank reclassified   $403   of capital stock to mandatorily redeemable capital stock (a liability) on September 1, 2015, as a result of the merger of JPMorgan B T with and into JPMorgan Chase, a nonmember of the Bank.  
       
  Cash dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock were recorded as interest expense in the amount of   $11   and   $33   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and in the amount of   $7   and   $60   for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  The Bank s mandatorily redeemable capital stock is discussed more fully in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 15   Capital  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  The following table presents mandatorily redeemable capital stock amounts by contractual redemption period at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .

  Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework summarizes the Bank s capital management principles 
  and objectives, as well as its policies and practices, with respect to retained earnings, dividend payments, and the 
  repurchase of excess capital stock. The Bank may be restricted from paying dividends if the Bank is not in

compliance with any of its minimum capital requirements or if payment would cause the Bank to fail to meet any of 
  its minimum capital requirements. In addition, the Bank may not pay dividends if any principal or interest due on 
  any consolidated obligations has not been paid in full or is not expected to be paid in full, or, under certain 
  circumstances, if the Bank fails to satisfy certain liquidity requirements under applicable Finance Agency 
  regulations. 
    
  The Bank s Risk Management Policy limits the payment of dividends if the ratio of the Bank s estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock falls below certain levels. If this ratio at the end of any quarter is less than   100%   but greater than or equal to   70%  , any dividend would be limited to an annualized rate no greater than the daily average of the three-month LIBOR for the applicable quarter (subject to certain conditions), and if this ratio is less than   70%  , the Bank would be restricted from paying a dividend. The ratio of the Bank s estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock was   214%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In addition, the Bank monitors the condition of its PLRMBS portfolio, the ratio of the Bank s estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock, its overall financial performance and retained earnings, developments in the mortgage and credit markets, and other relevant information as the basis for determining the payment of dividends and the repurchase of excess capital stock each quarter. 
    
  Retained Earnings     The Bank s Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework establishes amounts to be retained in restricted retained earnings, which are not made available in the current dividend period. 
    
  The following table summarizes the activity related to retained earnings for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

For more information on these three categories of restricted retained earnings and the Bank s Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework, see  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 15   Capital  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Dividend Payments     Finance Agency rules state that FHLBanks may declare and pay dividends only from previously retained earnings or current net earnings, and may not declare or pay dividends based on projected or anticipated earnings. There is no requirement that the Board of Directors declare and pay any dividend. A decision by the Board of Directors to declare or not declare a dividend is a discretionary matter and is subject to the requirements and restrictions of the FHLBank Act and applicable requirements under the regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks.  
    
  In addition, Finance Agency rules do not permit the Bank to pay dividends in the form of capital stock if its excess 
  capital stock exceeds   1%   of its total assets. Excess capital stock is defined as the aggregate of the capital stock held by each shareholder in excess of its minimum capital stock requirement, as established by the Bank s capital plan. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s excess capital stock totaled   $383  , or   0.40%   of total assets. 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of   9.17%  , totaling   $63  , including   $52    
  in dividends on capital stock and   $11   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. In the   third   quarter of   2015  , the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of   10.01%  , totaling   $79  , including   $72   in dividends on capital stock and   $7   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of   8.70%  , totaling   $179  , including   $146   in dividends on capital stock and   $33   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. In the first   nine   months of   2015  , the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of   13.30%  , totaling   $373  , of which   $145   was related to the special dividend paid in the second quarter of 2015. The total dividends paid included   $313   in dividends on capital stock and   $60   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
    
  For the periods referenced above, the Bank paid dividends in cash. Dividends on capital stock are recognized as dividends on the Statements of Capital Accounts, and dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock are recognized as interest expense on the Statements of Income. 
    
  On October 19, 2016, the Bank s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of   $100   on the capital stock outstanding during the third quarter of 2016, including   $83   in dividends on capital stock and   $17   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The Bank recorded the special dividend on October 19, 2016. On   October 27, 2016  , the Bank s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the capital stock outstanding during the   third   quarter of   2016   at an annualized rate of   8.94%  , totaling   $66  , including   $55   in dividends on capital stock and  
  
   37 

Table of Contents

  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

$11   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The Bank recorded the quarterly dividend on   October 27, 2016  . The Bank expects to pay both the special dividend and the quarterly dividend on   November 14, 2016  . Dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock will be recognized as interest expense in the   fourth   quarter of   2016  .  
    
  Excess Capital Stock     The Bank may repurchase some or all of a shareholder s excess capital stock, including any excess mandatorily redeemable capital stock, at the Bank s discretion, subject to certain statutory and regulatory requirements. The Bank must give the shareholder 15 days  written notice; however, the shareholder may waive this notice period. The Bank may also repurchase all of a member s excess capital stock at a member s request, at the Bank s discretion, subject to certain statutory and regulatory requirements. A shareholder s excess capital stock is defined as any capital stock holdings in excess of the shareholder s minimum capital stock requirement, as established by the Bank s capital plan.  
    
  On a quarterly basis, the Bank determines whether it will repurchase excess capital stock. The Bank repurchased   $252  ,   $136   and   $275   in excess capital stock in the first, second and   third   quarters of   2016  , respectively, and   $750  ,   $847   and   $296   in excess capital stock in the first, second and   third   quarters of   2015  , respectively.  
    
  The Bank is required to redeem any mandatorily redeemable capital stock that is in excess of a former member s minimum stock requirement on or after the expiration of the five-year redemption date. During the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , the Bank redeemed   $1   amount and   $18  , respectively, in mandatorily redeemable capital stock, for which the five-year redemption period had expired, at its   $100   par value. The stock was redeemed on the scheduled redemption dates or, for stock that was not excess stock on its scheduled redemption date because of outstanding activity with the Bank, on the first available repurchase date after the stock was no longer required to support outstanding activity with the Bank. 
    
  On May 29, 2015, the Bank s Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework was revised to reinstate the Bank s practice of repurchasing the surplus capital stock of all members and the excess capital stock of all nonmember shareholders on a regular quarterly basis, at the Bank s discretion and subject to certain statutory and regulatory requirements and to the Bank s Risk Management Policy and capital plan limitations. Surplus capital stock is defined as any stock holdings in excess of 115% of a member s minimum stock requirement. In addition, at the Bank s discretion, all of the excess stock held by a member may be repurchased upon request of a member, subject to the requirements and limitations mentioned above. In accordance with the revised Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework, each quarter Bank management evaluates and determines the amount of capital stock to be repurchased in that quarter, if any, giving consideration to certain capital metrics and capital management objectives and strategies, and subject to the requirements and limitations mentioned above. At least 15 calendar days before any repurchase, the Bank will notify shareholders of its intention to repurchase capital stock and of the scheduled repurchase date. On the scheduled repurchase date, the Bank will calculate the amount of stock to be repurchased to ensure that each member and nonmember shareholder will continue to meet its minimum stock requirement after the repurchase. 
    
  On   October 28, 2016  , the Bank announced that it plans to repurchase the surplus capital stock of all members and the excess capital stock of all nonmember shareholders on   November 15, 2016  .  
    
  Excess capital stock totaled   $383   as of   September 30, 2016  , which included surplus capital stock of   $231  . Excess capital stock totaled   $402   as of   December 31, 2015  , which included surplus capital stock of   $260  .  
    
  For more information on excess capital stock, see  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 15   Capital  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Concentration.   JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, a nonmember institution, held   $400  , or   14%  , of the Bank s outstanding capital stock, including mandatorily redeemable capital stock, as of   September 30, 2016  , and

$400  , or   15%   as of   December 31, 2015  . No other institution held more than   10%   of the Bank s outstanding capital stock as of   September 30, 2016  , or   December 31, 2015  . 

Note 14     Segment Information    
    
  The Bank uses an analysis of financial performance based on the balances and adjusted net interest income of two operating segments, the advances-related business and the mortgage-related business, as well as other financial information, to review and assess financial performance and to determine the allocation of resources to these   two   major business segments. For purposes of segment reporting, adjusted net interest income includes income and expense associated with net settlements from economic hedges that are recorded in  Net gain/(loss) on derivatives and hedging activities  in other income and excludes interest expense that is recorded in  Mandatorily redeemable capital stock.  Other key financial information, such as any credit-related OTTI losses on the Bank s PLRMBS, other expenses, and assessments, is not included in the segment reporting analysis, but is incorporated into the Bank s overall assessment of financial performance. 
    
  For more information on these operating segments, see  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 17   Segment Information  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  The following table presents the Bank s adjusted net interest income by operating segment and reconciles total adjusted net interest income to income before the AHP assessment for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

(2) 
    Represents amortization of amounts deferred for adjusted net interest income purposes only, in accordance with the Bank s   Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework  . 
              (3) 
    The Bank includes income and expense associated with net settlements from economic hedges in adjusted net interest income in its analysis of financial performance for its   two   operating segments. For financial reporting purposes, the Bank does not include these amounts in net interest income in the Statements of Income, but instead records them in other income in    Net gain/(loss)   on derivatives and hedging activities.

Note 15     Derivatives and Hedging Activities    
    
  General  .   The Bank may enter into interest rate swaps (including callable, putable, and basis swaps); and cap and floor agreements (collectively, interest rate exchange agreements or derivatives). Most of the Bank s interest rate exchange agreements are executed in conjunction with the origination of advances or the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds to create variable rate structures. The interest rate exchange agreements are generally executed at the same time the advances and bonds are transacted and generally have the same maturity dates as the related advances and bonds. The Bank transacts most of its derivatives with large banks and major broker-dealers. Some of these banks and broker-dealers or their affiliates buy, sell, and distribute consolidated obligations. Over-the-counter derivatives may be either uncleared or cleared. In an uncleared derivative transaction, the Bank s counterparty is the executing bank or broker-dealer. In a cleared derivative transaction, the Bank may execute the transaction either directly with the executing bank or broker-dealer or on a swap execution facility, but in either case, the Bank s counterparty is a derivatives clearing organization or clearinghouse once the derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing. The Bank is not a derivative dealer and does not trade derivatives for short-term profit. 
    
  Additional uses of interest rate exchange agreements include: (i) offsetting embedded features in assets and liabilities, (ii) hedging anticipated issuance of debt, (iii) matching against consolidated obligation discount notes or bonds to create the equivalent of callable or non-callable fixed rate debt, (iv) modifying the repricing frequency of assets and liabilities, (v) matching against certain advances and consolidated obligations for which the Bank elected the fair value option, and (vi) exactly offsetting other derivatives that may be executed with members (with the Bank serving as an intermediary) or cleared at a derivatives clearing organization. The Bank s use of interest rate exchange agreements results in one of the following classifications: (i) a fair value hedge of an underlying financial instrument, (ii) an economic hedge of assets or liabilities, or (iii) an intermediary transaction for members. 
    
  Interest Rate Swaps     An interest rate swap is an agreement between two entities to exchange cash flows in the future. The agreement sets the dates on which the cash flows will be paid and the manner in which the cash flows will be calculated. One of the simplest forms of an interest rate swap involves the promise by one party to pay cash flows equivalent to the interest on a notional principal amount at a predetermined fixed rate for a given period of time. In return for this promise, the party receives cash flows equivalent to the interest on the same notional principal amount at a variable rate for the same period of time. The variable rate received or paid by the Bank in most interest rate exchange agreements is indexed to LIBOR. 
    
  Interest Rate Caps and Floors     In a cap agreement, additional cash flow is generated if the price or interest rate of an underlying variable rate rises above a certain threshold (or cap) price. In a floor agreement, additional cash flow is generated if the price or interest rate of an underlying variable rate falls below a certain threshold (or floor) price. Caps and floors may be used in conjunction with assets or liabilities. In general, caps and floors are designed as protection against the interest rate on a variable rate asset or liability rising above or falling below a certain level. 
    
  Hedging Activities.   The Bank documents all relationships between derivative hedging instruments and hedged items, its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions, and its method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Derivatives designated as fair value hedges are transacted to hedge: (i) assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, (ii) firm commitments, or (iii) forecasted transactions. The Bank also formally assesses (both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the hedging derivatives have been effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain effective hedges in future periods. The Bank typically uses regression analyses or other statistical analyses to assess the effectiveness of its hedges. When it is determined that a derivative has not been or is not expected to be effective as a hedge, the Bank discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. 
    
  The Bank discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (i) it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (ii) the derivative and/or the hedged item expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period; (iv) a hedged firm  
  
   40

  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment; (v) it determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate; or (vi) it decides to use the derivative to offset changes in the fair value of other derivatives or instruments carried at fair value. 
    
  Intermediation and Offsetting Derivatives         As an additional service to its members, the Bank has in the past entered into offsetting interest rate exchange agreements, acting as an intermediary between offsetting derivative transactions with members and other counterparties. This intermediation allows members indirect access to the derivatives market. The Bank also enters into derivatives to offset the economic effect of other derivatives that are no longer designated to advances, investments, or consolidated obligations. Neither type of offsetting derivatives receives hedge accounting treatment and both are separately marked to market through earnings. The net result of the accounting for these derivatives does not significantly affect the operating results of the Bank.    
    
  The notional principal of the interest rate exchange agreements associated with derivatives with members or offsetting derivatives with other counterparties was $  14   and $  132  , at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Investments           The Bank may invest in U.S. Treasury and agency obligations, agency MBS, and the taxable portion of highly rated state or local housing finance agency obligations. In the past, the Bank has also invested in PLRMBS rated AAA at the time of acquisition. The interest rate and prepayment risk associated with these investment securities is managed through a combination of debt issuance and derivatives. The Bank may manage prepayment risk and interest rate risk by funding investment securities with consolidated obligations that have call features or by hedging the prepayment risk with a combination of consolidated obligations and callable swaps. The Bank may execute callable swaps in conjunction with the issuance of certain liabilities to create funding that is economically equivalent to fixed rate callable debt. Although these derivatives are economic hedges against prepayment risk and are designated to individual liabilities, they do not receive either fair value or cash flow hedge accounting treatment. Investment securities may be classified as trading, AFS, or HTM. 
    
  The Bank may also manage the risk arising from changing market prices or cash flows of investment securities classified as trading by entering into interest rate exchange agreements (economic hedges) that offset the changes in fair value or cash flows of the securities. The market value changes of both the trading securities and the associated interest rate exchange agreements are included in other income in the Statements of Income. 
    
  Advances         The Bank offers a wide array of advances structures to meet members  funding needs. These advances may have maturities up to 30 years with fixed or adjustable rates and may include early termination features or options. The Bank may use derivatives to adjust the repricing and options characteristics of advances to more closely match the characteristics of the Bank s funding liabilities. In general, whenever a member executes a fixed or variable rate advance with embedded options, the Bank will simultaneously execute an interest rate exchange agreement with terms that offset the terms and embedded options in the advance. The combination of the advance and the interest rate exchange agreement effectively creates a variable rate asset. 
    
  In addition, for certain advances for which the Bank has elected the fair value option, the Bank will simultaneously execute an interest rate exchange agreement with terms that economically offset the terms of the advance. 
    
  Mortgage Loans           The Bank s investment portfolio includes fixed rate mortgage loans. The prepayment options embedded in mortgage loans can result in extensions or contractions in the expected repayment of these investments, depending on changes in estimated prepayment speeds. The Bank manages the interest rate risk and prepayment risk associated with fixed rate mortgage loans through a combination of debt issuance and derivatives. The Bank uses both callable and non-callable debt to achieve cash flow patterns and market value sensitivities for liabilities similar to those expected on the mortgage loans. Net income could be reduced if the Bank replaces prepaid mortgages with lower-yielding assets and the Bank s higher funding costs are not reduced accordingly. 

41

  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

The Bank executes callable swaps in conjunction with the issuance of certain consolidated obligations to create funding that is economically equivalent to fixed rate callable bonds. Although these derivatives are economic hedges against the prepayment risk of specific loan pools and are referenced to individual liabilities, they do not receive either fair value or cash flow hedge accounting treatment.  
    
  Consolidated Obligations     Consolidated obligation bonds may be structured to meet the Bank s or the investors  needs. Common structures include fixed rate bonds with or without call options and adjustable rate bonds with or without embedded options. In general, when bonds are issued, the Bank simultaneously executes an interest rate exchange agreement with terms that offset the terms and embedded options, if any, of the consolidated obligation bond. This combination of the consolidated obligation bond and the interest rate exchange agreement effectively creates an adjustable rate bond. The cost of this funding combination is generally lower than the cost that would be available through the issuance of an adjustable rate bond alone. These transactions generally receive fair value hedge accounting treatment.  
    
  In addition, when certain consolidated obligation bonds for which the Bank has elected the fair value option are issued, the Bank simultaneously executes an interest rate exchange agreement with terms that economically offset the terms of the consolidated obligation bond. However, this type of hedge is treated as an economic hedge because these combinations do not meet the requirements for fair value hedge accounting treatment. 
    
  Credit Risk     The Bank is subject to credit risk as a result of the risk of potential nonperformance by counterparties to the derivative agreements. All of the Bank s agreements governing uncleared derivative transactions contain master netting provisions to help mitigate the credit risk exposure to each counterparty. The Bank manages counterparty credit risk through credit analyses and collateral requirements and by following the requirements of the Bank s risk management policies and credit guidelines and Finance Agency regulations. The Bank also requires credit support agreements with collateral delivery thresholds on all uncleared derivatives. Currently, all of the Bank s active uncleared derivative counterparties have a zero threshold. In addition, collateral related to derivative transactions with member institutions includes collateral pledged to the Bank, as evidenced by the Advances and Security Agreement, which may be held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank. 
    
  For cleared derivatives, the clearinghouse is the Bank s counterparty. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives, however, mitigates the Bank s overall credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and variation margin is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank has analyzed the enforceability of offsetting rights applicable to its cleared derivative transactions and determined that the exercise of those offsetting rights by a non-defaulting party under these transactions should be upheld under applicable bankruptcy law and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules in the event of a clearinghouse or clearing agent insolvency and under applicable clearinghouse rules upon a non-insolvency-based event of default of the clearinghouse or clearing agent. Based on this analysis, the Bank presents a net derivative receivable or payable for all of its transactions through a particular clearing agent with a particular clearinghouse. 
    
  Based on the Bank s credit analyses and the collateral requirements, the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on its derivative transactions. 
    
  The notional amount of an interest rate exchange agreement serves as a factor in determining periodic interest payments or cash flows received and paid. However, the notional amount of derivatives represents neither the actual amounts exchanged nor the overall exposure of the Bank to credit risk and market risk. The risks of derivatives can be measured meaningfully on a portfolio basis by taking into account the counterparties, the types of derivatives, the items being hedged, and any offsets between the derivatives and the items being hedged.  
    
  The Bank s agreements for uncleared derivative transactions contain provisions that link the Bank s credit rating from Moody s Investors Service and S P Global Ratings to various rights and obligations. Certain of these  
  
   42 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

derivative agreements provide that, if the Bank s long-term debt rating falls below a specified rating (ranging from A3/A- to Baa3/BBB-), the Bank s counterparty would have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate all of its outstanding derivative transactions with the Bank; the Bank s agreements with its clearing agents for cleared derivative transactions have similar provisions with respect to the debt rating of FHLBank System consolidated bonds. If this occurs, the Bank may choose to enter into replacement hedges, either by transferring the existing transactions to another counterparty or entering into new replacement transactions, based on prevailing market rates. In addition, under some of its credit support agreements for uncleared derivative transactions, the amount of collateral that the Bank is required to deliver to a counterparty depends on the Bank s credit rating.   The aggregate fair value of all uncleared derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net derivative liability position (before cash collateral and related accrued interest) at   September 30, 2016  , was   $39  , for which the Bank had posted collateral with a fair value of   $36   in the ordinary course of business. If the Bank s credit rating at   September 30, 2016  , had been lowered from its current rating to the next lower rating, that would have triggered additional collateral to be delivered, and the Bank would have been required to deliver a de minimis amount of additional collateral (at fair value) to its derivative counterparties at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments including the effect of netting adjustments and cash collateral as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . For purposes of this disclosure, the derivative values include the fair value of derivatives and related accrued interest.  

(1) 
    Amounts include the netting of derivative assets and liabilities by counterparty, including cash collateral and related accrued interest, where the netting requirements have been met. Cash collateral posted and related accrued interest was   $85   and   $57   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.   Cash collateral received and related accrued interest was   $28   and   $132   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Note 16     Fair Value    
    
  The following fair value amounts have been determined by the Bank using available market information and the Bank s best judgment of appropriate valuation methods. These estimates are based on pertinent information available to the Bank at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . Although the Bank uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique or valuation methodology. For example, because an active secondary market does not exist for a portion of the Bank s financial instruments, in certain cases fair values cannot be precisely quantified or verified and may change as economic and market factors and evaluation of those factors change. The Bank continues to refine its valuation methodologies as markets and products develop and the pricing for certain products becomes more or less transparent. While the Bank believes that its valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value as of the reporting date. Therefore, the fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in current market transactions, although they do reflect the Bank s judgment as to how a market participant would estimate the fair values. The fair value summary table does not represent an estimate of the overall market value of the Bank as a going concern, which would take into account future business opportunities and the net profitability of total assets and liabilities.  
    
  The following tables present the carrying value, the estimated fair value, and the fair value hierarchy level of the Bank s financial instruments at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .

  Fair Value Hierarchy.   The fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the fair value methodologies and valuation techniques as well as the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value for assets and liabilities carried at fair value on the Statements of Condition. The inputs are evaluated and an overall level for the fair value measurement is determined. This overall level is an indication of market observability of the fair value measurement for the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). An entity must disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the measurements are classified for all financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring or non-recurring basis. 
    
  The application of the fair value hierarchy to the Bank s financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value either on a recurring or non-recurring basis is as follows: 
             
    Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the reporting entity can access on the measurement date. 
                
    Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: (1) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar  
     
   47 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, and implied volatilities); and (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.  
             
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
       
  A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
    
  The following assets and liabilities, including those for which the Bank has elected the fair value option, are carried at fair value on the Statements of Condition as of   September 30, 2016  :  
             
    Trading securities 
                
    AFS securities 
                
    Certain advances  
                
    Derivative assets and liabilities 
                
    Certain consolidated obligation bonds 
                
    Certain other assets 
       
  For instruments carried at fair value, the Bank reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of the valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of certain assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are reported as transfers in or out as of the beginning of the quarter in which the changes occur. For the periods presented, the Bank did not have any reclassifications for transfers in or out of the fair value hierarchy levels. 
    
  Summary of Valuation Methodologies and Primary Inputs.    
    
  Cash and Due from Banks           The estimated fair value equals the carrying value. 
    
  Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell     The estimated fair value of overnight Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell approximates the carrying value. The estimated fair value of term Federal funds sold and term securities purchased under agreements to resell has been determined by calculating the present value of expected cash flows for the instruments and reducing the amount for accrued interest receivable. The discount rates used in these calculations are the replacement rates for comparable instruments with similar terms.  
    
  Interest-Bearing Deposits         The fair value of deposits is generally equal to the carrying value of the deposits because the deposits are primarily overnight deposits or due on demand. The Bank determines the fair values of term deposits by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows from the deposits and reducing the amount for accrued interest receivable. The discount rates used in these calculations are the cost of deposits with similar terms. 
    
  Investment Securities       MBS     To value its MBS, the Bank obtains prices from   four   designated third-party pricing vendors when available. The pricing vendors use various proprietary models to price these securities. The inputs to those models are derived from various sources including, but not limited to: benchmark yields, reported trades, dealer estimates, issuer spreads, prices on benchmark securities, bids, offers, and other market-related data. Since many securities do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing vendors use available information as applicable, such as benchmark yield curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing, to determine the prices for individual securities. Each pricing vendor has an established challenge process in place for all security valuations, which facilitates resolution of price discrepancies identified by the Bank. 
    
  At least annually, the Bank conducts reviews of the   four   pricing vendors to update and confirm its understanding of the vendors  pricing processes, methodologies, and control procedures. 
  
   48

  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

The Bank s valuation technique for estimating the fair values of its MBS first requires the establishment of a median vendor price for each security. If   four   vendor prices are received, the average of the middle   two   prices is the median price; if   three   prices are received, the middle price is the median price; if   two   prices are received, the average of the   two   prices is the median price; and if   one   price is received, it is the median price (and also the default fair value) subject to additional validation. All vendor prices that are within a specified tolerance threshold of the median price are included in the cluster of vendor prices that are averaged to establish a default fair value. All vendor prices that are outside the threshold (outliers) are subject to further analysis including, but not limited to, comparison to prices provided by an additional third-party valuation service, prices for similar securities and/or dealer estimates, or use of internal model prices, which are deemed to be reflective of all relevant facts and circumstances that a market participant would consider. Such analysis is also applied in those limited instances where no third-party vendor price or only one third-party vendor price is available in order to arrive at an estimated fair value. If an outlier (or some other price identified in the analysis) is determined to be a better estimate of fair value, then the outlier (or the other price, as appropriate) is used as the fair value rather than the default fair value. If, instead, the analysis confirms that an outlier is (or outliers are) not representative of fair value and the default fair value is the best estimate, then the default fair value is used as the fair value. 
    
  If all vendor prices received for a security are outside the tolerance threshold level of the median price, then there is no default fair value, and the fair value is determined by an evaluation of all outlier prices (or the other prices, as appropriate) as described above. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   four   vendor prices were received for most of the Bank s MBS, and the fair value estimates for most of those securities were determined by averaging the   four   vendor prices. Based on the Bank s reviews of the pricing methods employed by the third-party pricing vendors and the relative lack of dispersion among the vendor prices (or, in those instances in which there were outliers or significant yield variances, the Bank s additional analyses), the Bank believes that its fair value estimates are reasonable and that the fair value measurements are classified appropriately in the fair value hierarchy. Based on limited market liquidity for PLRMBS, the fair value measurements for these securities were classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Investment Securities       FFCB Bonds and CalHFA Bonds         The Bank estimates the fair values of these securities using the methodology described above for   Investment Securities   MBS  . 
    
  Advances         Because quoted prices are not available for advances, the fair values are measured using model-based valuation techniques (such as calculating the present value of future cash flows and reducing the amount for accrued interest receivable).  
    
  The Bank s primary inputs for measuring the fair value of advances are market-based consolidated obligation yield curve (CO Curve) inputs obtained from the Office of Finance. The CO Curve is then adjusted to reflect the rates on replacement advances with similar terms and collateral. These spread adjustments are not market-observable and are evaluated for significance in the overall fair value measurement and the fair value hierarchy level of the advance. The Bank obtains market-observable inputs for complex advances. These inputs may include volatility assumptions, which are market-based expectations of future interest rate volatility implied from current market prices for similar options (swaption volatility and volatility skew). The discount rates used in these calculations are the replacement advance rates for advances with similar terms. Pursuant to the Finance Agency s advances regulation, advances with an original term to maturity or repricing period greater than six months generally require a prepayment fee sufficient to make the Bank financially indifferent to the borrower s decision to prepay the advances. The Bank determined that no adjustment is required to the fair value measurement of advances for prepayment fees. In addition, the Bank did not adjust its fair value measurement of advances for creditworthiness primarily because advances were fully collateralized. 
    
  Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio     The estimated fair value for seasoned mortgage loans represents modeled prices based on observable market prices for seasoned agency mortgage-backed passthrough securities adjusted for  
  
   49 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

differences in coupon, average loan rate, credit, and cash flow remittance between the Bank s mortgage loans and the referenced instruments, while the estimated fair value for newly originated mortgage loans represents modeled prices based on MPF commitment rates. Market prices are highly dependent on the underlying prepayment assumptions. Changes in the prepayment speeds often have a material effect on the fair value estimates. These underlying prepayment assumptions are susceptible to material changes in the near term because they are made at a specific point in time.  
    
  Loans to Other FHLBanks         Because these are overnight transactions, the estimated fair value approximates the recorded carrying value. 
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable     The estimated fair value approximates the carrying value of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable.  
    
  Other Assets     The estimated fair value of grantor trust assets is based on quoted market prices. 
    
  Derivative Assets and Liabilities         In general, derivative instruments transacted and held by the Bank for risk management activities are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. These derivatives are interest rate-related. For these derivatives, the Bank measures fair value using internally developed discounted cash flow models that use market-observable inputs, such as the overnight index swap (OIS) curve and volatility assumptions, which are market-based expectations of future interest rate volatility implied from current market prices for similar options (swaption volatility and volatility skew), adjusted for counterparty credit risk, as necessary. 
    
  The Bank is subject to credit risk because of the risk of potential nonperformance by its derivative counterparties. To mitigate this risk, the Bank executes uncleared derivative transactions only with highly rated derivative dealers and major banks (derivative dealer counterparties) that meet the Bank s eligibility criteria. In addition, the Bank has entered into master netting agreements and bilateral credit support agreements with all active derivative dealer counterparties that provide for delivery of collateral at specified levels to limit the Bank s net unsecured credit exposure to these counterparties. Under these policies and agreements, the amount of unsecured credit exposure to an individual derivative dealer counterparty is either (i) limited to an absolute dollar credit exposure limit according to the counterparty s long-term debt or deposit credit rating, as determined by rating agencies or (ii) set at zero (subject to a minimum transfer amount). The Bank clears its cleared derivative transactions only through clearing agents that meet the Bank s eligibility requirements, and the Bank s credit exposure to the clearinghouse is secured by variation margin received from the clearinghouse. All credit exposure from derivative transactions entered into by the Bank with member counterparties that are not derivative dealers must be fully secured by eligible collateral.   The Bank evaluated the potential for the fair value of the instruments to be affected by counterparty credit risk and determined that no adjustments to the overall fair value measurements were required. 
    
  The fair values of the derivative assets and liabilities include accrued interest receivable/payable and cash collateral remitted to/received from counterparties. The estimated fair values of the accrued interest receivable/payable and cash collateral approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. The fair values of derivatives that met the netting requirements are presented on a net basis. If these netted amounts are positive, they are classified as an asset and, if negative, they are classified as a liability. 
    
  Deposits         The fair value of deposits is generally equal to the carrying value of the deposits because the deposits are primarily overnight deposits or due on demand. The Bank determines the fair values of term deposits by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows from the deposits and reducing the amount for accrued interest payable. The discount rates used in these calculations are the cost of deposits with similar terms. 
    
  Consolidated Obligations         Because quoted prices in active markets are not generally available for identical liabilities, the Bank measures fair values using internally developed models that use primarily market-observable inputs. The Bank s primary input for measuring the fair value of consolidated obligation bonds is a market-based  
  
   50 

Table of Contents  
  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

CO Curve obtained from the Office of Finance. The Office of Finance constructs the CO Curve using the Treasury yield curve as a base curve, which is adjusted by indicative consolidated obligation spreads obtained from market-observable sources. These market indications are generally derived from pricing indications from dealers, historical pricing relationships, and market activity for similar liabilities, such as recent GSE issuances or secondary market activity. For consolidated obligation bonds with embedded options, the Bank also obtains market-observable inputs, such as volatility assumptions, which are market-based expectations of future interest rate volatility implied from current market prices for similar options (swaption volatility and volatility skew). 
    
  Adjustments may be necessary to reflect the Bank s credit quality or the credit quality of the FHLBank System when valuing consolidated obligation bonds measured at fair value. The Bank monitors its own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the other FHLBanks and the FHLBank System to determine whether any adjustments are necessary for creditworthiness in its fair value measurement of consolidated obligation bonds. The credit ratings of the FHLBank System and any changes to the credit ratings are the basis for the Bank to determine whether the fair values of consolidated obligations have been significantly affected during the reporting period by changes in the instrument-specific credit risk. 
    
  Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock         The estimated fair value of capital stock subject to mandatory redemption is generally at par value as indicated by contemporaneous purchases, redemptions, and repurchases at par value. Fair value includes estimated dividends earned at the time of reclassification from capital to liabilities, until such amount is paid, and any subsequently declared capital stock dividend. The Bank s capital stock can only be acquired by members at par value and redeemed or repurchased at par value, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements. The Bank s capital stock is not traded, and no market mechanism exists for the exchange of Bank capital stock outside the cooperative ownership structure. 
    
  Commitments     The estimated fair value of standby letters of credit is based on the present value of fees currently charged for similar agreements and is recorded in other liabilities. The estimated fair value of off-balance sheet fixed rate commitments to fund advances and commitments to issue consolidated obligations takes into account the difference between current and committed interest rates. 
    
  Subjectivity of Estimates Related to Fair Values of Financial Instruments.   Estimates of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the methodologies described above are subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters, such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, prepayment speed assumptions, expected interest rate volatility, methods to determine possible distributions of future interest rates used to value options, and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. Changes in these judgments often have a material effect on the fair value estimates. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements.   The tables below present the fair value of assets and liabilities, which are recorded on a recurring or nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , by level within the fair value hierarchy.

Fair Value Option.   The fair value option provides an entity with an irrevocable option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments not previously carried at fair value. It requires an entity to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the entity has chosen to use fair value on the face of the Statements of Condition. Fair value is used for both the initial and subsequent measurement of the designated assets, liabilities, and commitments, with the changes in fair value recognized in net income. Interest income and interest expense on advances and consolidated bonds carried at fair value are recognized solely on the contractual amount of interest due or unpaid. Any transaction fees or costs are immediately recognized in non-interest income or non-interest expense. 
    
  For more information on the Bank s election of the fair value option, see  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 19   Fair Values  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K.

The Bank has elected the fair value option for certain financial instruments to assist in mitigating potential earnings volatility that can arise from economic hedging relationships in which the carrying value of the hedged item is not adjusted for changes in fair value. The potential earnings volatility associated with using fair value only for the derivative is the Bank s primary reason for electing the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities that do not qualify for hedge accounting or that have not previously met or may be at risk for not meeting the hedge effectiveness requirements. 
    
  The following table summarizes the activity related to financial assets and liabilities for which the Bank elected the fair value option during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

For instruments for which the fair value option has been elected, the related contractual interest income and contractual interest expense are recorded as part of net interest income on the Statements of Income. The remaining changes in fair value for instruments for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded as net gains/ (losses) on financial instruments held under the fair value option in the Statements of Income. The change in fair value does not include changes in instrument-specific credit risk. For advances and consolidated obligations recorded under the fair value option, the Bank determined that no adjustments to the fair values of these instruments for instrument-specific credit risk were necessary for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
    
  The following table presents the difference between the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding and aggregate fair value of advances and consolidated obligation bonds for which the Bank elected the fair value option at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  :

Note 17     Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  As provided by the FHLBank Act or regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks, all FHLBanks have joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations, which are backed only by the financial resources of the FHLBanks. The joint and several liability regulation authorizes the Finance Agency to require any FHLBank to repay all or a portion of the principal or interest on consolidated obligations for which another FHLBank is the primary obligor. The regulations provide a general framework for addressing the possibility that an FHLBank may be unable to repay the consolidated obligations for which it is the primary obligor. The Bank has never been asked or required to repay the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank, and as of   September 30, 2016  , and through the filing date of this report, does not believe that it is probable that it will be asked to do so. The par value of the outstanding consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks was   $967,728   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $905,202   at   December 31, 2015  . The par value of the Bank s participation in consolidated obligations was   $88,217   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $79,355   at   December 31, 2015  . For more information on the joint and several liability regulation, see  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 20   Commitments and Contingencies  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Off-balance sheet commitments as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows: 

(2) 
    At     September 30, 2016  , $  550   of the commitments to issue consolidated obligation discount notes were hedged with associated interest rate swaps. At   December 31, 2015  ,   none   of the commitments to issue consolidated obligation discount notes were hedged with associated interest rate swaps. 
              (3) 
    At     September 30, 2016  ,   none   of the commitments to issue consolidated obligation bonds were hedged with associated interest rate swaps.   At December 31, 2015, all of the commitments to issue consolidated obligation bonds were hedged with associated interest rate swaps. 
       
  Standby letters of credit are generally issued for a fee on behalf of members to support their obligations to third parties. If the Bank is required to make a payment for a beneficiary s drawing under a letter of credit, the amount is immediately due and payable by the member to the Bank and is charged to the member s demand deposit account with the Bank. The original terms of these standby letters of credit range from   7 days to 15 years  , including a final expiration in   2031  . The Bank monitors the creditworthiness of members that have standby letters of credit. The value of the Bank s obligations related to standby letters of credit is recorded in other liabilities and amounted to   $24   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $18   at   December 31, 2015  . Standby letters of credit are fully collateralized at the time of issuance. Based on the Bank s credit analyses of members  financial condition and collateral requirements,  
  
   55

  Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

the Bank deemed it unnecessary to record any additional liability on the letters of credit outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Commitments to fund advances totaled   $361   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $10   at   December 31, 2015  . Advances funded under advance commitments are fully collateralized at the time of funding (see   Note 9   Allowance for Credit Losses  ). Based on the Bank s credit analyses of members  financial condition and collateral requirements, the Bank deemed it unnecessary to record any additional liability on the advance commitments outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The Bank may enter into commitments that unconditionally obligate it to purchase mortgage loans from its members. Commitments are generally for periods not exceeding   45   days. Delivery commitments are recorded at fair value as derivative assets or derivative liabilities in the Statements of Condition.  
    
  The Bank executes over-the-counter uncleared interest rate exchange agreements with major banks and derivative entities affiliated with broker-dealers and has executed uncleared interest rate exchange agreements in the past with the Bank s members. The Bank enters into master agreements with netting provisions and into bilateral credit support agreements with all active derivative dealer counterparties. All member counterparty master agreements, excluding those with derivative dealers, are subject to the terms of the Bank s Advances and Security Agreement with members, and all member counterparties (except for those that are derivative dealers) must fully collateralize the Bank s net credit exposure. For cleared derivatives, the clearinghouse is the Bank s counterparty, and the Bank has clearing agreements with clearing agents that provide for delivery of initial margin to, and exchange of variation margin with, the clearinghouse. See   Note 15   Derivatives and Hedging Activities   for additional information about the Bank s pledged collateral and other credit-risk-related contingent features. 
    
  The Bank may be subject to various pending legal proceedings that may arise in the ordinary course of business. After consultation with legal counsel, the Bank does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of these matters will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

All transactions with members, nonmembers, and their affiliates are entered into in the ordinary course of business. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , no shareholder owned more than   10%   of the total voting interests in the Bank because of this statutory limit on members' voting rights. For more information on transactions with members and nonmembers, see  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 21   Transactions with Certain Members, Certain Nonmembers, and Other FHLBanks  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Transactions with Other FHLBanks.   The Bank may occasionally enter into transactions with other FHLBanks. These transactions are summarized below. 
    
  Overnight Funds  . The Bank may borrow or lend unsecured overnight funds from or to other FHLBanks. All such transactions are at current market rates. Interest income and interest expense related to these transactions with other FHLBanks are included in other interest income and interest expense from other borrowings in the Statements of Income. Balances outstanding at period end with other FHLBanks, if any, are identified in the Bank s financial statements. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank extended overnight loans to other FHLBanks for   $205   and   $830  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank borrowed   $1,125   and   $4,512  , respectively, from other FHLBanks. The impact to net interest income related to these transactions was de minimis in any period in this report.  
    
  MPF Mortgage Loans  . The Bank pays a transaction services fee to the FHLBank of Chicago for its participation in the MPF program. This fee is assessed monthly and is based on the amount of mortgage loans in which the Bank invested and which remain outstanding on its Statements of Condition. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank recorded   $1   and a de minimis amount, respectively, in MPF transaction services fee expense to the FHLBank of Chicago, which was recorded in the Statements of Income as other expense. In addition, the Bank receives a counterparty fee from the FHLBank of Chicago for facilitating the sale of loans under the MPF program. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank recorded a de minimis amount in MPF counterparty fee income from the FHLBank of Chicago, which was recorded in the Statements of Income as other income. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Bank had no MPF counterparty fee income from the FHLBank of Chicago. 
    
  Consolidated Obligations  . The Bank may, from time to time, transfer to or assume from another FHLBank the outstanding primary liability for FHLBank consolidated obligations. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Bank did not transfer any debt to other FHLBanks or assume any debt from other FHLBanks.     
    
  Transactions with the Office of Finance  . The Bank s proportionate share of the cost of operating the Office of Finance is identified in the Statements of Income. 

Note 19     Subsequent Events       
    
  On October 19, 2016, the Bank s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of   $100   on the capital stock outstanding during the third quarter of 2016, including   $83   in dividends on capital stock and   $17   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. Dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock will be reflected as interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Bank expects to pay the special dividend on November 14, 2016. 
    
  In November 2016, the Bank entered into a settlement agreement with a defendant in connection with the Bank s PLRMBS for the amount of   $49   (after netting certain legal fees and expenses).  
    
  There were no other material subsequent events identified, subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , until the time of the Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Table of Contents  

This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in 
  conjunction with the Bank s interim financial statements and notes and the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Quarterly Overview  
    
  Net   income   for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $291 million  , compared with net income of   $46 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   $245 million     increase   in net income for the   third   quarter of   2016     relative to the prior-year period primarily reflected $240 million in gains (after netting certain legal fees and expenses) on settlements relating to the Bank's private-label residential mortgage-backed securities (PLRMBS) litigation. 
    
  Net interest income for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $123 million  ,   up   from   $119 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The   increase     was primarily due to an increase in earnings from higher average advance balances, partially offset by higher dividends paid on mandatory redeemable capital stock (which are classified as interest expense)  .  
    
  Other income/(loss) for the   third   quarter of   2016  , excluding the gain from litigation settlements, was   income   of $  1 million  , compared with a   loss   of   $33 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  .   The change in other income/(loss) reflected net fair value   gains     associated with derivatives, hedged items, and financial instruments carried at fair value of     $5 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016, compared with net fair value   losses   of   $30 million   for the   third   quarter of 2015.   The change in net fair value gains or losses was primarily due to the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors during the period. The change in other income/(loss) also reflected a partially offsetting impact of expense of $7 million on derivative instruments used in economic hedges, compared with expense of $1 million for the third quarter of 2015. Income/expense on derivative instruments used in economic hedges is generally offset by interest expense/income on the economically hedged assets and liabilities. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , total assets   increase  d   $9.9 billion  , to   $95.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $85.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Advances   increase  d   $5.0 billion  , or   9.8%  , to   $55.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $50.9 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . In addition, investments   increased     $6.5 billion  , to   $38.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $32.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  ,   primarily reflecting an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell and Federal funds sold. These increases were partially offset by   a   $1.6 billion     decrease   in cash and due from banks.  
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive income increased by $69 million during the first nine months of 2016, to $84 million at September 30, 2016, from     $15 million at December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of improvement in the fair value of PLRMBS classified as available-for-sale.    
    
  On October 19, 2016, the Bank s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $100 million on the capital stock outstanding during the third quarter of 2016, including   $83   million in dividends on capital stock and   $17 million   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The Bank recorded the special dividend on October 19, 2016. On   October 27, 2016  , the Bank s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the capital stock outstanding during the   third   quarter of   2016   at an annualized rate of   8.94%  . The quarterly dividend totaled   $66 million  , including   $11 million   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The Bank recorded the quarterly dividend on   October 27, 2016  . The Bank expects to pay both the special dividend and the quarterly dividend on   November 14, 2016  . Dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock will be recognized as interest expense in the   fourth   quarter of   2016  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank was in compliance with all of its regulatory capital requirements. The Bank s total regulatory capital ratio was   6.2%  , exceeding the   4.0%   requirement. The Bank had   $6.0 billion   in permanent capital, exceeding its risk-based capital requirement of   $2.4 billion  . Total retained earnings as of   September 30, 2016  , were   $3.1 billion  .

    As provided by the FHLBank Act or regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks, all of the FHLBanks have joint and several liability for FHLBank consolidated obligations, which are backed only by the financial resources of the FHLBanks. The joint and several liability regulation authorizes the Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency) to require any FHLBank to repay all or a portion of the principal or interest on consolidated obligations for which another FHLBank is the primary obligor. The Bank has never been asked or required to repay the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank, and as of   September 30, 2016  , and through the filing date of this report, does not believe that it is probable that it will be asked to do so. The par value of the outstanding consolidated obligations of all FHLBanks at the dates indicated was as follows:

    Net interest margin is net interest income (annualized) divided by average interest-earning assets. 
              (4) 
    This ratio is calculated as dividends per share divided by net income per share. 
              (5) 
    This ratio is calculated as regulatory capital divided by total assets. Regulatory capital includes retained earnings, Class B capital stock, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock (which is classified as a liability), but excludes AOCI. 

Results of Operations  
    
  The primary source of the Bank s earnings is net interest income, which is the interest earned on advances, 
  mortgage loans, and investments, less interest paid on consolidated obligations, deposits, mandatorily redeemable 
  capital stock, and other borrowings. The Average Balance Sheets tables that follow present the average balances of interest-earning asset categories and the sources that funded those interest-earning assets (liabilities and capital) for  the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , together with the related interest income and expense. They also present the average rates on total interest-earning assets and the average costs of total funding sources.

The following table details the changes in interest income and interest expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  .

  The net interest margin was   51   basis points for the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   3   basis points   lower   than the net interest margin for the   third   quarter of   2015  , which was   54   basis points. The net interest spread was   48   basis points for the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   3   basis point   lower   than the net interest spread for the   third   quarter of   2015  , which was   51

basis points. These decreases were primarily due to lower average balances of mortgage-related assets, and higher dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock, which are classified as interest expense. 
    
  For securities previously identified as other-than-temporarily impaired, the Bank updates its estimate of future 
  estimated cash flows on a regular basis. If there is no additional impairment on the security, the yield of the security 
  is adjusted upward on a prospective basis and accreted into interest income when there is a significant increase in 
  the expected cash flows. As a result of improvements in the estimated cash flows of securities previously 
  identified as other-than-temporarily impaired, the accretion of yield adjustments is likely to continue to be a 
  positive source of net interest income in future periods. 
    
  Member demand for wholesale funding from the Bank can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including economic and market conditions, competition from other wholesale funding sources, member deposit inflows and outflows, the activity level of the primary and secondary mortgage markets, and strategic decisions made by individual member institutions. As a result, Bank asset levels and operating results may vary significantly from period to period.

Under the fair value option, the Bank elected to carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. In general, transactions elected for the fair value option are in economic hedge relationships. Gains or losses on these transactions are generally offset by losses or gains on the derivatives that economically hedge these instruments. 
    
  The net gains/(losses) on advances and consolidated obligation bonds held under the fair value option were primarily driven by the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors relative to the actual terms on the advances and consolidated obligation bonds during the period.

During the   third   quarter of   2016  , net   gains   on derivatives and hedging activities totaled   $15 million   compared to net   losses   of   $33 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  .

2016   and   2015  , respectively. Excluding the impact of income or expense from net settlements on derivative instruments used in economic hedges, the net gains or losses on fair value and economic hedges were primarily associated with the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors during the period.

  Dividends and Retained Earnings 
    
  The Bank s Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework summarizes the Bank s capital management principles and objectives, as well as its policies and practices with respect to restricted retained earnings, dividend payments, and the repurchase of excess capital stock. 
    
  Under regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks, dividends may be paid only out of current net earnings or previously retained earnings. As required by the regulations, the Bank s Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework is reviewed at least annually by the Bank s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may amend the Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework from time to time. In accordance with the Bank s Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework, the Bank retains certain amounts in restricted retained earnings, which are not made available for dividends in the current dividend period. The Bank may be restricted from paying dividends if it is not in compliance with any of its minimum capital requirements or if payment would cause the Bank to fail to meet any of its minimum capital requirements. In addition, the Bank may not pay dividends if any principal or interest due on any consolidated obligation has not been paid in full or is not expected to be paid in full, or, under certain circumstances, if the Bank fails to satisfy certain liquidity requirements under applicable regulations. 
    
  The regulatory liquidity requirements state that each FHLBank must: (i) maintain eligible high quality assets (advances with a maturity not exceeding five years, U.S. Treasury securities investments, and deposits in banks or trust companies) in an amount equal to or greater than the deposits received from members, and (ii) hold contingent liquidity in an amount sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for at least five business days without access to the consolidated obligations markets. At   September 30, 2016  , advances maturing within five years totaled   $54.2 billion  , significantly in excess of the   $182 million   of member deposits on that date. At   December 31, 2015  , advances maturing within five years totaled   $44.2 billion  , also significantly in excess of the   $127 million   of member deposits on that date. In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank held estimated total sources

of funds in an amount that would have allowed the Bank to meet its liquidity needs for more than 5 consecutive business days without issuing new consolidated obligations, subject to certain conditions. For more information, see  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition   Risk Management   Liquidity Risk  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  The Bank s Risk Management Policy limits the payment of dividends based on the ratio of the Bank s estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock. If this ratio at the end of any quarter is less than 100% but greater than or equal to 70%, any dividend would be limited to an annualized rate no greater than the daily average of the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for the applicable quarter (subject to certain conditions), and if this ratio is less than 70%, the Bank would be restricted from paying a dividend. The ratio of the Bank s estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock was   214%   as of   September 30, 2016  . For more information, see  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition   Risk Management   Market Risk  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Retained Earnings Related to Valuation Adjustments     In accordance with the Bank s Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework, the Bank retains in restricted retained earnings any cumulative net gains in earnings (net of applicable assessments) resulting from valuation adjustments.  
    
  In general, the Bank s derivatives and hedged instruments, as well as certain assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value, are held to the maturity, call, or put date. For these financial instruments, net valuation gains or losses are primarily a matter of timing and will generally reverse through changes in future valuations and settlements of contractual interest cash flows over the remaining contractual terms to maturity, or by the exercised call or put dates. However, the Bank may have instances in which hedging relationships are terminated prior to maturity or prior to the call or put dates. Terminating the hedging relationship may result in a realized gain or loss. In addition, the Bank may have instances in which it may sell trading securities prior to maturity, which may also result in a realized gain or loss.  
    
  The purpose of retaining cumulative net gains in earnings resulting from valuation adjustments as restricted retained earnings is to provide sufficient retained earnings to offset future net losses that result from the reversal of cumulative net gains, so that potential dividend payouts in future periods are not necessarily affected by the reversals of these gains. Although restricting retained earnings in this way may preserve the Bank s ability to pay dividends, the reversal of cumulative net gains in any given period may result in a net loss if the reversal exceeds net earnings before the impact of valuation adjustments for that period.  
    
  The Bank did not have any retained earnings related to valuation adjustments at   September 30, 2016  . Retained earnings related to valuation adjustments totaled   $10 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Retained Earnings Related to Loss Protection and Capital Compliance     In addition to any cumulative net gains resulting from valuation adjustments, the Bank holds an additional amount in restricted retained earnings intended to protect paid-in capital from the effects of an extremely adverse credit event, an extremely adverse operations risk event, a cumulative net loss related to the Bank s derivatives and associated hedged items and financial instruments carried at fair value, an extremely adverse change in the market value of the Bank s capital, a significant amount of additional credit-related OTTI on PLRMBS, or some combination of these effects, especially in periods of extremely low net income resulting from an adverse interest rate environment, and to maintain capital compliance.  
    
  On July 31, 2015, the Board of Directors set the required amount of restricted retained earnings for loss protection and capital compliance at   $2.0 billion  . Restricted retained earnings available to meet this requirement include amounts related to the Bank s buildup of retained earnings and to the Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement, but exclude retained earnings related to valuation adjustments. Restricted retained earnings for loss protection and capital compliance were   $2.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  This restricted retained earnings requirement may be changed at any time. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the retained earnings methodology and analysis to determine whether any adjustments are appropriate.

Buildup of Retained Earnings       As of March 31, 2012, the Bank reached the   $1.8 billion   target for the buildup of retained earnings that had previously been set by the Board of Directors. On July 31, 2015, the Board of Directors lowered the requirement to   $1.65 billion   and transferred   $150 million   to unrestricted retained earnings. 
    
  Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement       In 2011, the FHLBanks entered into a Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement, as amended (JCE Agreement), intended to enhance the capital position of each FHLBank by allocating a portion of each FHLBank s earnings to a separate retained earnings account at that FHLBank. In accordance with the JCE Agreement, each FHLBank is required to allocate 20% of its net income each quarter to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the balance of the account equals at least 1% of that FHLBank s average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter. Under the JCE Agreement, these restricted retained earnings will not be available to pay dividends. 
    
  Retained earnings related to the JCE Agreement totaled   $475 million   and   $358 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Dividend Payments     Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency) rules state that FHLBanks may declare and pay dividends only from previously retained earnings or current net earnings, and may not declare or pay dividends based on projected or anticipated earnings. There is no requirement that the Board of Directors declare and pay any dividend. A decision by the Board of Directors to declare or not declare a dividend is a discretionary matter and is subject to the requirements and restrictions of the FHLBank Act and applicable requirements under the regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks. 
    
  In addition, Finance Agency rules do not permit the Bank to pay dividends in the form of capital stock if its excess 
  capital stock exceeds 1% of its total assets. Excess capital stock is defined as the aggregate of the capital stock held by each shareholder in excess of its minimum capital stock requirement, as established by the Bank s capital plan. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s excess capital stock totaled   $383 million  , or   0.40%   of total assets. 
    
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of   9.17%  , totaling   $63 million  , including   $52 million   in dividends on capital stock and   $11 million   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. In the   third   quarter of   2015  , the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of   10.01%  , totaling   $79 million  , including   $72 million   in dividends on capital stock and   $7 million   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
    
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of   8.70%  , totaling   $179 million  , including   $146 million   in dividends on capital stock and   $33 million   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. In the first   nine   months of   2015  , the Bank paid dividends at an annualized rate of   13.30%  , totaling   $373 million  , of which $145 million was related to the special dividend. The total dividend paid included   $313 million   in dividends on capital stock and   $60 million   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock.  
    
  The Bank paid these dividends in cash. Dividends on capital stock are recognized as dividends on the Statements of Capital Accounts, and dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock are recognized as interest expense on the Statements of Income. 
    
  On October 19, 2016, the Bank s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $100 million on the capital stock outstanding during the third quarter of 2016, including   $83   million in dividends on capital stock and   $17   million in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The Bank recorded the special dividend on October 19, 2016. On   October 27, 2016  , the Bank s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the capital stock outstanding during the   third   quarter of   2016   at an annualized rate of   8.94%   totaling   $66 million  , including   $55 million   in dividends on capital stock and   $11 million   in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The Bank recorded the quarterly dividend on   October 27, 2016  . The Bank expects to pay both the special dividend and the quarterly dividend on   November 14, 2016  . Dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock will be recognized as interest expense in the   fourth   quarter of 2016.

The Bank will continue to monitor the condition of its PLRMBS portfolio, the ratio of the Bank s estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock, its overall financial performance and retained earnings, developments in the mortgage and credit markets, and other relevant information as the basis for determining the payment of dividends in future quarters. 

Financial Condition  
    
  Total assets were   $95.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $85.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Advances   increase  d by   $5.0 billion  , or   10%  , to   $55.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $50.9 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . MBS   increased   by   $1.0 billion  , or   6%  , to   $17.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $16.0 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Average total assets were   $96.3 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , a   10%     increase   compared to   $87.5 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Average total assets were   $91.3 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , an   11%     increase   compared to   $82.4 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Average advances were   $65.6 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , a   16%     increase   from   $56.7 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Average advances were   $62.4 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , a   25%     increase   from   $50.1 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Average MBS were   $15.7 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , an   8%     decrease   from   $17.1 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Average MBS were   $15.4 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , a   15%     decrease   from   $18.1 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015 
    
  Advances outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , included unrealized   gains   of   $147 million  , of which   $63 million   represented unrealized   gains   on advances hedged in accordance with the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and   $84 million   represented unrealized   gains   on economically hedged advances that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. Advances outstanding at   December 31, 2015  , included unrealized gains of   $78 million  , of which   $40 million   represented unrealized gains on advances hedged in accordance with the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and   $38 million   represented unrealized gains on economically hedged advances that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. The overall   increase   in the unrealized gains on the hedged advances and advances carried at fair value from   December 31, 2015  , to   September 30, 2016  , was primarily attributable to the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors relative to the terms on the Bank s advances during the period.  
    
  Total liabilities were   $90.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $9.3 billion   from   $80.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily reflecting an   increase   in consolidated obligations outstanding from   $79.5 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , to   $88.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . The   increase   in consolidated obligations outstanding paralleled the   increase   in assets during the first   nine   months of   2016  . Average total liabilities were   $90.8 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , a   10%     increase   compared to   $82.3 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Average total liabilities were   $86.2 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , a   12%     increase   compared to   $76.7 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Average consolidated obligations were   $89.1 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $80.4 billion   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Average consolidated obligations were   $84.6 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   $74.8 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  Consolidated obligations outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , included unrealized   losses   of   $56 million   on consolidated obligation bonds hedged in accordance with the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and unrealized   losses   of   $2 million   on economically hedged consolidated obligation bonds that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. Consolidated obligations outstanding at   December 31, 2015  , included unrealized losses of   $142 million   on consolidated obligation bonds hedged in accordance with the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and unrealized gains of   $17 million   on economically hedged consolidated obligation bonds that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. The   decrease   in the unrealized   losses   on the hedged consolidated obligation bonds and on the consolidated obligation bonds carried at fair value from   December 31, 2015  , to   September 30, 2016  , were primarily attributable to the effects of changes in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors relative to the actual terms on the Bank's consolidated obligation bonds during the period.

As provided by the FHLBank Act or regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks, all FHLBanks have joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations. The joint and several liability regulation authorizes the Finance Agency to require any FHLBank to repay all or a portion of the principal or interest on consolidated obligations for which another FHLBank is the primary obligor. The Bank has never been asked or required to repay the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank, and as of   September 30, 2016  , and through the filing date of this report, does not believe that it is probable that it will be asked to do so. The par value of the outstanding consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks was   $967.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $905.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Changes in the long-term credit ratings of individual FHLBanks do not necessarily affect the credit rating of the consolidated obligations issued on behalf of the FHLBanks. Rating agencies may change or withdraw a rating from time to time because of various factors, including operating results or actions taken, business developments, or changes in their opinion regarding, among other factors, the general outlook for a particular industry or the economy.  
    
  The Bank evaluated the publicly disclosed FHLBank regulatory actions and long-term credit ratings of the other FHLBanks as of   September 30, 2016  , and as of each period end presented, and does not believe, as of the date of this report, that it is probable that the Bank will be required to repay any principal or interest associated with consolidated obligations for which the Bank is not the primary obligor.  
    
  The Bank s financial condition is further discussed under  Segment Information.  
   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Segment Information 
    
  The Bank uses an analysis of financial performance based on the balances and adjusted net interest income of two operating segments, the advances-related business and the mortgage-related business, as well as other financial information, to review and assess financial performance and to determine the allocation of resources to these two major business segments. For purposes of segment reporting, adjusted net interest income includes income and expense associated with net settlements from economic hedges that are recorded in  Net gain/(loss) on derivatives and hedging activities  in other income and excludes interest expense that is recorded in  Mandatorily redeemable capital stock.  Other key financial information, such as any credit-related OTTI losses on the Bank s PLRMBS, other expenses, and assessments, is not included in the segment reporting analysis, but is incorporated into the Bank s overall assessment of financial performance. For a reconciliation of the Bank s operating segment adjusted net interest income to the Bank s total net interest income, see    Item 1. Financial Statements       Note 14   Segment Information  .  
    
  Advances-Related Business.   The advances-related business consists of advances and other credit products, related financing and hedging instruments, and liquidity and other non-MBS investments associated with the Bank s role as a liquidity provider, and capital. Assets associated with this segment   increased     $8.9 billion   to   $77.9 billion   (  82%   of total assets) at   September 30, 2016  , from   $69.0 billion   (  81%   of total assets) at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Adjusted net interest income for this segment is derived primarily from the difference, or spread, between the yield on advances and non-MBS investments and the cost of the consolidated obligations funding these assets, including the net settlements from associated interest rate exchange agreements, and from earnings on capital. 
    
  Adjusted net interest income for this segment was   $42 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , an   increase   of   $4 million  , or   11%  , compared with   $38 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . In the first   nine   months of   2016  , adjusted net interest income for this segment was   $115 million  , a   decrease   of   $5 million  , or   4%  , compared to   $120 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The   increase   in adjusted net interest income for the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to an increase in earnings on higher advances balances and advance prepayment fees. The decrease for the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to a decline in spreads on advances-related assets and lower earnings from advance prepayment fees, partially offset by an increase in earnings because of higher advance balances.

Adjusted net interest income for this segment represented   33%   and   31%   of total adjusted net interest income for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , and   31%   of total adjusted net interest income for the first   nine   months of both   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Members and nonmember borrowers prepaid   $896 million   of advances in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $272 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Interest income was increased by net prepayment fees of   $3 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   and   $1 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Members and nonmember borrowers prepaid   $2.8 billion   of advances in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $1.5 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . Interest income was increased by net prepayment fees of   $5 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   $9 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  Advances     The par value of advances outstanding   increased   by   $4.9 billion  , or   10%  , to   $55.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $50.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Average advances outstanding were   $65.6 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , a   16%     increase   from   $56.7 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Average advances outstanding were   $62.4 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , a   25%     increase   from   $50.1 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , advances outstanding to the Bank s top five borrowers and their affiliates   increase  d by   $1.6 billion  , and advances outstanding to the Bank s other borrowers   increase  d by   $3.3 billion  . Advances to the top five borrowers   increase  d to   $33.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from $31.7 billion at   December 31, 2015  . (See    Item 1. Financial Statements       Note 7   Advances    Credit and Concentration Risk  and    Item 1. Financial Statements       Note 13   Capital     Concentration  for further information.) The top five borrowers included JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, whose advances and capital stock exceeded 10% of the Bank s total advances and capital stock, respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  , and as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The   $4.9 billion     increase   in advances outstanding primarily reflected a   $7.2 billion     increase   in fixed rate advances and by a   $0.3 billion     increase   in adjustable rate advances, partially offset a   $2.6 billion     decrease   in variable rate advances. 
    
  The components of the advances portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are presented in the following table.

    Partial prepayment symmetry (PPS) is a product feature under which the Bank may charge the borrower a prepayment fee or pay the borrower a prepayment credit, depending on certain circumstances, such as movements in interest rates, when the advance is prepaid. Any prepayment credit on an advance with PPS would be limited to the lesser of 10% of the par value of the advance or the gain recognized on the termination of the associated interest rate swap, which may also include a similar contractual gain limitation. 
       
  For a discussion of advances credit risk, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Risk Management   Credit Risk   Advances.  
    
  Non-MBS Investments         The Bank s non-MBS investment portfolio consists of financial instruments that are used primarily to facilitate the Bank s role as a cost-effective provider of credit and liquidity to members and to support the operations of the Bank. The Bank s total non-MBS investment portfolio was   $21.8 billion   and   $16.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The   increase   in the total size of the non-MBS investment portfolio reflects higher balances of Federal funds sold, short-term securities purchased under agreements to resell, and agency securities.  
    
  Cash and Due from Banks     Cash and due from banks was   $35 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a   $1.6 billion     decrease   compared to   December 31, 2015  . Cash and due from banks declined due to the availability of other investment opportunities. 
    
  Borrowings     Total liabilities (primarily consolidated obligations) funding the advances-related business   increased   to   $72.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $64.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . For further information and discussion of the Bank s joint and several liability for FHLBank consolidated obligations, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Financial Condition  and    Item 1. Financial Statements       Note 17   Commitments and Contingencies  .  
    
  To meet the specific needs of certain investors, fixed and adjustable rate consolidated obligation bonds may contain embedded call options or other features that result in complex coupon payment terms. When these consolidated obligation bonds are issued on behalf of the Bank, typically the Bank simultaneously enters into interest rate  
  
   78 

Table of Contents  

exchange agreements with features that offset the complex features of the bonds and, in effect, convert the bonds to adjustable rate instruments tied to an index, primarily LIBOR. For example, the Bank uses fixed rate callable bonds that are typically offset with interest rate exchange agreements with call features that offset the call options embedded in the callable bonds. This combined financing structure enables the Bank to meet its funding needs at costs not generally attainable solely through the issuance of comparable term non-callable debt.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the notional amount of interest rate exchange agreements associated with the advances-related business totaled   $61.5 billion  , of which   $15.0 billion   were hedging advances,   $45.7 billion   were hedging consolidated obligations, and   $0.8 billion   were economically hedging trading securities. At   December 31, 2015  , the notional amount of interest rate exchange agreements associated with the advances-related business totaled   $72.6 billion  , of which   $17.4 billion   were hedging advances,   $54.6 billion   were hedging consolidated obligations, and   $0.5 billion   were economically hedging trading securities, and $0.1 billion were offsetting derivatives. The hedges associated with advances and consolidated obligations were primarily used to convert the fixed rate cash flows and non-LIBOR-indexed cash flows of the advances and consolidated obligations to adjustable rate LIBOR-indexed cash flows or to manage the interest rate sensitivity and net repricing gaps of assets, liabilities, and interest rate exchange agreements.  
    
  FHLBank System consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes, along with similar debt securities issued by other GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are generally referred to as agency debt. The costs of debt issued by the FHLBanks and the other GSEs generally rise and fall with increases and decreases in general market interest rates.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , rates on 3-month U.S. Treasury bills and 3-month LIBOR increased, while rates on 2-year and 5-year U.S. Treasury notes decreased compared with December 31, 2015. 

The following table presents a comparison of the average issuance cost of FHLBank System consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes converted to LIBOR-indexed liabilities through interest rate swaps in the first   nine   months of 2016 and 2015. The average issuance cost of consolidated obligation bonds relative to LIBOR was more expensive in the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, while the average cost of consolidated obligation discount notes improved over the same period. 

Mortgage-Related Business.   The mortgage-related business consists of MBS investments, mortgage loans acquired through the Mortgage Partnership Finance (MPF) Program, and the related financing and hedging instruments. Adjusted net interest income for this segment is derived primarily from the difference, or spread, between the yield on the MBS and mortgage loans and the cost of the consolidated obligations funding those assets, including the net settlements from associated interest rate exchange agreements.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , assets associated with this segment were   $17.7 billion   (  18%   of total assets),   an increase   of   $1.0 billion   from   $16.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015   (  19%   of total assets).  
    
  Adjusted net interest income for this segment was   $84 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , the same as   $84 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . In the first   nine   months of   2016  , adjusted net interest income for this segment was   $254 million  ,   decrease   of   $13 million  , or   5%  , from   $267 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . The   decrease  s in adjusted net interest income for the third quarter of 2016 and for the first nine months of 2016 were primarily due to lower average balances of MBS investments and mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase in accretion of yield adjustments on certain other-than-temporarily impaired PLRMBS, resulting from improvement in expected cash flows and higher spreads on mortgage-related assets. 
    
  Adjusted net interest income for this segment represented   67%   and   69%   of total adjusted net interest income for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , and   69%   of total adjusted net interest income for the first   nine   months of both   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  MBS Investments     The Bank s MBS portfolio was   $17.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $16.0 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Bank s MBS portfolio   increased   primarily because of   $3.8 billion   in new MBS investments, including   $0.4 billion   in MBS investments that were traded but not yet settled, partially offset by principal repayments totaling   $2.9 billion  . In the   third   quarter of   2016  , average MBS investments were   $15.7 billion  , a   decrease   of   $1.4 billion   from   $17.1 billion   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Average MBS investments were   $15.4 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , a   decrease   of   $2.7 billion   from   $18.1 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . For a discussion of the composition of the Bank s MBS portfolio and the Bank s OTTI analysis of that portfolio, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Risk Management   Investments  and    Item 1. Financial Statements       Note 6   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Analysis  .  
    
  Intermediate-term and long-term fixed rate MBS investments are subject to prepayment risk, and intermediate-term and long-term adjustable rate MBS investments are also subject to interest rate cap risk. The Bank has managed these risks predominately by purchasing intermediate-term fixed rate MBS (rather than long-term fixed rate MBS), funding the fixed rate MBS with a mix of non-callable and callable debt, and using interest rate exchange agreements with interest rate risk characteristics similar to callable debt. The Bank has purchased interest rate caps to hedge some of the interest rate cap risk associated with the long-term adjustable rate MBS investments. 
    
  MPF Program     Under the MPF Program, the Bank may purchase from members, for its own portfolio, conventional conforming fixed rate mortgage loans under the MPF Original product and mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) under the MPF Government product. In addition, the Bank may facilitate the purchase of conforming fixed rate mortgage loans from members for concurrent sale to Fannie Mae under the MPF Xtra product; of jumbo mortgage loans for concurrent sale to Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation, a subsidiary of Redwood Trust, Inc., a real estate investment trust, under the MPF Direct product; and of government-insured or government-guaranteed mortgage loans that will be packaged into securities backed by the mortgage loans and guaranteed by Ginnie Mae under the MPF Government MBS product. When members sell mortgage loans under the MPF Xtra, MPF Direct, and MPF Government MBS products, the loans are sold to a third-party investor and are not recorded on the Bank s Statements of Condition.   
    
  From May 2002 through October 2006, the Bank purchased conventional conforming fixed rate mortgage loans from its participating financial institutions under the MPF Original and MPF Plus products. Participating members originated or purchased the mortgage loans, credit-enhanced them and sold them to the Bank, and generally retained the servicing of the loans.

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had approved   16   members as participating financial institutions since renewing its participation in the MPF Program in 2013. The Bank purchased   $150 million   in eligible loans under the MPF Original product during the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
    
  Mortgage loan balances   increase  d to   $677 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $655 million   at   December 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $22 million  . Average mortgage loans were   $644 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , a   decrease   of   $25 million   from   $669 million   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Average mortgage loans were   $637 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , a   decrease   of $  42 million   from   $679 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank held conventional conforming fixed rate mortgage loans purchased under one of two MPF products, MPF Plus or MPF Original, which are described in greater detail in  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Risk Management   Credit Risk   MPF Program.  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K.

  The notional amount of interest rate exchange agreements associated with the mortgage-related business totaled   $5.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , of which   $3.5 billion   were hedging or were associated with consolidated obligations funding the mortgage portfolio and   $2.2 billion   were associated with MBS. The notional amount of interest rate exchange agreements associated with the mortgage-related business totaled   $7.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , of which   $5.0 billion   were hedging or were associated with consolidated obligations funding the mortgage portfolio and   $2.2 billion   were associated with MBS. 

Interest Rate Exchange Agreements 
    
  A derivative transaction or interest rate exchange agreement is a financial contract whose fair value is generally derived from changes in the value of an underlying asset or liability. The Bank uses interest rate swaps; interest rate

cap and floor agreements; and callable and putable interest rate swaps (collectively, interest rate exchange agreements) to manage its exposure to interest rate risks inherent in its ordinary course of business, including its lending, investment, and funding activities. For more information on the primary strategies that the Bank employs for using interest rate exchange agreements and the associated market risks, see  Item 7.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Bank s financial strategies are designed to enable the Bank to expand and contract its assets, liabilities, and capital as membership composition and member credit needs change. The Bank s liquidity and capital resources are designed to support its financial strategies. The Bank s primary source of liquidity is its access to the debt capital markets through consolidated obligation issuance. The maintenance of the Bank s capital resources are governed by its capital plan. 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  The Bank strives to maintain the liquidity necessary to repay maturing consolidated obligations for which it is the primary obligor, meet other obligations and commitments, and meet expected and unexpected member credit demands. The Bank monitors its financial position in order to maintain ready access to sufficient liquid funds to meet normal transaction requirements, take advantage of appropriate investment opportunities, and cover unforeseen liquidity demands. 
    
  The Bank generally manages operational, contingent, and structural liquidity risks using a portfolio of cash and short-term investments and access to the debt capital markets. In addition, the Bank maintains alternate sources of funds, detailed in its contingent liquidity plan, which also includes an explanation of how sources of funds may be allocated under stressed market conditions, such as short-term operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance or short-term disruptions in the debt capital markets. The Bank maintains short-term, high-quality money market investments and government and agency securities in amounts that may average up to three times the Bank s capital as a primary source of funds to satisfy these requirements and objectives.

Table of Contents  

The Bank has a regulatory contingent liquidity requirement to maintain at least 5 business days of liquidity to enable it to meet its obligations without issuance of new consolidated obligations. In addition, the Finance Agency has established liquidity guidelines     that     require each FHLBank to maintain sufficient on-balance sheet liquidity in an amount at least equal to its anticipated cash outflows for two different scenarios. Both scenarios assume no new consolidated obligation issuance and no reliance on repurchase agreements and permit the sale of certain existing investments as determined by the Finance Agency. The two scenarios differ only in the treatment of maturing advances. One scenario assumes that the Bank does not renew any maturing advances. For this scenario, the Bank must have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations for 15 calendar days. The second scenario requires the Bank to renew maturing advances for certain members based on specific criteria established by the Finance Agency. For this scenario, the Bank must have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations for 5 calendar days.  
    
  In addition to the regulatory contingent liquidity requirement and the Finance Agency s guidelines on contingent liquidity, the Bank models its cash commitments and expected cash flows on a daily basis to determine its projected liquidity position. If a market or operational disruption occurred that prevented the issuance of new consolidated obligations, the Bank could meet its obligations by: (i) allowing short-term liquid investments to mature, (ii) using eligible securities as collateral for repurchase agreement borrowings, and (iii) if necessary, allowing advances to mature without renewal. In addition, the Bank may be able to borrow on a short-term unsecured basis from other financial institutions (Federal funds purchased) or other FHLBanks (inter-FHLBank borrowings). 
    
  The Bank actively monitors and manages structural liquidity risks, which the Bank defines as maturity mismatches greater than 90 days for sources and uses of funds, of the advances business segment. Structural liquidity maturity mismatches are identified using maturity gap analysis and valuation sensitivity metrics that quantify the risk associated with the Bank s structural liquidity position. 
    
  The following table shows the Bank s principal financial obligations due, estimated sources of funds available to meet those obligations, and the net difference between funds available and funds needed for the 5-business-day period following   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
    
  The FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations specify that each FHLBank must meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards. The Bank must maintain: (i) total regulatory capital in an amount equal to at least 4% of its total assets, (ii) leverage capital in an amount equal to at least 5% of its total assets, and (iii) permanent capital in an amount that is greater than or equal to its risk-based capital requirement. Because the Bank issues only Class B stock, regulatory capital and permanent capital for the Bank are both composed of retained earnings and Class B stock, including mandatorily redeemable capital stock (which is classified as a liability for financial reporting purposes). Regulatory capital and permanent capital do not include AOCI. Leverage capital is defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted by a 1.5 multiplier plus non-permanent capital. The risk-based capital requirement is equal to the sum of the Bank s credit risk, market risk, and operations risk capital requirements, all of which are calculated in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Finance Agency. 
    
  The following table shows the Bank s compliance with the Finance Agency s capital requirements at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . The Bank s risk-based capital requirement   decreased   to   $2.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $2.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .     

The Bank repurchased   $663 million   in excess capital stock during the first   nine   months of   2016  . As a result of recent changes in the Bank s capital plan, both capital stock and retained earnings are required to support regulatory capital compliance.  
    
  On May 29, 2015, the Bank's Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework was revised to reinstate the Bank s practice of repurchasing the surplus capital stock of all members and the excess capital stock of all nonmember shareholders on a regular quarterly basis, at the Bank s discretion and subject to certain statutory and regulatory requirements and to the Bank s Risk Management Policy and capital plan limitations. Surplus capital stock is defined as any stock holdings in excess of 115% of a member s minimum stock requirement, and excess capital stock is defined as any stock holdings in excess of a shareholder s minimum stock requirement. In addition, at the Bank s discretion, all of the excess stock held by a member may be repurchased upon request of the member, subject to the requirements and limitations mentioned above. In accordance with the revised Excess Stock Repurchase, Retained Earnings, and Dividend Framework, each quarter Bank management evaluates and determines the amount of capital stock to be repurchased in that quarter, if any, giving consideration to certain capital metrics and capital management objectives and strategies, and subject to the requirements and limitations listed above. At least 15 calendar days before any repurchase, the Bank will notify shareholders of its intention to repurchase capital stock and of the scheduled repurchase date. On the scheduled repurchase date, the Bank will calculate the amount of stock to be repurchased to ensure that each member and former nonmember shareholder will continue to meet its minimum stock requirement after the repurchase. 
    
  In accordance with its practice, the Bank plans to repurchase the surplus capital stock of all members and the excess capital stock of all nonmember shareholders on   November 15, 2016  .

Risk Management  
    
  The Bank has an integrated corporate governance and internal control framework designed to support effective management of the Bank s business activities and the risks inherent in these activities. As part of this framework, the Bank s Board of Directors has adopted a Risk Governance Policy that outlines the key roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and management and sets forth how the Bank is organized to achieve its risk management objectives, including the implementation of the Bank s strategic objectives, risk management strategies, corporate governance, and standards of conduct. The policy also establishes the Bank s risk governance organizational structure and identifies the general roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and management in establishing risk management policies, procedures, and guidelines; in overseeing the enterprise risk profile; and in implementing enterprise risk management processes and business strategies. The policy establishes an independent risk oversight function to identify, assess, measure, monitor, and report on the enterprise risk profile and risk management capabilities of the Bank. For more information, see  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Risk Management  in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 

Advances.   The Bank manages the credit risk of advances and other credit products by setting the credit and collateral terms available to individual members and housing associates based on their creditworthiness and on the quality and value of the assets they pledge as collateral. The Bank also has procedures to assess the mortgage loan quality and documentation standards of institutions that pledge mortgage loan collateral. In addition, the Bank has collateral policies and restricted lending procedures in place to help manage its exposure to institutions that experience difficulty in meeting their capital requirements or other standards of creditworthiness. These credit and collateral policies balance the Bank s dual goals of meeting the needs of members and housing associates as a reliable source of liquidity and mitigating credit risk by adjusting credit and collateral terms in view of deterioration in creditworthiness. The Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance. 
    
  The Bank determines the maximum amount and maximum term of the advances it will make to a member or housing associate based on the institution s creditworthiness and eligible collateral pledged in accordance with the Bank s credit and collateral policies and regulatory requirements. The Bank may review and change the maximum amount and maximum term at any time. The maximum amount a member or housing associate may borrow is also limited by the amount and type of collateral pledged because all advances must be fully collateralized. 
    
  To identify the credit strength of each borrower and potential borrower, other than insurance companies, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), and housing associates, the Bank assigns each member and each nonmember borrower an internal credit quality rating from one to ten, with one as the highest credit quality rating. These ratings are based on results from the Bank s credit model, which considers financial, regulatory, and other qualitative information, including regulatory examination reports. The internal ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis using current available information and are revised, if necessary, to reflect the institution s current financial position. Credit and collateral terms may be adjusted based on the results of this credit analysis.  
    
  The Bank determines the maximum amount and maximum term of the advances it will make to an insurance company based on an ongoing risk assessment that considers the member's financial and regulatory standing and other qualitative information deemed relevant by the Bank. This evaluation results in the assignment of an internal credit quality rating from one to ten, with one as the highest credit quality rating. Approved terms are designed to meet the needs of the individual member while mitigating the unique credit and collateral risks associated with insurance companies, including risks related to the resolution process for insurance companies, which is significantly different from the resolution processes established for the Bank s insured depository members. 
    
  The Bank determines the maximum amount and maximum term of the advances it will make to a CDFI based on an ongoing risk assessment that considers information from the CDFI s audited annual financial statements, supplemented by additional information deemed relevant by the Bank. Approved terms are designed to meet the

needs of the individual member while mitigating the unique credit and collateral risks of CDFIs, which do not file quarterly regulatory financial reports and are not subject to the same inspection and regulation requirements as the Bank s insured depository members. 
    
  The Bank determines the maximum amount and maximum term of the advances it will make to a housing associate based on an ongoing risk assessment that considers the housing associate s financial and regulatory standing and other qualitative information deemed relevant by the Bank. Approved terms are designed to meet the needs of the individual housing associate while mitigating the unique credit and collateral risks of housing associates, which do not file quarterly regulatory financial reports and are not subject to the same inspection and regulation requirements as the Bank s insured depository members. 
    
  Pursuant to the Bank s lending agreements with its borrowers, the Bank limits extensions of credit to individual borrowers to a percentage of the market value or unpaid principal balance of the borrower s pledged collateral, known as the borrowing capacity. The borrowing capacity percentage varies according to several factors, including the charter type of the institution, the collateral type, the value assigned to the collateral, the results of the Bank s collateral field review of the borrower s collateral, the pledging method used for loan collateral (specific identification or blanket lien), the amount of loan data provided (detailed or summary reporting), the data reporting frequency (monthly or quarterly), the borrower s financial strength and condition, and any institution-specific collateral risks. Under the terms of the Bank s lending agreements, the aggregate borrowing capacity of a borrower s pledged eligible collateral must meet or exceed the total amount of the borrower s outstanding advances, other extensions of credit, and certain other borrower obligations and liabilities. The Bank monitors each borrower s aggregate borrowing capacity and collateral requirements on a daily basis by comparing the institution s borrowing capacity to its obligations to the Bank.  
    
  In addition, the total amount of advances made available to each member or housing associate may be limited by the financing availability assigned by the Bank, which is generally expressed as a percentage of the member s or housing associate s assets. The amount of financing availability is generally determined by the creditworthiness of the member or housing associate. 
    
  When a nonmember financial institution acquires some or all of the assets and liabilities of a member, including outstanding advances and Bank capital stock, the Bank may allow the advances to remain outstanding, at its discretion. The nonmember borrower is required to meet the Bank s applicable credit, collateral, and capital stock requirements, including requirements regarding creditworthiness and collateral borrowing capacity.  
    
  The following tables present a summary of the status of the credit outstanding and overall collateral borrowing capacity of the Bank s member and nonmember borrowers as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s internal credit ratings stayed the same or improved for the majority of members and nonmember borrowers.

    Collateral borrowing capacity does not represent any commitment to lend on the part of the Bank. 
       
  Based on the collateral pledged as security for advances, the Bank s credit analyses of borrowers  financial condition, and the Bank s credit extension and collateral policies, the Bank expects to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the advances. Therefore, no allowance for credit losses on advances is deemed necessary by the Bank. The Bank has never experienced any credit losses on advances. 
    
  Securities pledged as collateral are assigned borrowing capacities that reflect the securities  pricing volatility and market liquidity risks. Securities are delivered to the Bank s custodian when they are pledged. The Bank prices securities collateral on a daily basis or twice a month, depending on the availability and reliability of external pricing sources. Securities that are normally priced twice a month may be priced more frequently in volatile market conditions. The Bank benchmarks the borrowing capacities for securities collateral to the market on a periodic basis and may review and change the borrowing capacity for any security type at any time. As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrowing capacities assigned to U.S. Treasury and agency securities ranged from   55% to 98%   of their market value. The borrowing capacities assigned to private-label MBS, which must be rated   AAA or AA   when initially pledged, generally ranged from   55% to 80%   of their market value, depending on the underlying collateral (residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, or commercial real estate loans), the rating, and the subordination structure of the respective securities.  
    
  The following table presents the securities collateral pledged by all members and by nonmembers with credit outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 

With respect to loan collateral, most borrowers may choose to pledge loan collateral by specific identification or under a blanket lien. Insurance companies, CDFIs, and housing associates are required to pledge loan collateral by specific identification with monthly reporting. All other borrowers pledging by specific identification must provide a detailed listing of all the loans pledged to the Bank on a monthly basis. With a blanket lien, a borrower generally pledges the following loan types, whether or not the individual loans are eligible to receive borrowing capacity: all  
  
   91 

Table of Contents  

loans secured by real estate; all loans made for commercial, corporate, or business purposes; and all participations in these loans. Borrowers pledging under a blanket lien may provide a detailed listing of loans or may use a summary reporting method.  
    
  The Bank may require certain borrowers to deliver pledged loan collateral to the Bank for one or more reasons, including the following: the borrower is a de novo institution (chartered within the last three years), an insurance company, a CDFI, or a housing associate; the Bank is concerned about the borrower s creditworthiness; or the Bank is concerned about the maintenance of its collateral or the priority of its security interest. With the exception of insurance companies, CDFIs, and housing associates, borrowers required to deliver loan collateral must pledge those loans under a blanket lien with detailed reporting. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , of the loan collateral pledged to the Bank,   29%   was pledged by   27   institutions by specific identification,   48%   was pledged by   127   institutions under a blanket lien with detailed reporting, and   23%   was pledged by   123   institutions under a blanket lien with summary reporting. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s maximum borrowing capacities as a percentage of the assigned market value of mortgage loan collateral pledged under a blanket lien with detailed reporting were as follows:   92%   for first lien residential mortgage loans,   91%   for multifamily mortgage loans,   88%   for commercial mortgage loans, and   82%   for second lien residential mortgage loans. The maximum borrowing capacity for small business, small agribusiness, and small farm loans was   50%   of the unpaid principal balance, although most of these loans are pledged under blanket lien with summary reporting, with a maximum borrowing capacity of 25%. The highest borrowing capacities are available to borrowers that pledge under a blanket lien with detailed reporting because the detailed loan information allows the Bank to assess the value of the collateral more precisely and because additional collateral is pledged under the blanket lien that may not receive borrowing capacity but may be liquidated to repay advances in the event of default. The Bank may review and change the maximum borrowing capacity for any type of loan collateral at any time.  
    
  The table below presents the mortgage loan collateral pledged by all members and by nonmembers with credit outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .   

(1) 
    The unpaid principal balance for loan participations is 100% of the outstanding loan amount. The borrowing capacity for loan participations is based on the participated amount pledged to the Bank. 
       
  The Bank holds a security interest in subprime residential mortgage loans pledged as collateral. Subprime loans are defined as loans with a borrower FICO score of 660 or less at origination, or if the original FICO score is not available, as loans with a current borrower FICO score of 660 or less. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the unpaid principal balance of these loans totaled   $10 billion   and   $13 billion  , respectively. The Bank reviews and assigns borrowing capacities to subprime mortgage loans as it does for all other types of loan collateral, taking  
  
   92 

Table of Contents  

into account the known credit attributes in the pricing of the loans. All advances, including those made to borrowers pledging subprime mortgage loans, are required to be fully collateralized. The Bank limits the amount of borrowing capacity that may be supported by subprime collateral. 

Investments.   The Bank has adopted credit policies and exposure limits for investments that promote risk limitation, diversification, and liquidity. These policies determine eligible counterparties and restrict the amounts and terms of the Bank s investments with any given counterparty according to the Bank s own capital position as well as the capital and creditworthiness of the counterparty.  
    
  The Bank monitors its investments for substantive changes in relevant market conditions and any declines in fair value. For securities in an unrealized loss position because of factors other than movements in interest rates, such as widening of mortgage asset spreads, the Bank considers whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security by comparing the best estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the Bank s best estimate of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, the difference is considered the credit loss. 
    
  When the fair value of an individual investment security falls below its amortized cost, the Bank evaluates whether the decline is other than temporary. The Bank recognizes an OTTI when it determines that it will be unable to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security and the fair value of the investment security is less than its amortized cost. The Bank considers its intent to hold the security and whether it is more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery of the remaining cost basis, and other factors. The Bank generally views changes in the fair value of the securities caused by movements in interest rates to be temporary.  
    
  The following tables present the Bank s investment credit exposure at the dates indicated, based on the lowest of the long-term credit ratings provided by Moody s, S P, or comparable Fitch Ratings (Fitch) ratings.

    Credit ratings of BB and lower are below investment grade. 
              (2) 
    The Bank has one security guaranteed by Fannie Mae but rated BB by Moody's because of extraordinary expenses incurred during bankruptcy of the security's sponsor. 
              (3) 
    Includes   $90 million   at   September 30, 2016  , in Federal funds sold to a member counterparty determined by the Bank to have an internal credit rating equivalent to an AA rating. 
       
  For all securities in its AFS and HTM portfolios, for Federal funds sold, and for securities purchased under agreements to resell, the Bank does not intend to sell any security and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell any security before its anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis. 
    
  The Bank invests in short-term unsecured interest-bearing deposits, short-term unsecured Federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and negotiable certificates of deposit with member and nonmember counterparties, all of which are highly rated.  
    
  The Bank actively monitors its credit exposures and the credit quality of its counterparties, including an assessment of each counterparty s financial performance, capital adequacy, likelihood of parental or sovereign support, and the current market perceptions of the counterparties. The Bank may also consider general macroeconomic and market conditions and political stability when establishing limits on unsecured investments with U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks. As a result of deteriorating financial condition or concerns about adverse economic or market developments, the Bank may reduce limits or terms on unsecured investments or suspend a counterparty. 
    
  Finance Agency regulations limit the amount of unsecured credit that an individual FHLBank may extend to a single counterparty. This limit is calculated with reference to a percentage of either the FHLBank s or the counterparty s capital and to the counterparty s overall credit rating. Under these regulations, the lesser of the  
  
   95 

Table of Contents  

FHLBank s total regulatory capital or the counterparty s Tier 1 capital is multiplied by a percentage specified in the regulation. The percentages used to determine the maximum amount of term extensions of unsecured credit range from 1% to 15%, depending on the counterparty s overall credit rating. Term extensions of unsecured credit include on-balance sheet transactions, off-balance sheet commitments, and derivative transactions, but exclude overnight Federal funds sales, even if subject to a continuing contract. (See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Risk Management   Derivative Counterparties  for additional information related to derivatives exposure.) 
    
  Finance Agency regulations also permit the FHLBanks to extend additional unsecured credit to the same single counterparty for overnight sales of Federal funds, even if subject to a continuing contract. However, an FHLBank s total unsecured credit to a single counterparty (total term plus additional overnight Federal funds unsecured credit) may not exceed twice the regulatory limit for term exposures (2% to 30% of the lesser of the FHLBank s total regulatory capital or the counterparty s Tier 1 capital, based on the counterparty s overall credit rating). In addition, the FHLBanks are prohibited by Finance Agency regulation from investing in financial instruments issued by non-U.S. entities other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks. 
    
  Under Finance Agency regulations, the total amount of unsecured credit that an FHLBank may extend to a group of affiliated counterparties for term extensions of unsecured credit and overnight Federal funds sales, combined, may not exceed 30% of the FHLBank s total capital. These limits on affiliated counterparty groups are in addition to the limits on extensions of unsecured credit applicable to any single counterparty within the affiliated group. 
    
   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s unsecured investment credit exposure to U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks was limited to Federal funds sold, which represented   85%   of the Bank s total unsecured investment credit exposure in Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits.  
    
  The following table presents the credit ratings of the unsecured investment credit exposures presented by the domicile of the counterparty or the domicile of the counterparty s parent for U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks, based on the lowest of the credit ratings provided by Moody s, S P, or comparable Fitch ratings. This table does not reflect the foreign sovereign government s credit rating. At   September 30, 2016  ,   26%   of the carrying value of unsecured investments held by the Bank were rated AA.

These ratings represent the lowest rating available for each unsecured investment owned by the Bank, based on the ratings provided by Moody s, S P, or comparable Fitch ratings. The Bank s internal rating may differ from this rating. 
              (3) 
    Includes   $90 million   at   September 30, 2016  , in Federal funds sold to a member counterparty determined by the Bank to have an internal credit rating equivalent to an AA rating. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of the Bank s unsecured investment had overnight maturities. 
    
  The Bank s investments may also include housing finance agency bonds issued by housing finance agencies located in Arizona, California, and Nevada, the three states that make up the Bank s district. These bonds are mortgage revenue bonds (federally taxable), are collateralized by pools of first lien residential mortgage loans, and are credit-enhanced by bond insurance. The bonds held by the Bank are issued by the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) and insured by either Ambac Assurance Corporation (Ambac), National Public Financial Guarantee (formerly MBIA Insurance Corporation), or Assured Guaranty Municipal Corporation (formerly Financial Security Assurance Incorporated). At   September 30, 2016  , all of the bonds were rated at least   A   by   Moody s or S P  .  
    
  For the Bank s investments in housing finance agency bonds, which were issued by CalHFA, the gross unrealized losses were mainly due to an illiquid market, credit concerns regarding the underlying mortgage collateral, and credit concerns regarding the monoline insurance providers, causing these investments to be valued at a discount to their acquisition cost. The Bank independently modeled cash flows for the underlying collateral, using assumptions for default rates and loss severity that a market participant would deem reasonable, and concluded that the available credit support within the CalHFA structure more than offset the projected underlying collateral losses. The Bank determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , all of the gross unrealized losses on the CalHFA bonds are temporary because the underlying collateral and credit enhancements were sufficient to protect the Bank from losses. As a result, the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. If conditions in the housing and mortgage markets and general business and economic conditions deteriorate, the fair value of the CalHFA bonds may decline further and the Bank may experience OTTI in future periods. 
    
  The Bank s MBS investments include PLRMBS, all of which were AAA-rated at the time of purchase, and  
  agency residential MBS, which are backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. Some of the PLRMBS were issued by and/or purchased from members, former members, or their affiliates. The Bank has investment credit limits and terms for these investments that do not differ for members and nonmembers. Regulatory policy limits total MBS investments to three times the Bank s capital at the time of purchase. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s MBS portfolio was   283%   of Bank capital (as determined in accordance with regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks). The Bank has not purchased any PLRMBS since the first quarter of 2008. 
    
  The Bank executes all MBS investments without preference to the status of the counterparty or the issuer of the investment as a nonmember, member, or affiliate of a member. When the Bank executes non-MBS investments with members, the Bank may give consideration to their secured credit availability and the Bank s advances price levels.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , PLRMBS representing   28%   of the amortized cost of the Bank s MBS portfolio were labeled Alt-A by the issuer. These PLRMBS are generally collateralized by mortgage loans that are considered less risky than subprime loans but more risky than prime loans. These loans are generally made to borrowers with credit scores that are high enough to qualify for a prime mortgage loan, but the loans may not meet standard underwriting guidelines for documentation requirements, property type, or loan-to-value ratios.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s investment in MBS had gross unrealized losses totaling   $188 million  , most of which were related to PLRMBS. These gross unrealized losses were primarily due to illiquidity in the MBS market and market expectations of the credit performance of loan collateral underlying these securities, which caused these assets to be valued at discounts to their amortized cost.  

97 

Table of Contents  

For its agency MBS, the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities because the Bank determined that the strength of the issuers  guarantees through direct obligations or support from the U.S. government is sufficient to protect the Bank from losses. As a result, the Bank determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , all of the gross unrealized losses on its agency MBS are temporary. 
    
  To assess whether it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of its PLRMBS, the Bank performed a cash flow analysis for all of its PLRMBS as of   September 30, 2016  , using two third-party models. The first model projects prepayments, default rates, and loss severities on the underlying collateral based on borrower characteristics and the particular attributes of the loans underlying the Bank s securities, in conjunction with assumptions related primarily to future changes in housing prices and interest rates.   A   significant input to the first model is the forecast of future housing price changes for the relevant states and core-based statistical areas (CBSAs), which are based on an assessment of the regional housing markets. CBSA refers collectively to metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. As currently defined, a CBSA must contain at least one urban area with a population of 10,000 or more people.  
    
  The month-by-month projections of future loan performance derived from the first model, which reflect projected prepayments, default rates, and loss severities, are then input into a second model that allocates the projected loan level cash flows and losses to the various security classes in each securitization structure in accordance with the structure s prescribed cash flow and loss allocation rules. When the credit enhancement for the senior securities in a securitization is derived from the presence of subordinated securities, losses are generally allocated first to the subordinated securities until their principal balance is reduced to zero. The projected cash flows are based on a number of assumptions and expectations, and the results of these models can vary significantly with changes in assumptions and expectations. The scenario of cash flows determined based on the model approach described above reflects a best-estimate scenario and includes a base case housing price forecast that reflects the expectations for near- and long-term housing price behavior. 
    
  The FHLBanks  OTTI Committee developed a short-term housing price forecast with projected changes ranging from a decrease of   1.0%   to an increase of   10.0%   over the 12-month period beginning   July 1, 2016  . For the vast majority of markets, the projected short-term housing price changes range from an increase of   3.0%   to an increase of   6.0%  . Thereafter, a unique path is projected for each geographic area based on an internally developed framework derived from historical data. 
    
  In addition to evaluating its PLRMBS under a base case (or best estimate) scenario, the Bank performed a cash flow analysis for each of these securities under a more adverse housing price scenario. This more adverse scenario was primarily based on a short-term housing price forecast that was five percentage points below the base case forecast, followed by a recovery path with annual rates of housing price growth that were 33.0% lower than the base case.  
    
  The following table shows the base case scenario and what the credit-related OTTI loss would have been under the more adverse housing price scenario at   September 30, 2016  :

  For the Bank s PLRMBS, the following table shows the amortized cost, estimated fair value, credit- and non-credit-related OTTI, performance of the underlying collateral based on the classification at the time of origination, and credit enhancement statistics by type of collateral and year of securitization. Credit enhancement is defined as the percentage of subordinated tranches and over-collateralization, if any, in a security structure that will absorb losses before the Bank will experience a loss on the security, expressed as a percentage of the underlying collateral balance. The credit enhancement figures include the additional credit enhancement required by the Bank (above the amounts required for an AAA rating by the credit rating agencies) for selected securities starting in late 2004, and for all securities starting in late 2005. The calculated weighted averages represent the dollar-weighted averages of all the PLRMBS in each category shown. The classification (prime or Alt-A) is based on the model used to run the estimated cash flows for the security, which may not necessarily be the same as the classification at the time of origination.

  The following table presents a summary of the significant inputs used to determine potential OTTI credit losses in the Bank s PLRMBS portfolio at   September 30, 2016  .

Credit enhancement is defined as the subordinated tranches and over-collateralization, if any, in a security structure that will generally absorb losses before the Bank will experience a loss on the security, expressed as a percentage of the underlying collateral balance. The calculated averages represent the dollar-weighted averages of all the PLRMBS investments in each category shown. The classification (prime or Alt-A) is based on the model used to run the estimated cash flows for the security, which may not necessarily be the same as the classification at the time of origination.  
    
  The following table presents the fair value of the Bank s PLRMBS as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance by collateral type at origination and year of securitization.

Table of Contents  

The Bank determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the gross unrealized losses on the PLRMBS that have not had an OTTI loss are primarily due to illiquidity in the PLRMBS market and market expectations of the credit performance of loan collateral underlying these securities, which caused these assets to be valued at discounts to their amortized cost. The Bank does not intend to sell these securities, it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell these securities before its anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis, and the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. As a result, the Bank determined that, as of   September 30, 2016  , all of the gross unrealized losses on these securities are temporary. The Bank will continue to monitor and analyze the performance of these securities to assess the likelihood of the recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of these securities as of each balance sheet date. 
    
  If conditions in the housing and mortgage markets and general business and economic conditions deteriorate, the fair value of MBS may decline further and the Bank may experience OTTI of additional PLRMBS in future periods, as well as further impairment of PLRMBS that were identified as other-than-temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016  . Additional future credit-related OTTI losses could adversely affect the Bank s earnings and retained earnings and its ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock. The Bank cannot predict whether it will be required to record additional credit-related OTTI losses on its PLRMBS in the future. 

Derivative Counterparties.   The Bank has also adopted credit policies and exposure limits for uncleared derivatives credit exposure. Over-the-counter derivatives may be either entered into directly with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or executed either with an executing dealer or on a swap execution facility and then cleared through a futures commission merchant (clearing agent) with a derivatives clearing organization (cleared derivatives). 
    
  Uncleared Derivatives.   The Bank selects only highly rated derivative dealers and major banks (derivative dealer counterparties) that meet the Bank s eligibility criteria to act as counterparties for its uncleared derivative activities. In addition, the Bank has entered into master netting agreements and bilateral credit support agreements with all active derivative dealer counterparties that provide for delivery of collateral at specified levels to limit the Bank s  
  
   103 

Table of Contents  

net unsecured credit exposure to these counterparties. Under these policies and agreements, the amount of unsecured credit exposure to an individual derivative dealer counterparty is either (i) limited to an absolute dollar credit exposure according to the counterparty s long-term debt or deposit credit rating, as determined by the rating agencies, or (ii) set at zero (subject to a minimum transfer amount). All credit exposure from derivative transactions entered into by the Bank with member counterparties that are not derivative dealers (including interest rate swaps, caps, and floors), for which the Bank serves as an intermediary, must be fully secured by eligible collateral, and all such derivative transactions are subject to both the Bank s Advances and Security Agreement and a master netting agreement. 
    
  The Bank is subject to the risk of potential nonperformance by the counterparties to derivative agreements. Unless the collateral delivery threshold is set at zero, the amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. A counterparty generally must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank s exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. Currently, all of the Bank s active uncleared derivative counterparties have a zero threshold. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivative transactions with counterparties as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Cleared Derivatives.   The Bank is subject to nonperformance by the derivatives clearing organizations (clearinghouses) and clearing agents. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. However, the use of cleared derivatives mitigates the Bank s overall credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and variation margin is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The following table presents the Bank s credit exposure to its derivative dealer counterparties at the dates indicated.

  The increase or decrease in the credit exposure net of cash collateral, from one period to the next, may be affected by changes in several variables, such as the size and composition of the portfolio, market values of derivatives, and accrued interest. 
    
  Based on the master netting arrangements, its credit analyses, and the collateral requirements in place with each counterparty, the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on its derivative agreements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, if applicable, and the reported amounts of income, expenses, gains, and losses during the reporting period. Changes in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions could potentially affect the Bank s financial position and results of operations significantly. Although the Bank believes these judgments, estimates, and assumptions to be reasonably accurate, actual results may differ. 
    
  In the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K, the following accounting policies and estimates were identified as critical because they require the Bank to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies and estimates are: estimating the allowance for credit losses on the advances and mortgage loan portfolios; accounting for derivatives; estimating fair values of investments classified as trading and AFS, derivatives and associated hedged items carried at fair value in accordance with the accounting for derivative instruments and associated hedging activities, and financial instruments carried at fair value under the fair value option; accounting for OTTI for investment securities; and estimating the prepayment speeds on MBS and mortgage loans for the accounting of amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on MBS and mortgage loans.

Recent Developments  
    
  FHLBank Membership for Non-Federally-Insured Credit Unions.     On September 28, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed amendments to regulations governing FHLBank membership that would implement statutory amendments to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (the  Bank Act ) authorizing FHLBanks to accept applications for membership from state-chartered credit unions without federal share insurance, provided that certain prerequisites have been met. The new rule, if adopted, would generally treat these credit unions the same as other depository institutions with an additional requirement that they obtain an affirmative statement from their state regulator that they meet the requirements for federal insurance as of the date of their application for FHLBank membership; a written statement from the state regulator that it cannot or will not make any determination regarding eligibility for federal insurance;  or if the regulator fails or refuses to respond to the credit union s request within six months, confirmation of the failure to receive a response.

Comments are due on the proposed rule by November 28, 2016. The Bank is currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but does not anticipate that, if adopted, it would materially affect the Bank.  
  Indemnification Payments.     On September 20, 2016, the Finance Agency issued a re-proposed rule that, if adopted, would establish standards for identifying whether an indemnification payment by an FHLBank or the OF to an officer, director, employee, or other entity-affiliated party in connection with an administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the Finance Agency is prohibited or permissible. Under the proposed rule, those payments with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the Finance Agency are only permitted if they relate to: 

premiums for professional liability insurance or fidelity bonds for directors and officers, to the extent that the insurance or fidelity bond covers expenses and restitution, but not a judgment in favor of the Finance Agency or a civil money penalty; 
                
    expenses of defending an action, subject to an agreement to repay those expenses in certain instances; and 
                
    amounts due under an indemnification agreement entered into on or prior to September 20, 2016.  
       
  The proposed rule also outlines the process a board of directors must undertake prior to making any permitted indemnification payment for expenses of defending an action initiated by the Finance Agency. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by December 21, 2016. The Bank is currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but does not anticipate that, if adopted, it would materially affect the Bank. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees, and Other Commitments 
    
  In accordance with regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks, each FHLBank, including the Bank, is jointly and severally liable for the FHLBank System s consolidated obligations issued under Section 11(a) of the FHLBank Act, and in accordance with the FHLBank Act, each FHLBank, including the Bank, is jointly and severally liable for consolidated obligations issued under Section 11(c) of the FHLBank Act. The joint and several liability regulation authorizes the Finance Agency to require any FHLBank to repay all or a portion of the principal or interest on consolidated obligations for which another FHLBank is the primary obligor.  
    
  The Bank determined that it was not necessary to recognize a liability for the fair value of the Bank's joint and 
  several liability for all consolidated obligations. The joint and several obligations are mandated by the FHLBank 
  Act or regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks and are not the result of arms-length transactions 
  among the FHLBanks. The FHLBanks have no control over the amount of the guarantee or the determination of 
  how each FHLBank would perform under the joint and several obligations. Because the FHLBanks are subject to 
  the authority of the Finance Agency as it relates to decisions involving the allocation of the joint and several 
  liability for the FHLBanks' consolidated obligations, the FHLBanks' joint and several obligations are excluded from 
  the initial recognition and measurement provisions. Accordingly, the Bank has not recognized a liability for its joint 
  and several obligations related to other FHLBanks' participations in the consolidated obligations. The par value of the outstanding consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks was   $967.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $905.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The par value of the Bank s participation in consolidated obligations was   $88.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and   $79.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The Bank had committed to the issuance of   $1.1 billion   and $410 million in consolidated obligations at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Bank engages in financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are not recorded on the Bank s balance sheet or may be recorded on the Bank s balance sheet in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transactions. For example, the Bank routinely enters into commitments to extend advances and issues standby letters of credit. These commitments and standby letters of credit may represent future cash requirements of the Bank, although the standby letters of credit usually expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting and collateral requirements as advances made by the Bank. At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had   $361 million   in  
  
   107 

Table of Contents  

advance commitments and   $16.4 billion   in standby letters of credit outstanding. At   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had   $10 million   in advance commitments and   $12.3 billion   in standby letters of credit outstanding.  
    
  For additional information, see    Item 1. Financial Statements       Note 17   Commitments and Contingencies  .  

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
    
  Market risk is defined as the risk to the Bank's market value of capital and future earnings (excluding the impact of any cumulative net gains or losses on derivatives and associated hedged items and on financial instruments carried at fair value) as a result of movements in market interest rates, interest rate spreads, interest rate volatility, and other market factors (market rate factors). This profile reflects the Bank s objective of maintaining a conservative asset-liability mix and its commitment to providing value to its members through products and dividends without subjecting their investments in Bank capital stock to significant market risk.  
    
  The Bank s Risk Management Policy includes a market risk management objective aimed at maintaining a relatively low adverse exposure of the market value of capital and future earnings (excluding the impact of any cumulative net gains or losses on derivatives and associated hedged items and on financial instruments carried at fair value) to changes in market rate factors. See  Total Bank Market Risk  below. 
    
  Market risk identification and measurement are primarily accomplished through market value of capital sensitivity analyses and projected earnings and adjusted return on capital sensitivity analyses. The Risk Management Policy approved by the Bank s Board of Directors establishes market risk policy limits and market risk measurement standards at the total Bank level as well as at the business segment level. Additional guidelines approved by the Bank s Enterprise Risk Committee apply to the Bank s two business segments, the advances-related business and the mortgage-related business. These guidelines provide limits that are monitored at the segment level and are consistent with the Bank s policy limits. Market risk is managed for each business segment on a daily basis, as discussed below in  Segment Market Risk.  Compliance with Bank policies and guidelines is reviewed by the Bank s Board of Directors on a regular basis, along with a corrective action plan if applicable. 
    
  Total Bank Market Risk  
    
  Market Value of Capital Sensitivity 
    
  The Bank uses market value of capital sensitivity (the interest rate sensitivity of the net fair value of all assets, liabilities, and interest rate exchange agreements) as an important measure of the Bank s exposure to changes in interest rates. As presented below, the Bank no longer measures, monitors, or reports on the net portfolio value of capital sensitivity analysis. 
    
  In March 2016, the Board of Directors approved a modification to the Bank s Risk Management Policy to discontinue the use of the net portfolio value of capital sensitivity as the primary metric for measuring the Bank s exposure to changes in interest rates and to eliminate the policy limit on the net portfolio value of capital sensitivity. Effective with the March 31, 2016, measurement, the Bank has reverted to the market value of capital sensitivity as the Bank s market risk metric of record. The Bank adopted the net portfolio value of capital sensitivity as the market risk metric in early 2008 because of the large valuation spreads implied by the market prices (which included large liquidity discounts) on the Bank s private-label residential mortgage-backed securities (PLRMBS). The large valuation spreads resulted in a disconnect between the measured and the actual market sensitivity risks faced by the Bank as a buy and hold investor. The net portfolio value methodology used valuation methods that estimated the value of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and mortgage loans in alternative interest rate environments based on valuation spreads that existed at the time the Bank acquired the MBS and mortgage loans (acquisition spreads), rather than valuation spreads implied by the current market prices of MBS and mortgage loans. During periods of depressed mortgage asset prices, risk metrics based on spreads existing at the time of acquisition of mortgage assets better reflect the sensitivities in the level and timing of cash flows the Bank faces. Improved liquidity in the MBS markets and the resulting improvement in prices have resulted in the convergence of risk measurements based on  
  
   108 

Table of Contents  

the two methodologies. Risk metrics based on acquisition spreads are no longer required. Measuring market value risk based on current market prices rather than valuation spreads at time of acquisition is a more straightforward way of measuring market risk and is appropriate given current and anticipated MBS and mortgage market conditions. 
    
  The Bank s market value of capital sensitivity policy limits the potential adverse impact of an instantaneous parallel shift of a plus or minus 100-basis-point change in interest rates from current rates (base case) to no worse than    4.0% of the estimated market value of capital  . In addition, the policy limits the potential adverse impact of an instantaneous plus or minus 100-basis-point change in interest rates measured from interest rates that are 200 basis points above or below the base case to no worse than    6.0% of the estimated market value of capital  . In the case where a market risk sensitivity compliance metric cannot be estimated with a parallel shift in interest rates because of prevailing low interest rates, the sensitivity metric is not reported. The Bank s measured market value of capital sensitivity was   within the policy limits   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  To determine the Bank s estimated risk sensitivities to interest rates for the market value of capital sensitivity, the Bank uses a third-party proprietary asset and liability system to calculate estimated market values under alternative interest rate scenarios. The system analyzes all of the Bank s financial instruments, including derivatives, on a transaction-level basis using sophisticated valuation models with consistent and appropriate behavioral assumptions and current position data. The system also includes a third-party mortgage prepayment model.  
    
  At least annually, the Bank reexamines the major assumptions and methodologies used in the model, including interest rate curves, spreads for discounting, and mortgage prepayment assumptions. The Bank also compares the mortgage prepayment assumptions in the third-party model to other sources, including actual mortgage prepayment history. 
    
  The table below presents the sensitivity of the market value of capital (the market value of all of the Bank s assets, liabilities, and associated interest rate exchange agreements, with mortgage assets valued using market spreads implied by current market prices) to changes in interest rates. The table presents the estimated percentage change in the Bank s market value of capital that would be expected to result from changes in interest rates under different interest rate scenarios, using market spread assumptions.  

(1) 
    Instantaneous change from actual rates at dates indicated. 
              (2)   
    Interest rates for each maturity are limited to non-negative interest rates. 
       
  The Bank s estimates of the sensitivity of the market value of capital to changes in interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , show lower adverse sensitivity in rising rate scenarios and lower favorable sensitivity in the declining 200-basis-point rate change scenario compared to the estimates as of December 31, 2015. The primary factor contributing to the change in the sensitivity profile is the impact associated with lower intermediate- and long-term interest rates. LIBOR interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , were   9   basis points higher for the 1-year term,   55   basis points lower for the 5-year term, and   73   basis points lower for the 10-year term. Because interest rates in the declining rate scenarios are limited to non-negative interest rates and the current interest rate environment is so low, the interest rates in the declining rate scenarios cannot decrease to the same extent that the interest rates in the rising rate scenarios can increase.

The Bank's Risk Management Policy provides guidelines for the payment of dividends and the repurchase of excess capital stock based on the ratio of the Bank's estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock. If this ratio at the end of any quarter is: (i) less than 100% but greater than or equal to 90%, any dividend would be limited to an annualized rate no greater than the daily average of the three-month LIBOR for the applicable quarter (subject to certain conditions), and any excess capital stock repurchases would not exceed $500 million (subject to certain conditions); (ii) less than 90% but greater than or equal to 70%, any dividend and any excess capital stock repurchases would be subject to the same limitations and conditions as in (i) above, except that any excess capital stock repurchases would not exceed 4% of the Bank's outstanding capital stock as of the repurchase date; and (iii) less than 70%, the Bank would not pay a dividend, not repurchase excess capital stock (but continue to redeem excess capital stock as provided in the Bank's Capital Plan), limit the acquisition of certain assets, and review the Bank's risk policies. A decision by the Board of Directors to declare or not declare any dividend or repurchase any excess capital stock is a discretionary matter and is subject to the requirements and restrictions of the FHLBank Act and applicable requirements under the regulations governing the operations of the FHLBanks. The ratio of the Bank's estimated market value of total capital to par value of capital stock was   214%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Adjusted Return on Capital     The adjusted return on capital is a measure used by the Bank to assess financial performance. The adjusted return on capital is based on current period economic earnings that exclude the effects of unrealized net gains or losses resulting from the Bank s derivatives and associated hedged items and from financial instruments carried at fair value, which will generally reverse through changes in future valuations and settlements of contractual interest cash flows over the remaining contractual terms to maturity or by the call or put date of the assets and liabilities held under the fair value option, hedged assets and liabilities, and derivatives.     Economic earnings also exclude the interest expense on mandatorily redeemable capital stock and the 20% of net income allocated to the Bank s restricted retained earnings account in accordance with the FHLBanks  JCE Agreement. Economic earnings exclude these amounts in order to more accurately reflect the amount of earnings that may be available to be paid as dividends to shareholders. 
    
  The Bank limits the sensitivity of projected financial performance through a Board of Directors policy limit on projected adverse changes in the adjusted return on capital. The Bank s adjusted return on capital sensitivity policy limits the potential adverse impact of an instantaneous parallel shift of a plus or minus 200-basis-point change in interest rates from current rates (base case) to no worse than    120 basis points   from the base case projected adjusted return on capital. With the indicated interest rate shifts, the adjusted return on capital for the projected 12-month horizon would be expected to decrease by 14 basis points, well within the policy limit of    120 basis points  .  
    
  Duration Gap     Duration gap is the difference between the estimated durations (market value sensitivity) of assets and liabilities (including the impact of interest rate exchange agreements) and reflects the extent to which estimated maturity and repricing cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched. The Bank monitors duration gap analysis at the total Bank level and does not have a policy limit. The Bank s duration gap was   one   month at   September 30, 2016  , and   one month   at   December 31, 2015  . 

(1) 
    Duration gap values include the impact of interest rate exchange agreements. 
              (2)   
    Because of the current low interest rate environment, the duration gap is estimated using an instantaneous, one-sided parallel change upward of 100 basis points from base case interest rates.

Segment Market Risk  . The financial performance and interest rate risks of each business segment are managed within prescribed guidelines and policy limits.  
    
  Advances-Related Business     Interest rate risk arises from the advances-related business primarily through the use of shareholder-contributed capital and retained earnings to fund fixed rate investments of targeted amounts and maturities. In general, advances result in very little net interest rate risk for the Bank because most fixed rate advances with original maturities greater than three months and all advances with embedded options are simultaneously hedged with an interest rate swap or option with terms offsetting the advance. The interest rate swap or option generally is maintained as a hedge for the life of the advance. These hedged advances effectively create a pool of variable rate assets, which, in combination with the strategy of raising debt swapped to variable rate liabilities, creates an advances portfolio with low net interest rate risk. 
    
  Money market investments used for liquidity management generally have maturities of one month or less. In addition, the Bank invests in non-MBS agency securities, generally with terms of less than three years. These investments may be variable rate or fixed rate, and the interest rate risk resulting from the fixed rate coupon is hedged with an interest rate swap or fixed rate debt. 
    
  The interest rate risk in the advances-related business is primarily associated with the Bank s strategy for investing capital (capital stock, including mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and retained earnings). The Bank s strategy is generally to invest 50% of capital in short-term investments (maturities of three months or less) and 50% in intermediate-term investments (a laddered portfolio of investments with maturities of up to four years). However, this strategy may be altered from time to time depending on market conditions. The strategy to invest 50% of capital in short-term assets is intended to mitigate the market value of capital risks associated with the potential repurchase or redemption of excess capital stock. Excess capital stock usually results from a decline in a borrower s outstanding advances or by a membership termination. Under the Bank s capital plan, capital stock, when repurchased or redeemed, is required to be repurchased or redeemed at its par value of $100 per share, subject to certain regulatory and statutory limits. The strategy to invest 50% of capital in a laddered portfolio of investments with short to intermediate maturities is intended to take advantage of the higher earnings available from a generally positively sloped yield curve, when intermediate-term investments generally have higher yields than short-term investments. 
    
  The Bank updates the repricing and maturity gaps for actual asset, liability, and derivative transactions that occur in the advances-related segment each day. The Bank regularly compares the targeted repricing and maturity gaps to the actual repricing and maturity gaps to identify rebalancing needs for the targeted gaps. On a weekly basis, the Bank evaluates the projected impact of expected maturities and scheduled repricings of assets, liabilities, and interest rate exchange agreements on the interest rate risk of the advances-related segment. The analyses are prepared under base case and alternate interest rate scenarios to assess the effect of options embedded in the advances, related financing, and hedges. These analyses are also used to measure and manage potential reinvestment risk (when the remaining term of advances is shorter than the remaining term of the financing) and potential refinancing risk (when the remaining term of advances is longer than the remaining term of the financing). 
    
  Because of the short-term and variable rate nature of the assets, liabilities, and derivatives of the advances-related business, the Bank s interest rate risk guidelines address the amounts of net assets that are expected to mature or reprice in a given period. The market value sensitivity analyses and net interest income simulations are also used to identify and measure risk and variances to the target interest rate risk exposure in the advances-related segment. 
    
  Mortgage-Related Business       The Bank s mortgage assets include MBS, most of which are classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) or available-for-sale (AFS), with a small amount classified as trading, and mortgage loans held for portfolio purchased under the MPF Program. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk from the mortgage-related business because the principal cash flows of the mortgage assets and the liabilities that fund them are not exactly matched through time and across all possible interest rate scenarios, given the impact of mortgage prepayments and the existence of interest rate caps on certain adjustable rate MBS. 

111 

Table of Contents  

The Bank purchases a mix of intermediate-term fixed rate and adjustable rate MBS. Generally, purchases of long-term fixed rate MBS have been relatively limited. Any MPF loans that have been acquired are medium- or long-term fixed rate mortgage assets. This results in a mortgage portfolio that has a diversified set of interest rate risk attributes. 
    
  The estimated market risk of the mortgage-related business is managed both at the time an asset is purchased and on an ongoing basis for the total portfolio. At the time of purchase (for all significant mortgage asset acquisitions), the Bank analyzes the estimated earnings sensitivity and estimated market value sensitivity, taking into consideration the estimated mortgage prepayment sensitivity of the mortgage assets and anticipated funding and hedging activities under various interest rate scenarios. The related funding and hedging transactions are executed at or close to the time of purchase of a mortgage asset.  
    
  At least monthly, the Bank reviews the estimated market risk profile of the entire portfolio of mortgage assets and related funding and hedging transactions. The Bank then considers rebalancing strategies to modify the estimated mortgage portfolio market risk profile. Periodically, the Bank performs more in-depth analyses, which include an analysis of the impacts of non-parallel shifts in the yield curve and assessments of the impacts of unanticipated mortgage prepayment behavior. Based on these analyses, the Bank may take actions to rebalance the mortgage portfolio s market risk profile. These rebalancing strategies may include entering into new funding and hedging transactions, forgoing or modifying certain funding or hedging transactions normally executed with new mortgage purchases, or terminating certain funding and hedging transactions for the mortgage asset portfolio.  
    
  The Bank manages the estimated interest rate risk associated with mortgage assets, including mortgage prepayment risk, through a combination of debt issuance and derivatives. The Bank may obtain funding through callable and non-callable FHLBank System debt and may execute derivative transactions to achieve principal cash flow patterns and market value sensitivities for the liabilities and derivatives that provide a significant offset to the interest rate and mortgage prepayment risks associated with the mortgage assets. Debt issued to finance mortgage assets may be fixed rate debt, callable fixed rate debt, or adjustable rate debt. Derivatives may be used as temporary hedges of anticipated debt issuance or long-term hedges of debt used to finance the mortgage assets. The derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk of fixed rate mortgage assets generally may be callable and non-callable pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Derivatives may also be used to offset the interest rate cap risk embedded in adjustable rate MBS. 
    
  As discussed above in  Total Bank Market Risk       Market Value of Capital Sensitivity  the Bank uses market value of capital sensitivity as a primary market value metric for measuring the Bank s exposure to interest rates. The Bank s interest rate risk policies and guidelines for the mortgage-related business address the market value of capital sensitivity of the assets, liabilities, and derivatives of the mortgage-related business. 
    
  The following table presents results of the estimated market value of capital sensitivity analysis attributable to the mortgage-related business as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 

(1) 
    Instantaneous change from actual rates at dates indicated.

For the mortgage-related business, the Bank s estimates of the sensitivity of the market value of capital to changes in interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , show lower adverse sensitivity in rising rate scenarios and lower favorable sensitivity in the declining 200-basis-point rate change scenario compared to the estimates as of December 31, 2015. The primary factor contributing to the change in the sensitivity profile is the impact associated with lower intermediate- and long-term interest rates. LIBOR interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , were   9   basis points higher for the 1-year term,   55   basis points lower for the 5-year term, and   73   basis points lower for the 10-year term. Because interest rates in the declining rate scenarios are limited to non-negative interest rates and the current interest rate environment is so low, the interest rates in the declining rate scenarios cannot decrease to the same extent that the interest rates in the rising rate scenarios can increase.  

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
       
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The senior management of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (Bank) is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Bank s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to the Bank s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures, the Bank s management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and the Bank s management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of controls and procedures. 
    
  Management of the Bank has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures with the participation of the president and chief executive officer, executive vice president and chief operating officer, and senior vice president and chief financial officer as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Bank s president and chief executive officer, executive vice president and chief operating officer, and senior vice president and chief financial officer have concluded that the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in the Bank s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank s internal control over financial reporting.  
    
  Consolidated Obligations 
    
  The Bank s disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures for accumulating and communicating information in compliance with the Bank s disclosure and financial reporting requirements relating to the joint and several liability for the consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks). Because the FHLBanks are independently managed and operated, the Bank s management relies on information that is provided or disseminated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency), the Office of Finance, and the other FHLBanks, as well as on published FHLBank credit ratings, in determining whether the joint and several liability regulation is reasonably likely to result in a direct obligation for the Bank or whether it is reasonably possible that the Bank will accrue a direct liability. 
    
  The Bank s management also relies on the operation of the joint and several liability regulation. The joint and several liability regulation requires that each FHLBank file with the Finance Agency a quarterly certification that it will remain capable of making full and timely payment of all of its current obligations, including direct obligations, coming due during the next quarter. In addition, if an FHLBank cannot make such a certification or if it projects that it may be unable to meet its current obligations during the next quarter on a timely basis, it must file a notice with  
  
   113

the Finance Agency. Under the joint and several liability regulation, the Finance Agency may order any FHLBank to make principal and interest payments on any consolidated obligations of any other FHLBank, or allocate the outstanding liability of an FHLBank among all remaining FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank s participation in all consolidated obligations outstanding or on any other basis.

Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent compliance with, or the exercise of, Executive s rights under applicable laws.  
  B.      Nonsolicitation  .  While Executive is employed by the Bank and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Bank, directly or indirectly, on Executive s own account or on behalf of or with any other person, as an employee, agent, consultant, partner, joint venturer, owner, officer, director, member of any other firm, partnership, corporation or other entity, or in any other capacity, personally or through others: (a) use Confidential Information to solicit, induce (or attempt to induce) or cause any client or customer that has transactions or assignments pending with the Bank to discontinue or reduce their transactions or assignments with the Bank, or otherwise breach or materially disrupt a contractual relationship between the Bank and any client, customer or vendor of the Bank; or (b) solicit, induce or encourage or attempt to solicit, induce or encourage (on Executive s own behalf or on behalf of others) any individual who at the time is an employee or consultant of the Bank to leave his or her employment or service relationship with the Bank or to commence employment or a service relationship with any other party.  It is not a violation of this Agreement for Executive, following Termination, to seek from a Bank client or customer transactions or assignments that are not pending with the Bank at the time of Termination. For purposes of this paragraph, (a) the use of general non-targeted employment advertising shall not be deemed to be solicitation and (b) the foregoing restrictions on solicitation shall only apply to employees of the Bank at the time of such solicitation.  
  C.      Noncompetition  .  Executive hereby covenants that he will not, during his employment with the Bank, directly or indirectly, in any capacity, engage or participate in, or become employed by or render advisory or consulting or other services that might create a conflict of interest with the Bank (it being acknowledged that service on civic or charitable boards or committees, service on no more than two (2) for-profit company boards, and delivering lectures and fulfilling speaking engagements, as set forth in Section 1, shall not be deemed to violate this section). 
  D.      Work Product  .  Any client or customer lists, prospective client or customer lists, plans, strategies, methodologies, secrets, processes, forecasts, ideas, developments, writings, designs, documents, papers, notes, notebooks, memoranda, computer files, software and other written or electronic records or confidential proprietary information of 

any kind made or developed in whole or in part by Executive during his employment with the Bank (the  Work Product ) are, and shall remain, the exclusive property of the Bank.  To the extent that any of the Work Product is capable of protection by copyright, Executive acknowledges that it is created within the scope of his employment hereunder and is a  work made for hire.   Previously held knowledge, plans, contacts or other intellectual property by Executive that pre-date him rendering services to the Bank are excluded from this provision and shall be disclosed in writing to the Bank on or prior to the Effective Date. 
  E.      Non-Disparagement  .  Executive hereby covenants that during his employment and for three (3) years after Termination, he will not make any remarks disparaging the conduct or character of the Bank, its members or employees, except as required by law.  Nothing in this  Agreement prohibits Executive from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation.  Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent compliance with, or the exercise of, Executive s rights under applicable laws. 
  F.      Cooperation  .  Executive hereby covenants that at any time after Termination of his employment with the Bank, Executive will cooperate with the Bank to the extent reasonably necessary to assist in the transition of his responsibilities and in any litigation or administrative proceedings involving any matters with which Executive was involved during his employment.  The Bank will reimburse Executive for reasonable expenses, if any, incurred in providing such assistance. 
  G.      Provisional and Equitable Remedies  .  If Executive should default in any of his obligations under this   Section 6  , Executive acknowledges that the Bank may be irreparably damaged and that it would be extremely difficult and impractical to measure such damage.  Accordingly, Executive acknowledges that the Bank, in addition to any other available rights or remedies, shall be entitled to specific performance, injunctive relief and any other equitable remedy, without the obligation to post any bond or other security.  Employee hereby waives the defense that a remedy at law or damages is adequate.

  (ii)    Severance pay in an amount equal to the sum of: 
  a.    two (2) times Executive's Base Salary, without giving effect to any reductions thereto which constitute Good Reason, paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable but in any event no later than sixty (60) calendar days following CICA Severance Termination (or, in the event the CICA Severance Termination precedes the consummation of a Change in Control and payment is not administratively practicable by the 

foregoing date because it is not yet known whether the Change in Control will occur within ninety (90) calendar days following the date of termination, such amount shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable but in any event no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the consummation of the Change in Control); plus 
  b.    an amount equal to two (2) times the Annual Incentive Amount, defined below, payable in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable but in any event no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the CICA Severance Termination (or, if the CICA Severance Termination precedes the consummation of a Change in Control and payment is not administratively practicable by the foregoing date because it is not yet known whether a Change in Control will occur within ninety (90) calendar days following the date of termination, such amounts shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable but in any event no later than sixty (60) calendar days following the consummation of the Change in Control).  For purposes of this Agreement,  Annual Incentive Amount  is defined as (i) an amount equal to the average of the aggregate annual short-term incentive amounts earned by Executive pursuant to the President s Incentive Plan in respect of the three (3) consecutive calendar years ending on the December 31 last preceding the date of the CICA Severance Termination, or such lesser number of consecutive calendar years as Executive has been employed by the Bank following the Effective Date and (ii) an amount equal to the average of the aggregate long-term incentive amounts earned by Executive pursuant to the EPUP in respect of the three (3) consecutive calendar years ending on the December 31 last preceding the date of the CICA Severance Termination, or such lesser number of consecutive calendar years as Executive has be employed by the Bank following the Effective Date.  For purposes of determining Executive s Annual Incentive Amount, (i) if Executive received no annual short-term incentive amounts in respect of a calendar year due to a failure to meet applicable performance objectives, such calendar year will nevertheless be taken into account (using Zero (0) as the applicable amount) in calculating Executive s Annual Incentive Amount, and (ii) if Executive was employed during a portion of a calendar year only and received a prorated short-term annual incentive amount taking into account his or her employment for only a portion of the year, the amount so received shall be annualized for purposes of calculating Executive s Annual Incentive Amount.  If any portion of the short-term annual incentive amount or long-term incentive amount earned by Executive consisted of securities or other property, the value of that portion of the incentive for purposes of this Agreement shall be the fair market value thereof determined in good faith by the Board.  For the period beginning on the date of CICA Severance Termination and ending on the one hundred eightieth (180th) calendar day following the first anniversary of the date of termination (or, if earlier, the date on which Executive accepts employment with another employer that provides comparable benefits in terms of cost and scope of coverage), the Bank shall pay for and provide Executive and his or her dependents with healthcare and life insurance benefits which are substantially the same as the benefits provided to Executive immediately prior to the date of termination; provided that Executive's right to continued healthcare and life insurance benefits following his Termination will terminate on the date on which Executive accepts employment with another employer that provides comparable benefits in terms of cost and scope of coverage.  Executive acknowledges that such healthcare benefit continuation is intended, and shall be deemed, to satisfy any applicable obligations of the Bank under Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any corresponding provisions of any applicable state law for such period and that the Bank may satisfy such obligation by paying any applicable premiums; and 

(iii)    executive-level outplacement services at the Bank's expense, not to exceed $25,000 provided by a firm selected by Executive from a list compiled by the Bank. 
    In the event of a CICA Severance Termination, Executive s sole remedy shall be to receive the payments and benefits described in this   Section 8.F  , and except as otherwise expressly required by law or as specifically provided herein, all of the Executive s other rights to salary, severance, benefits, bonuses and other amounts (if any) accruing on account of the termination of Executive's employment shall cease upon the CICA Severance Termination.  
  G.      Parachute Payments  . 
  (i)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent Executive would be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code on the payment made under   Section 8.F   hereof and any other payments or benefits Executive would receive from the Bank and its affiliates required to be included in the calculation of parachute payments for purposes of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, the amount payable under this Agreement shall be automatically reduced to an amount ten dollars ($10.00) less than the lowest amount which, when combined with such other amounts and benefits required to be so included, would subject Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code;   provided, however,   that payments made under this Agreement shall be so reduced only if the reduced amount received by Executive would be greater than the unreduced amount to be received by Executive less the excise tax payable under Section 4999 of the Code on such amount and the other amounts and benefits received by Executive and required to be included in the calculation of a parachute payment for purposes of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  In addition, Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive is not entitled to any reimbursement by the Bank for any taxes payable by Executive as a result of the payments and benefits received by Executive pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code. 
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any payments made to Executive pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with 12 U.S.C.   4518(e) and any regulations promulgated thereunder, including 12 C.F.R. Part 1231. 
  H.      No Mitigation  .  Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in   Sections 8.E or 8.F   by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this   Section 8   be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as the result of employment by another employer or self-employment or by retirement benefits; provided, however, that loans, advances or other amounts owed by Executive to the Bank may be offset by the Bank against amounts payable to Executive under this   Section 8  . 
  I.      Senior Corporate Officer Severance Policy  .  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event Executive receives any severance benefits pursuant to the Bank's Senior Corporate Officer Severance Policy, or any other  

severance policy or plan now or hereafter maintained by the Bank, the amount of the severance benefits payable pursuant to   Section 8   of this Agreement shall be automatically reduced by the benefits and payments received by Executive pursuant to such Senior Corporate Officer Severance Policy or other plan or policy. 
  J.      Release  .  As a condition to the Executive's receipt of any post-termination benefits described in   Section 8  , Executive shall execute a Release (the "Release") in a form reasonably acceptable to the Bank within fifty (50) calendar days following the Termination and shall not subsequently revoke such Release within the time as may be specified therein as required by law.  Such Release shall be provided to Executive within five (5) calendar days following Termination and shall specifically relate to all of Executive s rights and claims in existence at the time of such execution, including any claims related to Executive's employment by the Bank and his or her termination of employment, and shall exclude any obligations the Bank may have to Executive under this Agreement or any other agreement providing for obligations that survive Executive's termination of employment. 
  K.      Section 409A Compliance  .   
  (i)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder ( Section 409A ) and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith or exempt therefrom.  The Bank shall not be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on Executive by Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Section 409A.   
  (ii)    Termination of Executive s employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a  termination,   termination of employment  or like terms shall mean  separation from service.  
  (iii)    All expenses or other reimbursements under this Agreement that would constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, (A) shall be paid on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by Executive, (B) no such reimbursement or expenses eligible for reimbursement in any taxable year shall in any way affect Executive s right to reimbursement of any other expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year, and (C) Executive s right to reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation in exchange for any other benefit. 
  (iv)    For purposes of Section 409A, Executive s right to receive any installment payment pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. 
  (v)    Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g.,  payment shall be made within thirty (30) days  

following the date of termination ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Bank in order to comply with Section 409A. 
  (vi)    Notwithstanding any other provision under this Agreement, solely to the extent that a delay in payment is required in order to avoid the imposition of any tax under Section 409A, if a payment obligation under this Agreement arises on account of  Executive s  separation from service  (within the meaning of Section 409A) in good faith by the Bank s Board, then payment of any amount or benefit provided under this Agreement that is considered to be non-qualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A and that is scheduled to be paid within six (6) months after such separation from service shall be paid without interest on the first business day after the date that is six (6) months following Executive s separation from service. 
  (vii)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that constitutes  nonqualified deferred compensation  subject to Section 409A be subject to offset, counterclaim or recoupment by any other amount payable to Executive unless otherwise permitted by Section 409A. 
  (viii)    Executive hereby acknowledges that he has been advised to seek and has sought the advice of a tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences to Executive of all payments pursuant to this Agreement, including any adverse tax consequences or penalty taxes under Section 409A and corresponding provisions of applicable state tax law.  Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that no representations have been made to Executive relating to the tax treatment of any payment pursuant to this Agreement under Section 409A and the corresponding provisions of any applicable state income tax laws.  
  9.      Outside Employment  .  In addition to being prohibited from being employed or serving as an officer, investor or board member for any entity that will potentially create a conflict of interest, Executive shall not be employed in any paid position because the compensation paid to Executive envisions his exclusive services.  In addition, except as required to fulfill the requirements of Executive s position, Executive shall not serve on any board, participate as an active owner in any entity, or serve in any other capacity for another entity or business if such participation will in any way impinge or potentially adversely affect Executive s ability to provide the quality and quantity of services envisioned by this Agreement, it being acknowledged that service on civic or charitable boards or committees, service on no more than two (2) for-profit company boards, and delivering lectures and fulfilling speaking engagements, as set forth in Section 1, shall not be deemed to violate this section. 
  10.      Regulatory Approval  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any payments made to Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, are subject to prior review and non-objection by the Finance Agency, and are subject to and conditioned upon compliance with 12 U.S. C. section 4518(e), and any applicable laws and regulations, including 12 C.F.R. Part 1231.   
  11.      Representations  .  As a distinct and separate representation and warranty, Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Bank that (a) the execution, delivery and

The balance of a Participant s (or Former Participant s) Account as of any date shall be equal to the sum of the Participant s (or Former Participant s) Contribution Credits and Annual Indexation Credits, if any, as of that date, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 4.4(b) and 4.4(c) below and, if applicable, Sections 4.1(b) and (c).

  (b)    Rehired Individuals.  If an individual, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.3(c), once again becomes a Participant, then such individual s Account shall be determined as follows:  upon the date such individual once again becomes a Participant such individual s Account shall be redetermined (without regard to any distribution previously made or scheduled to be made) and shall be credited only with those amounts which were unvested at the time of the earlier termination and which were not a part of any distribution or scheduled  

distribution.  Any such unvested amounts shall be subject to the vesting requirements set forth in Section 4.5. 
  4.2    Contribution Credits 
  (a)    Crediting Accounts.  A Contribution Credit shall be credited to the Account of each Participant as follows: 
  (1)    The Contribution Credit for a Plan Year shall be credited to the Account of each Participant as of the last day of each Plan Year, beginning in 2003.  No Contribution Credit shall be credited to the Account of any Participant for, or with respect to, any year prior to 2003. 
  (2)    A Contribution Credit shall be credited to a Participant who has a Termination of Employment or who ceases to be a Participant but otherwise remains employed by the Bank during the course of a Plan Year solely for that portion of Plan Year during which the individual was a Participant.  The Contribution Credit for a Participant who has a Termination of Employment shall be credited as of the date of termination.  The Contribution Credit for a Participant who ceases to be a Participant but otherwise remains employed by the Bank shall be credited as of December 31 of the applicable Plan Year. 
  (3)    Subject to Section 4.4 and other applicable provisions of the Plan, the amount of the Contribution Credit credited to the Account of Participants shall be determined in accordance with Schedule A attached hereto unless the Board of Directors specifically provides that the amount of the Contribution Credit to a particular Participant s Account shall be determined in accordance with Schedule B attached hereto.  Additionally, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and from time to time, designate that the amount of the Contribution Credit credited to the Account of a particular Participant or Participants for a Plan Year shall be determined in  

accordance with a separate Schedule, which Schedule shall be attached hereto.  In no circumstances, however, shall the Account of a Participant be credited with Contribution Credits for a Plan Year under more than one Schedule.  The Board of Directors must designate any such alternative schedule (other than Schedule A) on or before December 31 of the Plan Year to which the schedule will apply to any Participant or group of Participants. 
  (b)    Former Participants.  No Contribution Credits shall be credited to the Account of any Former Participant with respect to any period of time such individual was not a Participant. 
  4.3    Annual Indexation Credits 
  (a)    Crediting Accounts.  Annual Indexation Credits shall be credited to the Accounts of Participants and Former Participants as follows:  
  (1)    The Annual Indexation Credit for a Plan Year shall be credited to the Account of Participants and Former Participants as of the last day of each Plan Year beginning in 2004.  No Annual Indexation Credit shall be credited to the Account of any Participant or Former Participant or with respect to any year prior to 2004. 
  (2)    Subject to Section 4.4 and other applicable provisions of the Plan, the amount of the Annual Indexation Credit credited to the Account of Participants and Former Participants shall be six percent (6%) of the balance of the Account determined as of the first day of the applicable Plan Year. 
  (b)    Proration; Cessation of Annual Indexation Credits.  The Annual Indexation Credit for the Plan Year in which a Participant or Former Participant receives, or begins receiving, payment of his or her benefit under this Plan shall be prorated as provided in Section 4.4(a)  

below and no further Annual Indexation Credits shall be credited to such Participant or Former Participant. 
  4.4    Special Rules For Determining Balance of Accounts and for Crediting Contribution Credits and Annual Indexation Credits 
  (a)    Proration.  If the Account of a Participant or Former Participant is determined as of a date during the Plan Year, the rules set forth in Section 4.2 and 4.3 shall be applied by treating the date of determination as the end of a short Plan Year.  In such a case, the Participant s Compensation for the Plan Year to the calculation date shall be used in determining Compensation and the Contribution Credit, and the Annual Indexation Credit shall be prorated to reflect the portion of the year that has been completed as of the date of determination.   
  (b)    Total Retirement Income   Current Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Total Retirement Income of a Participant or Former Participant shall be limited to fifty percent (50%) of the Participant s or Former Participant s Final Average Pay, and a Participant s or Former Participant s Contribution Credits and/or Annual Indexation Credits, as applicable, under this Plan shall be adjusted as set forth in Section 4.4(d) below in order to ensure that such limit is observed.  For this purpose Total Retirement Income shall be determined as of the earlier of the last day of the current Plan Year and the date payments begin, and Final Average Pay shall be determined as of the earliest of the last day of the current Plan Year, Termination of Employment (if any), and the date the Participant ceases to be a Participant (if any). 
  (c)    Total Retirement Income   Projected Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the projected Total Retirement Income of a Participant shall be limited to fifty percent (50%) of the Participant s projected Final Average Pay, and a Participant s  

Contribution Credits and/or Annual Indexation Credits, as applicable, under this Plan shall be adjusted as set forth in Section 4.4(d) below in order to ensure that such limit is observed.  For this purpose, in the case of a Participant who has not yet attained age 65, Total Retirement Income and Final Average Pay shall be projected from the last day of the current Plan Year to the date the Participant attains age 65 by assuming four percent (4%) annual pay increases and that the Participant remains a Participant until such projected date.  The projected limitation under this Section 4.4(c) shall not apply unless the Participant remains a Participant until the last day of the Plan Year. 
  (d)    If, pursuant to Section 4.4(b), a Participant s or Former Participant s Total Retirement Income exceeds the fifty percent (50%) limits set forth in Sections 4.4(b), then Contribution Credits and/or Annual Indexation Credits, as applicable, for the current and, if necessary, prior Plan Years shall be reduced as necessary to limit Total Retirement Income accordingly.  If such Participant s or Former Participant s Total Retirement Income subsequently falls below the fifty percent (50%) limits set forth in Section 4.4(b), then any Contribution Credits and/or Annual Indexation Credits previously reduced shall be restored as necessary. 
  (e)    If, pursuant to Section 4.4(c), a Participant s or Former Participant s Total Retirement Income is projected to exceed the fifty percent (50%) limits set forth in Section 4.4(c), then the projected future Contribution Credits and/or Annual Indexation Credits, as applicable, shall be reduced, and, if necessary, Contribution Credits and/or Annual Indexation Credits for the current Plan Year, and then any prior Plan Years, shall be reduced to the extent required to limit the projected Total Retirement Income accordingly.  If such Participant s or Former Participant s Total Retirement Income subsequently is projected to fall below the fifty percent (50%) limits set forth in 4.4(c), then any Contribution Credits and/or Annual Indexation  

Credits previously reduced shall be restored as necessary, first with respect to any prior Plan Years in order of the most recently reduced, and second with respect to projected Plan Years. 
  4.5        Vesting 
  The interest of each Participant in his or her Account shall vest as follows: 
  (a)    Vesting of Contribution Credits.  Each Participant shall become fully vested in a particular Contribution Credit upon the completion of three (3) years of Vesting Service following the beginning of the Plan Year (or portion thereof) with respect to which such Contribution Credit is credited to the Participant s Account. 
  (b)    Vesting of Annual Indexation Credits.  Each Participant shall become fully vested in that portion of each Annual Indexation Credit which has been credited to his or her Account with respect to a particular Contribution Credit at the time such Participant becomes fully vested in such Contribution Credit and all further Annual Indexation Credits with respect to that vested Contribution Credit shall be fully vested. 
  (c)    Attainment of Age 62.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, each Participant shall become fully vested in his or her Account on the date such Participant attains age 62 and all further Contribution Credits and Annual Indexation Credits to such Participant s Account shall be fully vested. 
  4.6    Forfeiture 
  (a)    Termination for Cause.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, each Participant shall forfeit his or her entire Account (whether vested or nonvested) if the Participant has a Termination of Employment for Cause.  For purposes of the Plan, Cause  

shall be determined by the Bank in its sole discretion using the definition set forth in Section 
  2.1(i). 
  (b)    Termination Prior to Attaining Age 62.  Subject to the provisions of Section 4.1(b) and pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.5, each Participant whose Termination of Employment prior to the date the Participant attains age 62 shall forfeit the unvested final three (3) years of Contribution Credits credited to his or her Account under the Plan. 
  ARTICLE 5.  PAYMENT OF BENEFITS; DEATH BENEFITS 
  5.1    Amount of Benefit 
  The benefit payable under this Plan to a Participant or Former Participant shall be equal to such individual s vested Account balance at the time payment is made or commences.   
  5.2    Automatic Form of Benefit Payment 
  Unless a Participant or Former Participant elects, in the manner prescribed in Section 5.6, an optional form of benefit payment set forth in Section 5.3 within 30 days of first becoming a Participant, the automatic form of benefit payment under the Plan shall be a single lump sum. 
  5.3    Optional Forms of Benefit Payments 
  A Participant or Former Participant may elect in accordance with Section 5.6 to receive his or her benefits in one of the following optional forms of payment (which shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the automatic form provided in Section 5.2) to the extent applicable:

(b)    A Contingent fifty Percent (50%) Annuitant Option.  An annuity payable as of the first day of each month to the Participant or Former Participant, for life, with a continuing annuity to the Beneficiary if the Beneficiary survives the Participant or Former Participant, in an amount which is fifty percent (50%) of the monthly annuity payable to the Participant or Former Participant, beginning with the first day of the month following the Participant s or Former Participant s death and continuing for the Beneficiary s lifetime. 
  5.4    Automatic Time of Benefit Payment 
  (a)    Automatic Time.  Unless a Participant or Former Participant elects, in the manner prescribed in Section 5.6, an optional time of benefit payment within 30 days of first becoming a Participant, the automatic time of payment of a benefit under the Plan shall be the earlier of the Participant s Termination of Employment, death or Disability. 
  (b)    Date Payment is Made.  Payment of a benefit under the Plan shall begin as soon as administratively practicable, but not later than 90 days, following Termination of Employment, death or Disability.  The Bank shall decide, in its sole discretion, the exact date payment shall begin within such 90-day period. 
  5.5    Optional Time of Benefit Payment 
  Notwithstanding Section 5.4(b) above, if a Participant has a Termination of Employment at age 45 or older he may elect to defer payment of benefits under the Plan beyond such Termination of Employment, provided such election is made in accordance with Section 5.6 and the distribution is to be made on a specified date, death or Disability.      No payment of benefits may be made under this Plan prior to Termination of Employment, death or Disability.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions shall commence no later than the April 1 following  

the end of the calendar year in which the later of the two following events occur: (1) the Participant reaches age 70  , or (2) the Participant has a Termination of Employment. 
  5.6    Manner and Time of Elections 
  (a)    The election of an optional form or time of benefit payment shall be made on such forms as may be prescribed by the Bank.  Except as provided in Section 5.6(b), a Participant must make an election regarding the optional form of benefit and the optional time of benefit payment within 30 days of first becoming a Participant and such election shall be irrevocable on the beginning of the 31st day after becoming a Participant.  If no election is made within such 30 days, the automatic form of benefit payment and automatic time of benefit payment rules will apply.  A Participant (or Former Participant) may modify his election or the automatic form and time of benefit but the date the modification is submitted to the administrator must be at least twelve (12) months prior to the Participant s (or Former Participant s) scheduled distribution date, the modification shall not be effective for twelve (12) months after it becomes irrevocable and the first payment under the modified distribution date must occur at least five (5) years after the date such payment would have been made absent the modification; provided, however, that the additional five (5) years shall not apply to payments elected to be made upon death or to any change in the form of payment between annuities that are Actuarial Equivalents.  The election to modify in the preceding sentence shall be irrevocable twelve (12) months prior to the scheduled distribution date absent the modification. 
  (b)    The rules regarding elections apply to rehired employees described in Section 4.1(b), in the same way it applies to newly eligible employees. 

(c)    Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, during 2008 a Participant may modify the form of distribution and the distribution date elected under Section 5.6(a), provided that the election is made not later than December 31, 2008.  No election under this Section shall: (1) change the payment date of any distribution otherwise scheduled to be paid in 2008 or cause a payment to be paid in 2008, or (2) be permitted after December 31, 2008. 
  (d)    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no distribution shall be made from the Plan that would constitute an impermissible acceleration of payment as defined in Section 409A(a)(3) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
  (e)    The Committee may delay any payment to a Participant or Former Participant upon the Committee s reasonable anticipation of one or more of the following: (i) making such payment would jeopardize the Bank s ability to continue as a going concern and the payment is made to the Participant during the first taxable year in which making the payment would not have such effect on the Bank; or (ii) making such payment would violate Federal securities laws or other applicable law. 
  5.7    Death Benefits 
  (a)    In the case of a Participant or Former Participant: 
  (1)    who has a vested interest in his or her Account balance; and 
  (2)    who dies before benefit payment has been made in the case of the lump sum automatic form of payment pursuant to Section 5.2, or who has elected the life annuity form of payment pursuant to Section 5.3(a) and dies before payment has begun, the amount of the vested Account balance shall be paid in a lump sum to the Participant s or Former Participant s  

Beneficiary eighteen (18) months after the death of the Participant or Former Participant.  In order to change the form or the time of the payment, the Beneficiary must make an election within six (6) months after the Participant s or Former Participant s death to receive a distribution in a form that is available to Beneficiaries under Section 5.3, such election shall be irrevocable on the six (6) month anniversary of the Participant s death and shall not be effective for twelve (12) months after the date such election becomes irrevocable.  If the Beneficiary fails to make a timely election, the Beneficiary will receive the benefit in the form of a lump sum at the end of the eighteen (18) month period.  The Beneficiary cannot elect to receive: (1) payment past the date that is the April 1 following the end of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70  , (2) benefits in a form not allowed under the Cash Balance Plan and (3) benefits before the end of the eighteen (18) month period. 
  (b)    In the case of a Participant or Former Participant: 
  (1)    who has a vested interest in his or her Account balance; and

  A Participant or Former Participant may designate a person or other entity as the Beneficiary to receive any death benefit payable under the Plan.  Each Beneficiary designation  

shall be in the form prescribed by the Bank, shall be effective only when properly filed in writing with the Bank before the earlier of the Participant s or Former Participant s death or the time payment is made or commences, and shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant or Former Participant. 
  ARTICLE 6.  SOURCE OF PAYMENTS 
  All benefits payable under the Plan shall be paid as they become due and payable by the Bank out of its general assets.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind for the benefit of Participants, Former Participants or their Beneficiaries or create a fiduciary relationship between the Bank and the Participants, Former Participants or their Beneficiaries. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive benefits under the Plan, such rights shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditors of the Bank.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank may, in its sole discretion, execute a trust agreement with a trustee, or enter into one or more contracts with an insurance company or companies, or adopt a combination of both methods of funding.  Any such trust so established shall be a  rabbi  grantor trust under Sections 671 through 679.

  (c)    Committee Procedures.  The Committee shall elect or designate one of its own members as Chair, establish its own procedures and the time and place for its meetings and provide for the keeping of minutes of all meetings.  A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by the Committee.  Any action of the Committee may be taken upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members at a meeting or, at the direction of its Chair, without a meeting by mail or telephone, provided  

that all of the Committee members are informed in writing of the matter to be voted upon.  The Committee may establish procedures pursuant to which a Committee member may elect not to participate in a Committee proceeding in which such member has an interest.  No Committee member shall be entitled to act on or decide any matters relating solely to such Committee member as a Participant or any of his or her rights or benefits under the Plan. 
  (d)    Expenses.  All expenses incurred by the Committee in its administration of the Plan shall be paid by the Bank.

  7.2    Procedures for Requesting Benefit Payments 
  To obtain Plan benefits, a Participant, Former Participant or Beneficiary must file a written application with the Bank.  Procedures for filing a claim in the event that Plan benefits are denied in whole or in part may be obtained from the Bank. 

ARTICLE 8.   AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 
  8.1    Amendment of the Plan 
  The Bank reserves the right to amend the Plan at any time and in any respect whatsoever by action of its Board of Directors or by such other means as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors.  The President of the Bank shall have authority to make administrative and other amendments to the Plan as may be necessary or appropriate to facilitate the administration, management, and interpretation of the Plan or to conform the Plan thereto (including any such amendments as necessary or appropriate from time to time to conform the Plan to changes in applicable laws), provided that any such amendment or action does not have a material effect on the then currently estimated cost to the Bank of maintaining the Plan.  All amendments to the Plan that have a material effect on the then currently estimated cost to the Bank of maintaining the Plan must be approved by the Board of Directors.  Retroactive Plan amendments may not decrease the Account balance of any Participant or Former Participant determined as of the time the amendment is adopted, unless the Participant or Former Participant consents in writing. 
  8.2    Termination of the Plan 
  While it is the intent of the Bank to maintain the Plan indefinitely, it reserves the right to terminate the Plan in whole or in part by action of the Board of Directors (or by such other means as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors) at any time. 
  Upon termination of the Plan, no further benefits shall accrue under the Plan to any Participant or Former Participant.  In the event of a termination of the Plan, the Bank may determine that the Accounts will be distributed.  If the Board of Directors determines that the Plan is to be terminated and distributions are to be made, the Accounts will be distributed within  

the period beginning twelve (12) months after the date the Plan was terminated and ending twenty-four (24) months after the date the Plan was terminated, or pursuant to Article 5 of the Plan, if earlier, and otherwise in accordance with Treasury Regulation   1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C).  Any liquidation and termination of the Plan will not occur proximate to a downturn in the financial health of the Bank, as prohibited by Code Section 409A.  If the Plan is terminated and Accounts are distributed, the Bank shall: (1) terminate all arrangements for Participants that are required to be aggregated with the Plan under Code Section 409A and (2) not adopt a new plan for Participants that would be aggregated with the Plan under Code Section 409A, at any time within three (3) years following the date of the termination of the Plan. 
  8.3    Change in Control 
  The Bank may terminate the Plan within 30 days prior to or twelve (12) months following a Change in Control and distribute the Accounts of the Participants or Former Participants within the twelve (12) month period following a termination of the Plan and otherwise in accordance with Treasury Regulation   1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B).  If the Plan is terminated and Accounts are distributed in connection with a Change in Control, the Bank shall: (1) terminate all arrangements for Participants that are required to be aggregated with the Plan under Code Section 409A and (2) not adopt a new plan for Participants that would be aggregated with the Plan under Code Section 409A, at any time within three years following the date of the termination of the Plan. 
  8.4    Dissolution or Bankruptcy 
  The Plan shall automatically terminate upon a corporate dissolution or bankruptcy provided that Participants  (or Former Participant s) Accounts are distributed and included in the gross income of the Participants (or Former Participants) by the latest of: (i) the Plan Year in  

which the Plan termination, (ii) the first Plan Year in which payment of the Accounts is administratively practicable, or (iii) the calendar year in which the amount is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and otherwise in accordance with Treasury Regulation   1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C).  A corporate dissolution or bankruptcy will have occurred only if the transaction qualifies as both a liquidation or reorganization under 12 United States Code Section 1446(26) and a dissolution or bankruptcy under Code Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
  ARTICLE 9.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
  9.1    Employment Rights 
  Nothing contained in this Plan or any modification of the Plan or act done in pursuance of this Plan shall be construed as giving any Participant or Former Participant any legal or equitable right with respect to his or her employment against the Bank (or any director, officer or employee thereof), unless specifically provided in this Plan or under applicable law, or as giving any person a right to be retained in the employ of the Bank.  All employees shall remain subject to assignment, reassignment, promotion, transfer, layoff, reduction, suspension, and discharge to the same extent as if this Plan had never been established. 
  9.2    No Examination or Accounting 
  Neither this Plan nor any action taken under it shall be construed as giving any person the right to an accounting or to examine the books or affairs of the Bank, the Plan, or the Committee, except to the extent required by law. 

9.3    Records Conclusive 
  The records of the Bank and the Committee shall be conclusive in respect to all matters involved in the administration of the Plan to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
  9.4    Severability 
  In the event any provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this Plan, and it shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had never been included. 
  9.5    Counterparts 
  This Plan may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original.  All the counter parts shall constitute but one and the same instrument and may be sufficiently evidenced by any one counterpart. 
  9.6    Taxes 
  The Bank shall withhold, or cause to be withheld, from all benefits payable under the Plan all federal, state, local or other taxes required by applicable law be withheld with respect to such payment. 
  9.7    Binding Effect 
  The Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Bank and its successors and assigns and the Participants, Former Participants, their Beneficiaries and estates.  The Plan shall also be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successor organization succeeding to substantially all of the assets and business of the Bank, but nothing in the Plan shall preclude the Bank from merging or consolidating into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its  

assets to, another organization which assumes the Plan and all obligations of the Bank thereunder. 
  In any agreement or plan which the Bank may enter into to effect any merger, consolidation, reorganization, or transfer of assets, except as provided in Section 8.3, the Bank agrees that it shall make appropriate provision for the preservation of the Participants  and Former Participants  benefits accrued under the Plan prior to such merger, consolidation, reorganization or transfer of assets.  Upon such a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or transfer of assets and assumption of the Plan obligations of the Bank, the term  Bank  shall refer to such other organization and the Plan shall continue in full force and effect. 
  9.8    Assignment 
  No Participant or Former Participant or Beneficiary shall have the right to assign, transfer, hypothecate, encumber or anticipate his or her benefits under the Plan, nor shall the benefits under this Plan be subject to any legal process to levy upon or attach the benefits for payment of any claim against the Participant or Former Participant or his or her Beneficiary.  In the event of any attempted assignment or transfer, the Bank shall have no further liability hereunder.  The foregoing notwithstanding, in accordance with procedures that are established by the Committee (including procedures requiring prompt notification to the affected Participant or Former Participant and each alternate payee of the receipt by the Plan or the Bank of a domestic relations order and its procedures for determining the qualified status of such order) and subject to Code Section 409A, a judicial order for purposes of or pertaining to domestic relations (which orders do not alter the amount, timing, or form of benefit other than to have it commence at the earliest permissible date) shall be honored by the Plan and the Bank if the Committee or its designee determines that such order would constitute a qualified domestic relations order (within  

the meaning of Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code) if the Plan were a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. 
  9.9    Incapacity 
  If the Committee is presented with credible evidence that any person to whom any amount is or was payable under the Plan is unable to care for his or her affairs because of illness or accident, or is a minor, or has died, then any payment, or any part thereof, due to such person or his or her estate (unless a prior claim therefor has been made by a duly appointed legal representative), may, if the Committee is so inclined, be paid to such person s spouse, child, or other relative, an institution maintaining or having custody of such person, or any other person deemed by the Committee to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person otherwise entitled to payment.  In making such a finding the Committee may rely on the advice of experts chosen by the Committee in its sole discretion.  Any payment consequent on such finding shall be in complete discharge of the liability of the Plan and the Bank therefor. 
  9.10    Unsecured Creditor 
  To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Bank under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Bank. 
  9.11    Notice 
  Any election, application, claim, designation, request, notice, instruction or other communication required or permitted to be made by a Participant, Former Participant, Beneficiary, or other person to the Committee shall be made in writing and in such form as is prescribed from time to time by the Committee and shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage  

pre-paid or delivered to such location as shall be specified by the Committee and shall be deemed to have been given and delivered only upon receipt thereof at such location. 
  9.12    Benefits Not Salary 
  The benefits payable under the Plan shall be independent of, and in addition to, any other benefits provided by the Bank and shall not be deemed salary or other remuneration by the Bank for the purpose of computing benefits to which any Participant or Former Participant may be entitled under any other plan or arrangement of the Bank. 
  9.13    Captions 
  The captions preceding the sections of the Plan have been inserted solely as a matter of convenience and shall not in any manner define or limit the scope or intent of any provisions of the Plan. 
  9.14    Governing Law 
  The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded Plan for a select group of employees and rights thereunder shall be construed according to the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the choice of law principles thereof, and the laws of the United States, as applicable.  The Plan shall be construed in a manner that is consistent and compliant with Section 409A of the Code, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.  Any provision that is noncompliant with Section 409A of the Code is void or deemed amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  The Bank does not guarantee or warrant the tax consequences of the Plan, and the Participants shall in all cases be liable for any taxes due with respect to the Plan. 

9.15    Addresses 
  Each Participant or Former Participant must file with the Bank from time to time in writing his or her post office address and each change of post office address.  The communication, statement or notice addressed to a Participant or Former Participant at the last post office address filed with the Bank, or if no address is filed with the Bank, then at the last post office address as shown on the records of the Bank, shall be binding on the Participant or Former Participant and his or her Beneficiaries for all purposes of the Plan.  The Bank shall not be required to search for or locate a Participant, Former Participant or his or her Beneficiary.

  EXHIBIT 10.7 
  
  FHLBank San Francisco 
  2016 PRESIDENT S INCENTIVE PLAN 

PLAN PURPOSE 
  To optimize individual and Bank performance in accomplishing Board-approved goals and objectives. 
    
  PLAN OBJECTIVES 
  To motivate the Bank President to exceed individual and Bank goals that support the Bank s mission and strategic plan. To attract and retain an outstanding executive by providing a competitive total compensation program, including an annual incentive award opportunity. 
    
  ELIGIBILITY 
  The 2016 participant is the Bank President. 
    
  The Bank President must be employed by the Bank through January 1, 2017 to be eligible for an incentive award under the 2016 plan. A Bank President hired, promoted, or who takes a leave of absence during the plan year is eligible to participate on a pro-rata basis. A Bank President hired or promoted on or after October 1   st    may be eligible to participate during the current plan year at the discretion of the Board. 
    
  INCENTIVE GOALS AND MEASURES 
    
  Incentive Goals 
  For the Bank President there are individual and Bank goals, which are weighted.  The individual goal(s) support the Bank-wide goals (  See 2016 Short-Term Incentive Plan Goals and Measures  ) and objectives. 
    
  The three Bank goals for 2016 are: 
    
           1. 
    2016 Risk Management Goal  : Continue to enhance and advance the function and approaches to the Bank s risk management. 
       
           2. 
    2016 Franchise Enhancement Goal  : Position the Bank and the FHLBank System to remain an integral component of the changing housing and financial services markets.  Continue to meet the Bank's mission objectives within these markets as they are currently structured, but also influence and adapt to structural changes in those markets. 
       
           3. 
    2016 Community Investment Goal  : Support and promote the Bank s Affordable Housing Program and Community Investment Programs. 
       
  Incentive Goal Achievement Measures 
  The plan levels of goal achievement are as follows: 
    
                 Achievement Level 
    Measure Definition 
      Far Exceeds 
    The most optimistic achievement level that far exceeds expected performance. 
      Exceeds 
    An optimistic achievement level that exceeds expected performance. 
      Meets 
    Performance that is expected under the Bank's Plan. 
      Threshold 
    Minimum level of performance that must be achieved for awards to be paid. 

Actual achievement of Bank goals is subject to adjustment for changes resulting from changes in financial strategies or policies, any significant change in Bank membership, as well as other factors determined by the Board.  Impacts of OTTI credit charges are excluded from the achievement levels and 

measurement of performance for the Adjusted Return on Capital Spread component of the Franchise Enhancement Goal. Impacts of dividend benchmark variances to plan are also excluded from the measurement of Adjusted Return on Capital Spread performance. 
    
  January 2016 

AWARD DETERMINATION AND OPPORTUNITY 
  Any award will be based on success in achieving the individual and Bank goals, and on the overall performance. At yearend, accomplishments will be assessed and a percentage of achievement will be determined for each goal and any award determination shall be approved by the Board. 

For each goal, the percentage of achievement will be multiplied by the applicable weights. Each weighted achievement will then be added to determine the total weighted achievement.  The basis for any award opportunity for the participant is total weighted achievement. Total weighted achievement from Threshold achievement level (75-99%) is below the Meets achievement level and, therefore, results in an award less than one granted for achieving the Meets achievement level. Total weighted achievement below the Threshold achievement level normally will not result in an incentive award. The Board of Directors has full discretion to modify any and all goals, achievement levels, and incentive payments to account for matters not specifically addressed in the plan, subject to review by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, as required. Incentive compensation reductions may be made, but are not limited to the following circumstances: (i) if errors or omissions result in material revisions to the Bank s financial results, information submitted to a regulatory or a reporting agency, or information used to determine incentive compensation payouts; (ii) if information submitted to a regulatory or a reporting agency is untimely; or, (iii) if the Bank does not make appropriate progress in the timely remediation of examination, monitoring, or other supervisory findings and matters requiring attention. 
    
  APPROVAL OF INCENTIVE AWARDS 
  The amount of the incentive award, if any, under this plan shall be approved by the Board of Directors, including any award for achievement below Threshold.  Awards will be considered by the Board of Directors at the January 2017 Board meeting, or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable. 
    
  TIMING OF PAYMENT OF FINAL INCENTIVE AWARDS 
  Payment of the incentive award, if any, will be paid in the taxable year immediately following the end of the performance period and no later than 60 days after the date that the Board of Directors  approval of such award becomes effective. 
    
  PLAN ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION 
  The Board of Directors oversees the administration and interpretation of the plan. 
    
  The plan is intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the provisions of the plan shall be construed and interpreted consistent with such intent. 

All compensation and incentive plans are subject to review and revision at the Bank s discretion.  Such plans are reviewed regularly to ensure they are competitive and equitable.  Executive Officer compensation and benefit programs are subject to Federal Housing Finance Agency review and oversight, and payments made under such programs may not become effective until after the Agency s non-objection under applicable laws and regulations in effect from time to time.

  Exhibit 10.3 
  
  FHLBank San Francisco      2014 Executive Performance Unit Plan      Summary Description  
    
  PLAN PURPOSE 
  To optimize the Bank s performance in accomplishing Board-approved goals. 
  PLAN OBJECTIVES 
  To motivate key executives to position the Bank to exceed specified long-term Bank goals that directly support the Bank s mission and strategic plan. To attract and retain outstanding executives by providing a competitive total compensation program, including a cash-based long-term incentive reward opportunity tied to the performance of the Bank against specified performance measures. 
  PARTICIPANTS 
  Participants are key executives whose performance has a major impact on the Bank s success. Participants are the incumbents in the Bank s senior officer positions, including: 
  President 
  Executive Vice President 
  Senior Vice Presidents (excluding the Senior Vice President, Director of Internal Audit   participates in the Audit Performance Unit Plan) 
  PERFORMANCE PERIOD 
  The Executive Performance Unit Plan (EPUP) pays incentive awards related to the achievement of Bank performance over a three-year performance period. The 2014 EPUP is effective January 1, 2014, and is based on performance from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016. 
  PERFORMANCE METRICS 
  Performance metrics balance financial and risk management objectives, focusing on achievement of Adjusted Return on Capital Spread and Risk Management goals. Adjusted Return on Capital Spread will be weighted 30% and Risk Management will be weighted 70%. The Meets performance level reflects long-term performance expectations. Unlike the President s Incentive Plan (PIP) and Executive Incentive Plan (EIP), participants do not have an individual goal under the EPUP. 
           1. 
    3-Year Average Adjusted Return on Capital Spread  : Adjusted Return on Capital Spread (AROCS) is the primary measure the Bank uses to determine total rate of return to shareholders. The Meets AROCS achievement level has been set at 3.27% and represents the projected average for the performance period (January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016). The Meets AROCS achievement level is consistent with the Bank s Strategic Plan forecast and reflects the Bank s continued mission-consistent focus on member s mortgage finance business. Threshold AROCS has been set at 3.02%, Exceeds achievement level has been set at 3.52% and Far Exceeds achievement level has been set at 3.77%. 
              2. 
    3-Year Average Risk Management  : Risk Management is based on the 3-year average of the actual Risk Management goal achievement levels under the 2014, 2015, and 2016 annual incentive plans, and will be set at the end of the performance period. 
       
  Actual achievement of Bank goals is subject to adjustment for changes resulting from changes in financial strategies or policies, any significant change in Bank membership, as well as other factors determined by the Board. Impacts of OTTI credit charges are excluded from the Adjusted Return on Capital Spread achievement levels, but are included in the measurement of actual Adjusted 

Return on Capital Spread performance. Impacts of dividend benchmark variances to plan are excluded from the measurement of Adjusted Return on Capital Spread performance.

EPUP ACHIEVEMENT MEASURES 
  The Executive Performance Unit Plan rewards four levels of performance achievement, as follows: 
                 Achievement Level 
    Measure Definition 
      Far Exceeds 
    The most optimistic achievement level that far exceeds expected performance. 
      Exceeds 
    An optimistic achievement level that exceeds expected performance. 
      Meets 
    Performance that is expected under the Bank's Plan. 
      Threshold 
    Minimum level of performance that must be achieved for awards to be paid. 

AWARD DETERMINATION 
  An award is calculated and paid in whole or part at the end of the 2014 plan term (during the first quarter of 2017). Awards earned are based on the level at which the 3-year performance goals have been achieved. Final awards may be prorated for participants promoted or hired into an eligible position during the performance period, and for participants who take a leave of absence during the performance period.   Note that the percentages of award opportunity provided below are not the award percentages of base salary.   See below for award opportunities and ranges. 

Performance below the Threshold achievement level for either measure normally will not result in an incentive award.  The Board of Directors has full discretion to modify any and all goals, achievement levels, and incentive payments to account for matters not specifically addressed in the plan, subject to review by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, as required. Incentive compensation reductions may be made, but are not limited to the following circumstances: (i) if errors or omissions result in material revisions to the Bank s financial results, information submitted to a regulatory or a reporting agency, or information used to determine incentive compensation payouts; (ii) if information submitted to a regulatory or a reporting agency is untimely; or, (iii) if the Bank does not make appropriate progress in the timely remediation of examination, monitoring, or other supervisory findings and matters requiring attention. 
    
  AWARD DETERMINATION AND OPPORTUNITY 
  Achievement award levels are stated below as a percentage of the February 1   st    base salary at the beginning of the performance period. 
    
  2014-2016 EPUP Plan Period 

Awards will be considered by the Board of Directors at the end of the 3-year performance period (during the first quarter of 2017).      The amount of an award, if any, shall be approved by the Board of Directors.    

All incentive awards are governed by the terms and conditions of the 2014 Executive Performance Unit Plan.  In the event there is any conflict between the terms of this summary description and the terms of the plan document, the plan document shall govern. 
  To be eligible for the Executive Performance Unit Plan payment, participants must be employed with the Bank through the end of the 3-year performance period, except in the case of a voluntary normal retirement, a qualified long-term disability, or death. EPUP awards will be prorated for participants in position less than a full plan term, including participants who have a leave of absence greater than one month during the plan term. Any awards will be distributed as soon as administratively possible following the effective date of Board approval. All compensation and incentive plans are subject to review and revision at the Bank s discretion. Such plans are reviewed regularly to ensure they are competitive and equitable. Executive Officer compensation and benefit programs are subject to Federal Housing Finance Agency review and oversight, and payments made under such programs may not become effective until after the Agency's non-objection under applicable laws and regulations in effect from time to time.

  EXHIBIT 10.16 

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO 
  CORPORATE SENIOR OFFICER SEVERANCE POLICY 
    
  PRESIDENT 
  EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT 
  SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT 

Effective:  June 1, 2011 
  Amended and Restated:  August 14, 2013 

CORPORATE SENIOR OFFICER SEVERANCE POLICY   1   
  For the President, Executive Vice President and Senior Vice Presidents 

ESTABLISHMENT 
    
  The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the  Bank ), pursuant to the powers granted it under 12 U.S.C. Section 1432, established on January 25, 1996, a severance policy, which has subsequently been restated from time to time, for eligible Corporate Senior Officers (the  Corporate Senior Officer Severance Policy  or  Policy ).  The Policy is effective June 1, 2011, as provided herein. 
  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 
    
  The Bank reserves the right to amend, add, modify, or terminate the Policy, in whole or in part, at any time it deems appropriate,   provided  ,   however  , that, following a merger, reorganization, or consolidation of the Bank; sale of all or substantially all the business or assets of the Bank; or other similar transaction, no such amendment will impair the then-existing rights of an eligible Corporate Senior Officer under the Policy.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendments, additions, modifications or terminations of this Policy will be effective only to the extent such amendments, additions, modifications, or terminations are permitted by Applicable Laws.   
  Adoption of this Policy by the Bank is not to be construed as a contract between the Bank and any of its Corporate Senior Officers nor is it intended to create any absolute right, vested or otherwise, to any severance benefit for any Corporate Senior Officer. 
  POLICY 
    
  The purpose of the Policy is to help provide protection from loss of income because of unemployment while an eligible Corporate Senior Officer seeks other employment and to ensure that the Bank will have the continued dedication and objectivity of each eligible Corporate Senior Officer, notwithstanding the possibility, threat, or occurrence of a termination of employment or potential transaction involving the Bank.  Because of changing economic and business conditions, most organizations must continually evaluate their operations and be prepared to make changes in the structure of their workforces.  Similarly, the Bank s changing business environment may require it to consider strategic alternatives; restructure, modify, or eliminate jobs; and reduce staff from time to time.  Should an eligible Corporate Senior Officer be affected by one of these events, he or she will be notified and, if eligible under the guidelines listed below, receive severance benefits upon signing a Severance Agreement and Release. 
  ____________________________________ 
   1   For purposes of this Corporate Senior Officer Severance Policy, a  Corporate Senior Officer  is defined as an officer at or above the level of Senior Vice President. 
    
  1 

This Policy sets forth and describes the options, benefits, and severance pay that may be provided to eligible Corporate Senior Officers.  The application of the provisions contained in this Policy will be made on a nondiscriminatory basis in accordance with the Bank s equal employment opportunity policy, or any other basis prohibited by law. 
  This Policy is not intended for application in any situations in which the Bank continues to offer employment to affected Corporate Senior Officers on substantially the same terms, or in any situation in which the Corporate Senior Officer does not suffer loss of employment. 
  ELIGIBILITY 
    
  A full-time or part-time Corporate Senior Officer may be eligible for severance benefits under the Policy provided that the Corporate Senior Officer is on the official payroll of the Bank on the Effective Date of Separation (as defined below).   
  A Corporate Senior Officer will be eligible to receive severance pay and benefits upon certain involuntary Separation from Service (as defined below) from the Bank resulting from a  Qualifying Termination : 
           (a) 
    elimination of an individual job or position; 
       
           (b) 
    elimination of one or more jobs or positions as a result of a reduction in staff or department reorganization;  
       
           (c) 
    substantial job modification resulting in the incumbent Corporate Senior Officer being, in the judgment of the Bank, unqualified for or unable to perform the revised job; or 
       
           (d) 
    certain involuntary Separations from Service (as defined below) from the Bank made in connection with a Change in Control of the Bank (as described in Exhibit A). 
       
  In all situations in which the Bank gives the Corporate Senior Officer more than one week notice of eligibility, the Bank may condition that Corporate Senior Officer s eligibility upon his/her remaining on the job until the date the Separation from Service (as defined below) becomes effective, as specified by the Bank. 
  A Corporate Senior Officer is not eligible for severance pay under this Policy in any event other than (a) through (d), above, and in particular if he or she: 
           (a) 
    voluntarily terminates employment with the Bank for any reason prior to the Effective Date of Separation (as defined below) set by the Bank (other than for certain limited reasons in connection with a Change in Control, as described in Exhibit A); 
       
           (b) 
    is terminated by the Bank for any reason other than job elimination, reduction in staff, department reorganization, or job modification as described above; 
       
  2 

(c) 
    is terminated because of the Corporate Senior Officer s death or for cause (including, without limitation, gross misconduct or dereliction of duty) or for failure to meet performance goals or objectives as determined by the Bank; 
       
           (d) 
    retires from the Bank under conditions not involving job elimination, reduction in staff, department reorganization, or job modification as described above; 
       
           (e) 
    accepts any job with another employer that acquired any of the assets or operations of the Bank or with an outsourcing supplier (an outsourcing supplier is defined as an entity to which the Bank outsources a function performed by the Corporate Senior Officer where the Bank agrees with the entity in the outsourcing agreement that it will offer jobs to current Corporate Senior Officers performing that function for the Bank); 
       
           (f) 
    is on a leave of absence at the time of the job elimination/staff reduction and does not return to work at the end of the approved leave period; or 
       
           (g) 
    refuses an equivalent job offer, either within the Bank or with another employer that acquired any of the assets or operations of the Bank (an equivalent job offer is defined as a job offer for a position with a comparable level of responsibility, skill and knowledge requirements, and pay). 
       
  For purposes of this Policy, a  Separation from Service  means a  separation from service  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), and U.S. Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance thereunder ( Section 409A ), and will generally occur upon the termination of a Corporate Senior Officer s employment as a common-law employee of the Bank. 
  A Separation from Service will not be deemed to have occurred if a Corporate Senior Officer continues to provide services to the Bank at an annual rate that is fifty percent or more of the services rendered, on average, during the immediately preceding three full years of employment with the Bank (or if employed by the Bank less than three years, such lesser period); provided, however, that a Separation from Service will be deemed to have occurred if a Corporate Senior Officer s service with the Bank is reduced to an annual rate that is equal to or less than twenty percent of the services rendered, on average, during the immediately preceding three full years of employment with the Bank (or if employed by the Bank less than three years, such lesser period). 
  In addition to the foregoing, a Separation from Service will not be deemed to have occurred while a Corporate Senior Officer is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six months, or if longer, provided that the Corporate Senior Officer s right to reemployment with the Bank is provided either by statute or contract.  If the period of leave exceeds six months and the Corporate Senior Officer s right to reemployment is not provided either by statute or contract, then the Corporate Senior Officer is deemed to have Separated from Service on the first day immediately following such six-month period.

The effective date of the Separation from Service is typically the Corporate Senior Officer s last day of employment as a common-law employee with the Bank as described in this section and will be determined in accordance with Section 409A (the  Effective Date of Separation ).  Any payments received after the Effective Date of Separation are considered severance pay and not salary. 
  SEVERANCE PAY AND BENEFIT 
    
  At the Bank s discretion, the Bank may either give the Corporate Senior Officer one week s notice of a Separation from Service and eligibility for severance, or pay the Corporate Senior Officer one week of base salary in lieu of notice.  Upon any termination, the Corporate Senior Officer will be paid his/her fully earned but unpaid base salary, paid by the Bank when due, through the date of termination at the rate then in effect, together with all other amounts and benefits to which the Corporate Senior Officer is entitled under any compensation, retirement or benefit plan or practice of the Bank at the time of termination, plus, if applicable, one week of base salary in lieu of notice on the Effective Date of Separation.  In the event an eligible Corporate Senior Officer experiences a Qualifying Termination, the Corporate Senior Officer will be eligible to receive additional severance benefits as described in Exhibit A. 
  Any severance paid under this Policy is subject to federal and state tax deductions and any other withholdings required by law. 
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, any severance and benefits payments made to the Corporate Senior Officer pursuant to this Policy, or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with 12 U.S.C.    4518(a) and 4518(e) and any regulations promulgated thereunder, including 12 C.F.R. Parts 1230 and 1231. 
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, if the Bank is not in compliance with applicable regulatory capital or regulatory leverage requirements or if any of the payments to be made pursuant to this Policy would cause the Bank to fall below the applicable regulatory requirements, the payment will be delayed until the Bank achieves compliance with such regulatory capital requirement. 
  RETENTION PAY 
    
  Retention pay may be provided at the Bank s discretion to specified Corporate Senior Officers for specific assignments.  The time at which the retention payment is made will be governed by the individual agreement between the specified Corporate Senior Officer and the Bank (the  Retention Agreement ).  Any retention pay provided by the Bank generally will not exceed 30% of the Corporate Senior Officer s regular earnings during the specified retention period, and will be payable at the time and in the form set forth in the Retention Agreement. 
  If the Corporate Senior Officer is eligible to receive retention pay under this Policy, he/she will receive payment from the Bank upon the Bank s receipt of a Severance Agreement and Release (as defined below) that has become irrevocable in accordance with its terms, applicable law, and the Retention Agreement. 
  4 

Retention pay is subject to federal and state tax deductions and any other withholdings required by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, any retention payments made to the Corporate Senior Officer pursuant to this Policy, or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with 12 U.S.C.    4518(a) and 4518(e) and any regulations promulgated thereunder, including 12 C.F.R. Parts 1230 and 1231. 
  SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND RELEASE 
    
  Upon a Separation from Service, the Corporate Senior Officer must execute an agreement acknowledging the Separation from Service with the Bank that includes an outline of the severance pay, retention pay (if applicable), and benefits package available to the Corporate Senior Officer, and a general waiver by the Corporate Senior Officer of any claims against the Bank in order to be eligible to receive any benefits or payments under this Policy (the  Severance Agreement and Release ).  The Corporate Senior Officer will have a specified period of time of at least one week (the  Specified Period ) within which to sign and return an executed version of the Severance Agreement and Release, with the Severance Agreement and Release becoming irrevocable. 
  If a Corporate Senior Officer signs the Severance Agreement and Release   after   the Specified Period has expired, the Corporate Senior Officer will receive two weeks of base salary for each full year of service, not to exceed twelve months of base salary, upon signing the Severance Agreement and Release. 
  If a Corporate Senior Officer is unwilling to sign the Severance Agreement and Release within the time period stated in the Severance Agreement and Release, the Corporate Senior Officer will not receive any severance pay or benefits pursuant to the Policy. In such a case, the Human Resources Department of the Bank should be notified so that any problem the Corporate Senior Officer perceives can be discussed and, if possible, resolved. 
  BENEFITS 
  Health and life insurance benefits will continue as described in Exhibit A.  Under the terms of the Bank s group health and life insurance benefit plans, the Corporate Senior Officer may request a continuation of coverage through conversion to an individual policy (i.e., health, life, and dependent life insurance).  Voluntary accident insurance coverage terminates at the end of the month in which the termination date occurred.  Except as otherwise set forth in Exhibit A, all other benefits that the Corporate Senior Officer received from the Bank during his/her employment will cease according to the terms, conditions, and policies governing such benefit plans. 
  Payment for accrued and unused vacation and holiday balances will be paid in a lump sum payment on the Effective Date of Separation and is subject to federal and state tax deductions and any other withholdings required by law. 
  Tuition assistance approved and paid by the Bank prior to the Effective Date of Separation need not be repaid to the Bank in the event the Corporate Senior Officer receives severance pay under this Policy. 
  5 

OUTPLACEMENT ASSISTANCE 
    
  Upon a Separation from Service, the Bank may, in its sole discretion, provide to former Corporate Senior Officers outplacement assistance, which may include job search assistance and counseling services (Outplacement Assistance).  Corporate Senior Officers may elect not to accept these services, if offered, but the Bank will not pay cash in lieu of Outplacement Assistance.  In the event the Corporate Senior Officer is receiving Outplacement Assistance, such benefit will terminate on the earlier of (a) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date of Separation, or (b) the Corporate Senior Officer s acceptance of an equivalent job offer for a position that has a comparable level of responsibility, skill and knowledge requirements, and salary. 
  ADMINISTRATION 
    
  This Policy will be administered by the Senior Vice President, Director of Human Resources, of the Bank (the  Administrator ).  Interpretation and construction by the Bank of any provisions of the Policy will be final.  Except as described above, the Bank may amend or rescind all or any part or parts of this Policy at any time and will make, at its sole discretion, any and all determinations necessary for its administration.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Bank will have the authority to determine eligibility for benefits and severance amounts. 
  Any exception to this Policy must be approved by the Bank President.   
  EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS 
    
  Nothing in this Policy is to be construed as a promise, implied or otherwise, of continued employment with the Bank, or any right to continue in any position or duties.  Bank management reserves the right to make any employment decision, at any time, deemed to be in the best interest of the Bank, and employment with the Bank may be terminated at any time and for any reason by the Bank or by the Corporate Senior Officer. 
  CLAIMS PROCEDURES 
    
  The Corporate Senior Officer may make a request for any Policy payments or benefits to which the Corporate Senior Officer believes he/she is entitled.  Any such request should be in writing and should be made to the Administrator at the address below:

  Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco  
  600 California Street, Suite 300 
  San Francisco, CA 94108 
  A Corporate Senior Officer s request for Policy payments or benefits will be considered a claim for Policy payments or benefits, and it will be subject to a full and fair review.  If the claim is wholly or partially denied, the Administrator will furnish the Corporate Senior Officer with a written notice of such denial.  This written notice must be provided to the Corporate Senior Officer within a  
  6 

reasonable period of time (generally 90 calendar days) after the receipt of the claim by the Administrator.  The written notice must contain the following information: 
  (1)        the specific reason or reasons for the denial; 
  (2)        specific reference to the Policy provisions on which the denial is based; 
  (3)        a description of any additional information or material necessary to correct the claim and an explanation of why the material or information is necessary; and, 
  (4)        appropriate information regarding the steps to be taken if the Corporate Senior Officer wishes to submit the claim for review. 
  If notice of the denial of a claim is not furnished to the Corporate Senior Officer in accordance with the above procedures within a reasonable period of time, the claim will be deemed denied.  The Corporate Senior Officer will then be permitted to proceed to the review stage. 
  If the claim has been denied or deemed denied, and the Corporate Senior Officer desires to submit the claim for review, the Corporate Senior Officer must follow the Claims Review Procedure below. 
  A Corporate Senior Officer may file a claim in writing with the Administrator upon a denial of a claim for payments or benefits. 
  THE CORPORATE SENIOR OFFICER MUST FILE THE CLAIM FOR REVIEW NO LATER THAN 60 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER HE/SHE HAS RECEIVED WRITTEN NOTIFICATION OF THE DENIAL OF HIS/HER CLAIM FOR PAYMENTS OR BENEFITS, OR IF NO WRITTEN DENIAL OF THE CLAIM WAS PROVIDED, NO LATER THAN 60 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE DEEMED DENIAL OF THE CLAIM. 
  The Corporate Senior Officer may review all pertinent documents relating to the denial of the claim and submit any issues and comments, in writing, to the Administrator, using the same address as listed above. 
  The Corporate Senior Officer s claim for review must be given a full and fair review by the Bank.  If the claim for review is denied, the Administrator must provide the Corporate Senior Officer with written notice of this denial within 60 calendar days after the Administrator s receipt of the written claim for review.  The 60-day period may be extended when there are special circumstances that are communicated to the Corporate Senior Officer in writing prior to the end of the 60-day period.  If there is an extension, a decision will be made as soon as possible, but not later than 120 calendar days after receipt by the Administrator of the claim for review. 
  The Bank s decision on the claim for review will be communicated to the Corporate Senior Officer in writing and will include specific references to the pertinent Policy provisions on which the decision was based. 
  If the Bank s decision on review is not furnished to the Corporate Senior Officer within the time limitations described above, the claim will be deemed denied on review. 

7 

If payments or benefits are provided or administered by an insurance company, insurance service, or other similar organization that is subject to regulation under the insurance laws, the claims procedure relating to those benefits may provide for review.  If so, that company, service, or organization will be the entity to which claims are addressed.  The Corporate Senior Officer may contact the Administrator with respect to any questions regarding the proper person or entity to whom the Corporate Senior Officer should address claims. 
  Any claim or controversy arising from a claim for payments or benefits that is denied or ignored will be settled by arbitration in San Francisco, California, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  Each party will pay the fees of its own attorneys, the expenses of its witnesses, and all other expenses connected with presenting its case; provided, however, that, except as may be prohibited by law, the arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, award reasonable attorneys  fees to the prevailing party.  Other costs of the arbitration, including the cost of any record or transcripts of the arbitration, administrative fees, the fee of the sole arbitrator, and all other fees and costs, will be borne by the Bank. 
  APPLICABLE LAWS 
  The Policy will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and, to the extent state law may be applicable, the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. 
  CODE SECTION 409A 
  Payments and benefits provided under this Policy are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, provided that, if any payment provided at any time hereunder involves non-qualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Policy is intended to comply with Section 409A of Code, and the Department of Treasury Regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder (   Section 409A   ) and the Policy shall be interpreted and construed as necessary to comply with such intent.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, payments under the Policy shall be treated as payments under the short-term deferral rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), then as payments or benefits provided as separation pay under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or as nontaxable benefits.  For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any right under this Policy to receive any installment payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.  To the extent applicable, if a Corporate Senior Officer is a  specified employee  within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B) on his or her date of termination of employment, then with regard to any payment that is considered non-qualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A payable on account of a Separation from Service, such payment or benefit shall be made or commence at the date which is the earlier of (A) the first day of the seventh month after the date of the Corporate Senior Officer s Separation from Service or (B) the date of the Corporate Senior Officer s death.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Policy to the contrary, in the event that the Bank determines that any compensation or benefits payable or provided hereunder may be subject to Section 409A, the Bank reserves the right (without any obligation to do so or to indemnify the Corporate Senior  

8 

Officer for failure to do so) to adopt such limited amendments to this Policy and appropriate policies and procedures, including amendments and policies with retroactive effect, that the Bank reasonably determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Policy from Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits provided with respect to this Policy or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A.  In no event may a Corporate Senior Officer, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Policy that is considered non-qualified deferred compensation.  In the event the time period for both considering any general release and the general release becoming irrevocable as a condition to receiving a severance payment or taxable benefit will overlap two calendar years, then no amount of such severance payment or taxable benefit shall be paid or provided in the earlier calendar year.  The Bank does not guarantee the tax treatment of any payment or benefits made under this Policy, and the Corporate Senior Officer shall be responsible in any event for any taxes or penalties due under federal or state tax laws due to payments or benefits provided hereunder.

Exhibit A 
  BENEFITS PROVIDED TO A CORPORATE SENIOR OFFICER WHO IS A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT 
    
  Severance Benefits upon Involuntary Termination Not In Connection with a Change in Control  . 
    
  In the event an eligible Senior Vice President experiences a Qualifying Termination other than in connection with a Change in Control, as provided for below, upon the Bank s receipt of an executed Severance Agreement and Release that has become irrevocable in accordance with its terms and Applicable Laws (but in any event not earlier than the Effective Date of Separation), the Senior Vice President will be entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal to the greater of: (a) twelve weeks of his/her base salary, or (b) the sum of (i) three weeks of his/her base salary, plus (ii) three weeks of his/her base salary for each full year of service at the Bank, and (iii) three weeks of his/her base salary prorated for each partial year of service.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total severance pay for any Senior Vice President (excluding the one week notice pay or pay in lieu of notice, if applicable) will not exceed twelve months base salary; provided, however, that the severance pay will in no event be paid later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which the Effective Date of Separation occurs.   
    
  To the extent permitted by the insurance carrier that provides life insurance to the Bank s employees, the Bank will continue life insurance coverage for the Senior Vice President for one month after the end of the month in which the Effective Date of Separation occurs.  The value of the life insurance benefits provided may be taxable income to the Senior Vice President  . 
    
  In addition, the Senior Vice President will be entitled to continued health insurance coverage under the Bank s health insurance policies for the first month immediately following the Effective Date of Separation, with the Bank paying one month s premium directly to the health insurance company. 
    
  Severance Benefits upon Involuntary Termination In Connection with a Change in Control  . 
    
  In the event an eligible Senior Vice President is involuntarily terminated without  Cause  or voluntarily terminates employment with  Good Reason  within ninety (90) calendar days prior to a  Change in Control  or during a one-year period following a Change in Control, upon the Bank s timely receipt of an executed Severance Agreement and Release that has become irrevocable in accordance with its terms and Applicable Laws (but in any event not earlier than the Effective Date of Separation or the Change in Control event), the Senior Vice President will receive severance pay in a lump sum equal to one year of base salary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the severance pay will not be paid later than 2-1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which the Effective Date of Separation occurs. 
  Exhibit A - Page 1 

To the extent permitted by the insurance carrier that provides life insurance to the Bank s employees, the Bank will continue life insurance coverage for the Senior Vice President for 12 months after the end of the month in which the Effective Date of Separation occurs. However, the Bank will immediately cease paying such premiums prior to the end of the 12-month period if the Senior Vice President accepts employment with another employer that provides a comparable benefit in terms of cost and scope of coverage during the 12-month period. 
    
  In addition, the Senior Vice President will be entitled to continued health insurance coverage under the Bank s health insurance policies at the Bank s expense for a period of 12 months beginning the first month immediately following the Effective Date of Separation, with the Bank paying premiums directly to the health insurance company.  However, the Bank will immediately cease paying such premiums prior to the end of the 12-month period if the Senior Vice President accepts employment with another employer that provides comparable benefits in terms of cost and scope of coverage during the 12-month period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that providing such health insurance coverage would be discriminatory pursuant to Section 105(h) of the Code or Section 2716 to the Public Health Service Act, then the Bank will provide such healthcare benefits, or a payment in lieu of such healthcare benefits, in a manner as determined in the Bank s sole discretion that would comply with applicable laws. 
    
  The value of the monthly health and life insurance benefits provided may be taxable income to the Senior Vice President  . 
    
  The Bank has no obligation to pay any severance payments or benefits if the Senior Vice President s employment is terminated by the Bank with Cause or by the Senior Vice President without Good Reason or the Senior Vice President s termination is due to death or Disability.  If the Change in Control severance payments or benefits are made to a Senior Vice President, he or she will not be eligible for the regular termination severance payments or benefits described above.   
    
  If a Senior Vice President becomes entitled to receive any severance payments or benefits pursuant to a Change in Control Agreement entered into by and between the Bank and such Senior Vice President, such Senior Vice President will not be eligible to receive any severance payments or benefits pursuant to the Policy.  No provisions of any such Change in Control Agreements will be superseded by this Policy, and any such Change in Control Agreements will otherwise remain in full force and effect. 
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Senior Vice President receives regular termination severance payments or benefits with respect to a Qualifying Termination, and subsequently becomes entitled to receive severance payments or benefits as a result of the occurrence of a Change in Control or pursuant to a Change in Control Agreement, the amount of the severance payments or benefits payable as a result of the termination occurring in connection with a Change in Control will be automatically reduced by the benefits and payments already received by the Senior Vice President as severance pursuant to this Policy. 
  Exhibit A - Page 2  

Definitions  .  
    
   Cause  means (i) the commission of an act of fraud or embezzlement by the Senior Vice President that has a material adverse impact on the Bank or any successor or affiliate thereof, (ii) a conviction of, or plea of  guilty  or  no contest  to, a felony by the Senior Vice President, (iii) the Senior Vice President s ongoing and repeated failure or refusal to perform or neglect of his or her duties to the Bank in a material respect, which failure, refusal, or neglect continues for fifteen (15) calendar days following the Senior Vice President s receipt of written notice from the Bank s Board of Directors stating with specificity the nature of such failure, refusal, or neglect, or (iv) the Senior Vice President engaging in conduct that has resulted in the Senior Vice President being barred from employment by the Bank by operation of any law or regulation, or by any final order of any court or regulatory authority or any agreement with any regulatory authority, including, without limitation, any removal or barring of employment of the Senior Vice President pursuant to 12 USC    4615, 4616, 4617 or 4636a, or any of their successor sections or provisions.  The Bank shall make the determination that  Cause  exists in good faith and only if and when the determination has been approved in good faith by the Bank s Board of Directors; provided, however, that prior to a final determination that Cause exists, the Bank will (y) provide to the Senior Vice President in writing, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the determination that such  Cause  exists, and (z) provide the Senior Vice President with an opportunity to discuss the determination that  Cause  exists with the Board prior to the final decision to terminate the Senior Vice President s employment hereunder for such  Cause.

However, none of the foregoing events or conditions will constitute Good Reason unless: (x) the Senior Vice President provides the Bank with written objection to the event or condition within ninety (90) calendar days following the occurrence thereof, (y) the Bank does not reverse or otherwise fully cure the event or condition within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving that written objection, and (z) the Senior Vice President resigns his or her employment within thirty (30) calendar days following the expiration of that cure period.

 BOARD RESOLUTION FOR 2017 BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPENSATION AND EXPENSE REIMBURSEM

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 10.2 
    
  FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO 
    
  RESOLUTION 
    
  September 30, 2016 

RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco hereby approves the 2017 Board of Directors Compensation and Expense Reimbursement Policy, as set forth in Exhibit K. 

I certify that this is a true and correct copy of a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco at its meeting on September 30, 2016. 
        
      /s/ Suzanne Titus-Johnson 
      Suzanne Titus-Johnson, Senior Vice President and  
  General Counsel-Corporate Secretary 

EXHIBIT K 
    
  FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO 
    
  Board of Directors 
  Compensation and Expense Reimbursement Policy 
  2017 

The Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco hereby establishes the following Compensation and Expense Reimbursement Policy for 2017. 
    
  Compensation 
    
  To provide the Directors with reasonable compensation for the performance of their duties as members of the Board of Directors and the amount of time spent on official Bank business, the Bank will pay service and meeting fees to each member of the Board of Directors in accordance with the applicable position held by the Director     as set forth below.  

In determining Total Maximum Annual Compensation, the Board considered compensation levels and practices at other Federal Home Loan Banks, the   Directors Compensation Analysis May 2015   report prepared by McLagan, and trends in the financial services market generally. 
    
  Service Fees 
    
  Service fees for the above positions compensate Directors for their continuous service as Bank directors, including for their time attending special Board and Committee meetings held during the year as needed, preparing for Board and Committee meetings,  
  reviewing materials sent periodically between meetings, attending Director training and educational briefings, and all other activities outside the regularly scheduled two-day Board and Committee meetings, which may include attending Affordable Housing Advisory Council and Federal Home Loan Bank System meetings. Directors are expected to attend all Board meetings and meetings of the Committees on which they serve, and to remain engaged and actively participate in all meetings. 

The maximum annual service fee will be pro-rated and paid with the meeting fee, if applicable, at the conclusion of each two-month service period on the Board of Directors (i.e., month-end February, April, June, August, October and December). A Director will not be paid the final two-month service fee for the year if the Director has not attended (in person or by telephone) at least 75% of all regular and special meetings of the Board and the Committees on which the Director served during the year (adjusted as needed for partial year service), or if the Board, in its discretion, determines at any time that the Director has consistently demonstrated a lack of engagement and participation in meetings attended. 
    
  If a Director holds more than one position on the Board, during any applicable payment period, the Director s service fee for that period will be calculated based on the position that pays the highest service fee, and will be pro-rated for the number of days the Director held that position during the applicable payment period. Any Director who joins or leaves the Board between service fee payments will receive a pro rata service fee for the number of days the Director was on the Board during the service period.  
    
  Meeting Fees 
    
  Each Director will receive a meeting fee of $9,500 for attending any portion of five of the six regularly scheduled two-day Board and Committee meetings, so long as the Director s attendance includes the Board meeting and at least one Committee on which the Director serves. A Director may receive a meeting fee for participation in one regularly-scheduled Board and Committee meeting by telephone.  
    
  No meeting fee will be paid for participation in special meetings of the Board or Committees (in person or by telephone) or for participation in other Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank System activities.  
    
  The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank is authorized to interpret this Policy, as necessary, according to applicable statutory, regulatory and policy limits.  
    
  Expense Reimbursement 
    
  The Bank will reimburse Directors for necessary and reasonable travel, subsistence and other related expenses incurred in connection with the performance of their official duties, which may include participation in meetings or activities for which no fee is paid. 
    
  For expense reimbursement purposes, Directors   official duties  include:  
    
           1) 
    Meetings of the Board and Board Committees 
              2) 
    Meetings requested by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and Federal Home Loan Bank System Committees 
     3)    Meetings of the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks and its Committees

6) 
    Other events attended on behalf of the Bank with the prior approval of the Chair 
              7)

  Each Director is responsible for making his or her own travel arrangements to attend meetings and other events for which expenses may be reimbursed. 
    
  Expenses reimbursable for Directors are the same as the expenses reimbursable for senior officers under the Bank s Reimbursement and Travel Expense Policy, except that Directors may not be reimbursed for gift or entertainment expenses. 
    
  To be reimbursed for allowable expenses, a Director must submit the related receipts to the Bank, itemizing the expenses, within 30 days of completion of any covered trip or activity, and must include the following information: 
    
           1) 
    Meeting(s) or event(s) attended, with dates and locations

The opportunity for approved guests to accompany Directors to the meeting and attend group dinners/meals/functions contributes to and enhances collegiality among the Board members and management, and their attendance is considered important and reasonable.  
    
  The cost of approved guests  travel and meals paid (or reimbursed) by the Bank may be considered by the IRS to be taxable income and will appear on Directors  Form 1099.    
    
  Records 
    
  The Bank will maintain records of (i) Directors  attendance at meetings of the Board and Board committees; (ii) total compensation paid; and (iii) expenses reimbursed. The Bank will report this information to the Federal Housing Finance Agency as required.
