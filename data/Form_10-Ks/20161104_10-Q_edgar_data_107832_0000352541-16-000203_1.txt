  COMBINED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  NOTE 1(a) General -   The interim unaudited Financial Statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, although management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  These Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the latest combined Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which unless otherwise noted are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made.  Results for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  A change in management s estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such change occurred.  Certain prior period amounts in the Financial Statements and Notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation for comparative purposes.  Unless otherwise noted, the Notes herein exclude discontinued operations for all periods presented.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, IPL and WPL implemented a change in method of recording income taxes that impacts the separate financial statements of IPL and WPL.  As discussed in    Note 6   , all Alliant Energy share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a   two  -for-one common stock split distributed in May 2016.  As required by GAAP, all prior period financial statements and disclosures presented herein have been restated to reflect the tax method change and common stock split. 
    
  NOTE 1(b) New Accounting Standards - 
  Revenue Recognition   -   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard providing principles for recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers with the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  This standard also requires disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently expect to adopt this standard on January 1, 2018 and are evaluating the impact of this standard on their financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Leases   -   In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard requiring lease assets and lease liabilities, including operating leases, to be recognized on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  The standard also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are required to adopt this standard on January 1, 2019 and are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on their financial condition and results of operations.  Early adoption of this standard is permitted.

NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS 
  Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities   - 
  Regulatory assets were comprised of the following items (in millions): 

Regulatory liabilities were comprised of the following items (in millions): 

Tax-related     -   Alliant Energy s and IPL s tax-related regulatory assets are generally impacted by certain property-related differences at IPL for which deferred tax is not recorded in the income statement pursuant to Iowa rate-making principles.  Deferred tax amounts for such property-related differences at IPL are recorded to regulatory assets, along with the necessary revenue requirement tax gross-ups.  During the   nine months ended September 30  ,   2016  , Alliant Energy s and IPL s tax-related regulatory assets increased primarily due to property-related differences for qualifying repair expenditures. 
    
  Derivatives -   Refer to    Note 12    for discussion of derivative assets and derivative liabilities. 
    
  IPL s tax benefit riders -   IPL s tax benefit riders utilize regulatory liabilities to credit bills of IPL s Iowa retail electric and gas customers to help offset the impact of rate increases on such customers.  These regulatory liabilities are related to tax benefits from tax accounting method changes for repairs expenditures, allocation of mixed service costs, allocation of insurance proceeds from floods in 2008, and cost of removal expenditures.  For the   nine months ended September 30  ,   2016  , Alliant Energy s and IPL s  IPL s tax benefit riders  regulatory liabilities decreased by   $56 million   as follows (in millions): 
                     Electric tax benefit rider credits

  Utility Rate Cases   - 
  WPL s Wisconsin Retail Electric and Gas Rate Case (2017/2018 Test Period) -   In May 2016, WPL filed a retail base rate case with the PSCW based on a forward-looking test period that includes 2017 and 2018.  WPL s filing was based on a stipulated agreement reached between PSCW staff, intervener groups and WPL.  The filing requested approval for WPL to implement a   $13 million  , or approximately   1%  , increase in annual rates for WPL s retail electric customers.  The net requested increase for 2017 compared to WPL s retail electric rate case for the 2015/2016 Test Period reflected a   $65 million   increase in base rates, partially offset by a   $52 million   reduction in fuel-related costs, using a preliminary estimate for 2017 fuel-related costs.  The filing also requested approval for WPL to implement a   $9 million  , or approximately   13%  , increase in  

Table of Contents  

annual base rates for WPL s retail gas customers.  Any rate changes granted from this request are expected to be effective January 1, 2017 and extend through the end of 2018.  WPL currently expects a decision from the PSCW regarding this base rate case filing in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  IPL s Iowa Retail Electric Rate Settlement Agreement -   The IUB approved a settlement agreement in 2014 related to rates charged to IPL s Iowa retail electric customers.  The settlement agreement extends IPL s Iowa retail electric base rates authorized in its 2009 Test Year rate case through 2016 and provides targeted retail electric customer billing credits.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30  , IPL recorded billing credits to reduce retail electric customers  bills as follows (in millions): 

WPL s Retail Fuel-related Rate Filing (2016 Test Year) -   Pursuant to a 2015 PSCW order, WPL s 2016 fuel-related costs will be subject to deferral if they are outside an annual bandwidth of plus or minus   2%   of the approved annual forecasted fuel-related costs.  Retail fuel-related costs incurred by WPL through September 30, 2016 were lower than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period resulting in an over-collection of fuel-related costs.  As of September 30, 2016, fuel-related costs outside of the approved range were   $9 million   and are included in  Commodity cost recovery  in Alliant Energy s and WPL s regulatory liabilities table above. 
    
  WPL s Retail Fuel-related Rate Filing (2015 Test Year) -   Pursuant to a 2014 PSCW order, WPL s 2015 fuel-related costs were subject to deferral since they were outside an annual bandwidth of plus or minus   2%   of the approved annual forecasted fuel-related costs.  Retail fuel-related costs incurred by WPL in 2015 were lower than fuel-related costs used to determine rates for such period resulting in an over-collection of fuel-related costs.  Pursuant to an August 2016 PSCW order, WPL will refund $  10 million  , including interest, to its retail electric customers in the fourth quarter of 2016 for these over-collections. 

NOTE 3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
  Utility   - 
  Emission Controls Project - 
  WPL s Edgewater Unit 5   - Construction of the scrubber and baghouse at Edgewater Unit 5 was completed in July 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Alliant Energy and WPL recorded capitalized expenditures of   $223 million   and AFUDC of   $12 million   for the scrubber and baghouse in  Property, plant and equipment, net  on their balance sheets. 
    
  Natural Gas-Fired Generation Project - 
  IPL s Marshalltown Generating Station   - IPL is currently constructing Marshalltown, an approximate   650   MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle EGU.  Construction began in 2014 and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Alliant Energy and IPL recorded capitalized expenditures for construction work in progress of   $600 million   and AFUDC of   $56 million   for Marshalltown in  Property, plant and equipment, net  on their balance sheets. 
    
  Sales of IPL s Minnesota Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Assets -   In 2015, IPL completed the sale of its Minnesota natural gas distribution assets and received proceeds of   $11 million   and a promissory note of   $2 million  .  In 2015, IPL completed the sale of its Minnesota electric distribution assets and received proceeds of   $129 million  .  The proceeds from the natural gas distribution assets were used for general corporate purposes and the proceeds from the electric distribution assets were used to reduce cash amounts received from IPL s sales of accounts receivable program.  The premium received over the book value of the property, plant and equipment sold was more than offset by a reduction in tax-related regulatory assets associated with the distribution assets.  As a result, Alliant Energy and IPL recorded pre-tax charges of   $9 million   and   $3 million   for the Minnesota electric and natural gas distribution asset transactions, respectively, in  Other operation and maintenance  in their income statements for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Non-regulated and Other   - 
  Non-regulated Generation - 
  Franklin County Wind Farm   - Based on an evaluation of the strategic options for the Franklin County wind farm performed in the third quarter of 2016, Alliant Energy concluded, as of September 30, 2016, it was probable the Franklin County wind farm will be transferred to IPL.  As a result, Alliant Energy performed an impairment analysis of such assets in the third quarter of 2016.  The impairment analysis evaluated the value of the assets and a reasonable estimate of the amount of costs associated with the Franklin County wind farm that would be allowed for recovery for IPL s electric rate-making purposes.  Based on various analyses, including discounted cash flows projected from the Franklin County wind farm, recently executed purchased power agreements associated with wind generating facilities located near the Franklin County wind farm, and the  

Table of Contents  

cost of new wind farms identified through IPL s planned wind expansion, the current value of the Franklin County wind farm assets as of September 30, 2016 was determined to be approximately   $33 million  , subject to working capital adjustments.  Alliant Energy concluded such value represents a reasonable estimate of the amount IPL will be allowed for recovery for IPL s electric rate-making purposes.  As a result, the carrying amount of the Franklin County wind farm was reduced to its current value, resulting in non-cash, pre-tax asset valuation charges of   $86 million   (after-tax charges of   $51 million  , or   $0.23   per share) in the third quarter of 2016.  Alliant Energy recorded such charges as a reduction to  Property, plant and equipment, net  on its balance sheet in 2016 and charges to  Asset valuation charges for Franklin County wind farm  in its income statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  IPL currently anticipates requesting approval from FERC in the fourth quarter of 2016 to transfer the Franklin County wind farm to IPL and expects to complete such transfer in the first quarter of 2017.    The final amount to be recovered for IPL s electric rate-making purposes will be determined by the IUB as part of IPL s Iowa retail electric rate case for the 2016 Test Year, currently anticipated to be filed in the second quarter of 2017, and therefore the final asset valuation charges are subject to change.

Swap, option and physical forward commodity contracts were non-exchange-based derivative instruments and were valued using indicative price quotations from a pricing vendor that provides daily exchange forward price settlements, from broker or dealer quotations, from market publications or from on-line exchanges.  The indicative price quotations reflected the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices and were obtained from sources believed to provide the most liquid market for the commodity.  A portion of these indicative price quotations were corroborated using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and categorized derivative instruments based on such indicative price quotations as Level 2.  Commodity contracts that were valued using indicative price quotations based on significant assumptions such as seasonal or monthly shaping and indicative price quotations that could not be readily corroborated were categorized as Level 3.  Swap, option and physical forward commodity contracts were predominately at liquid trading points.  FTRs were valued using monthly or annual auction shadow prices from relevant auctions and were categorized as Level 3.  Refer to    Note 12    for additional details of derivative assets and derivative liabilities. 
    
  The fair value measurements of Level 3 derivative instruments include observable and unobservable inputs.  The observable inputs are obtained from third-party pricing sources, counterparties and brokers and include bids, offers, historical transactions (including historical price differences between locations with both observable and unobservable prices) and executed trades.  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of commodity contracts are forecasted electricity, natural gas and coal prices, and the expected volatility of such prices.  Significant changes in any of those inputs would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. 
    
  Deferred proceeds (sales of receivables) -   The fair value of IPL s deferred proceeds related to its sales of accounts receivable program was calculated each reporting date using the cost approach valuation technique.  The fair value represents the carrying amount of receivables sold less the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with the receivables sold and cash amounts received from the receivables sold due to the short-term nature of the collection period.  These inputs were considered unobservable and deferred proceeds were categorized as Level 3.  Deferred proceeds represent IPL s maximum exposure to loss related to the receivables sold.  Refer to    Note 4    for additional information regarding deferred proceeds. 
    
  Long-term debt (including current maturities) -   The fair value of long-term debt instruments was based on quoted market prices for similar liabilities at each reporting date or on a discounted cash flow methodology, which utilizes assumptions of current market pricing curves at each reporting date.  Refer to    Note 7(b)    for additional information regarding long-term debt. 
    
  Cumulative preferred stock -   The fair value of IPL s   5.1%   cumulative preferred stock was based on its closing market price quoted by the New York Stock Exchange at each reporting date.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   - The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of such financial instruments.  Carrying amounts and related estimated fair values of other financial instruments were as follows (in millions): 

Unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments are generally recorded with offsets to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities, based on fuel and natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, as well as other specific regulatory authorizations.  Based on these recovery mechanisms, the changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities resulted in comparable changes to regulatory assets, and the changes in the fair value of derivative assets resulted in comparable changes to regulatory liabilities.

    Settlements related to deferred proceeds are due to the change in the carrying amount of receivables sold less the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with the receivables sold and cash proceeds received from the receivables sold. 
       
  Commodity Contracts -   The fair value of electric, natural gas and coal commodity contracts categorized as Level 3 was recognized as net derivative assets (liabilities) as follows (in millions): 

NOTE 12. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
  Commodity Derivatives   - 
  Purpose -   Derivative instruments are periodically used for risk management purposes to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in certain commodity prices and transmission congestion costs.  Refer to    Note 11    for detailed discussion of derivative instruments. 
    
  Notional Amounts -   As of   September 30, 2016  , gross notional amounts and settlement/delivery years related to outstanding swap contracts, option contracts, physical forward contracts, FTRs, coal contracts and diesel fuel contracts that were accounted for as commodity derivative instruments were as follows (units in thousands): 

Table of Contents  

Financial Statement Presentation -   Derivative instruments are recorded at fair value each reporting date on the balance sheets as assets or liabilities.  The fair values of current derivative assets are included in  Other current assets,  non-current derivative assets are included in  Deferred charges and other,  current derivative liabilities are included in  Other current liabilities  and non-current derivative liabilities are included in  Other liabilities  on the balance sheets as follows (in millions): 

Unrealized gains and losses from commodity derivative instruments were recorded with offsets to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheets.  Refer to Notes    2    and    11    for further discussion. 
    
  Credit Risk-related Contingent Features -   Various agreements contain credit risk-related contingent features, including requirements to maintain certain credit ratings and/or limitations on liability positions under the agreements based on credit ratings.  Certain of these agreements with credit risk-related contingency features are accounted for as derivative instruments.  In the event of a material change in creditworthiness or if liability positions exceed certain contractual limits, credit support may need to be provided in the form of letters of credit or cash collateral up to the amount of exposure under the contracts, or the contracts may need to be unwound and underlying liability positions paid.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was not materially different than amounts that would be required to be posted as credit support to counterparties by Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL if the most restrictive credit risk-related contingent features for derivative agreements in a net liability position were triggered. 
    
  Balance Sheet Offsetting   - The fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement are not netted by counterparty on the balance sheets.  However, if the fair value amounts of derivative instruments by counterparty were netted, amounts would not be materially different from gross amounts of derivative assets and derivative liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (payable) are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. 

NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  NOTE 13(a) Capital Purchase Obligations -   Various contractual obligations contain minimum future commitments related to capital expenditures for certain construction projects.  IPL s projects include the installation of an SCR system at Ottumwa Unit 1 to reduce NOx emissions at the EGU.  WPL s projects include the Riverside expansion, the installation of an SCR system at Columbia Unit 2 to reduce NOx emissions at the EGU, and generation maintenance and performance improvements at Columbia Units 1 and 2.  At   September 30, 2016  , Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s minimum future commitments related to certain contractual obligations for these projects were   $27 million  ,   $1 million   and   $26 million  , respectively. 
    
  NOTE 13(b) Operating Expense Purchase Obligations -   Various commodity supply, transportation and storage contracts help meet obligations to provide electricity and natural gas to utility customers.  Other operating expense purchase obligations with various vendors provide other goods and services.  At   September 30, 2016  , minimum future commitments related to these operating expense purchase obligations were as follows (in millions): 

Table of Contents  

(a) 
    Includes payments required by purchased power agreements for capacity rights and minimum quantities of MWhs required to be purchased. 
              (b) 
    Corporate Services entered into system-wide coal contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL that include minimum future commitments.  These commitments were assigned to IPL and WPL based on information available as of   September 30, 2016   regarding expected future usage, which is subject to change. 
              (c) 
    Includes individual commitments incurred during the normal course of business that exceeded   $1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  NOTE 13(c) Legal Proceedings - 
  Flood Damage Claims   -   In 2013, several plaintiffs purporting to represent a class of residential and commercial property owners filed a complaint against CRANDIC, Alliant Energy and various other defendants in the Iowa District Court for Linn County.  Plaintiffs assert claims of negligence and strict liability based on their allegations that CRANDIC (along with other defendants) caused or exacerbated flooding of the Cedar River in June 2008.  In February 2016, the Iowa District Court for Linn County ruled in favor of Alliant Energy and CRANDIC and dismissed all claims against them, resulting in no loss.  In August 2016, the Iowa District Court for Linn County dismissed all claims against the remaining defendants.  In September 2016, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Iowa.  Alliant Energy does not currently believe any material losses for this complaint are both probable and reasonably estimated, and therefore has not recognized any material loss contingency amounts as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  NOTE 13(d) Guarantees and Indemnifications - 
  RMT   -   In 2013, Alliant Energy sold RMT.  RMT provided renewable energy services, including construction and high voltage connection services for wind and solar projects.  As part of the sale, Alliant Energy indemnified the buyer for any claims, including claims of warranty under the project obligations that were commenced or are based on actions that occurred prior to the sale, except for liabilities already accounted for through adjustments to the purchase price.  The indemnification obligations either cease to exist when the statute of limitation for such claims is met or, in the case of RMT s projects, when the warranty period under the agreements expires.  The contractual warranty periods for RMT s projects generally range from   12   to   60   months with the latest expiring in 2016.  Limited warranties may be extended in certain cases for warranty work performed. 
    
  Alliant Energy also continues to guarantee RMT s performance obligations related to certain of RMT s projects that were commenced prior to Alliant Energy s sale of RMT.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Alliant Energy had   $123 million   of performance guarantees outstanding, with   $48 million   and   $75 million   currently expected to expire in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  The expiration of these performance guarantees may be extended depending on when all valid warranty claims are resolved for the respective projects. 
    
  Although Alliant Energy has received warranty claims related to certain of these projects, it does not currently believe that material losses are both probable and reasonably estimated, and therefore, has not recognized any material liabilities related to these matters as of   September 30, 2016  .  Alliant Energy does not currently believe that the range of future potential loss from any warranty claims will be material.  Refer to    Note 16    for further discussion of RMT, including amounts Alliant Energy recorded to  Operating expenses  during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 related to certain warranty claims. 
    
  Whiting Petroleum   -   In 2004, Alliant Energy sold its remaining interest in Whiting Petroleum.  Whiting Petroleum is an independent oil and gas company.  Resources, as the successor to a predecessor entity that owned Whiting Petroleum, continues to guarantee the partnership obligations of an affiliate of Whiting Petroleum under general partnership agreements in the oil and gas industry, including with respect to the future abandonment of certain platforms off the coast of California and related onshore plant and equipment owned by the partnerships.  The guarantees do not include a maximum limit.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the present value of the abandonment obligations is estimated at   $30 million  .  Alliant Energy is not aware of any material liabilities related to these guarantees of which it is probable that Resources will be obligated to pay and therefore has not recognized any material liabilities related to this guarantee as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  IPL s Minnesota Electric Distribution Assets   -   IPL provided indemnifications associated with the July 2015 sale of its Minnesota electric distribution assets for losses resulting from potential breach of IPL s representations, warranties and obligations under the sale agreement.  Alliant Energy and IPL believe the likelihood of having to make any material cash payments under these indemnifications is remote.  IPL has not recorded any material liabilities related to these indemnifications as of   September 30, 2016  .  The general terms of the indemnifications provided by IPL included a maximum limit of   $17 million   and expire in   October 2020  .

NOTE 13(e) Environmental Matters - 
  MGP Sites   -   IPL and WPL have current or previous ownership interests in various sites that are previously associated with the production of gas for which IPL and WPL have, or may have in the future, liability for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs.  IPL and WPL are working pursuant to the requirements of various federal and state agencies to investigate, mitigate, prevent and remediate, where necessary, the environmental impacts to property, including natural resources, at and around these former MGP sites in order to protect public health and the environment.  IPL and WPL are currently monitoring and/or remediating   23   and   5   sites, respectively. 
    
  Environmental liabilities related to the MGP sites are recorded based upon periodic studies.  Such amounts are based on the best current estimate of the remaining amount to be incurred for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs for those sites where the investigation process has been or is substantially completed, and the minimum of the estimated cost range for those sites where the investigation is in its earlier stages.  There are inherent uncertainties associated with the estimated remaining costs for MGP projects primarily due to unknown site conditions and potential changes in regulatory agency requirements.  It is possible that future cost estimates will be greater than current estimates as the investigation process proceeds and as additional facts become known.  The amounts recognized as liabilities are reduced for expenditures incurred and are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change.  Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted.  At   September 30, 2016  , estimated future costs expected to be incurred for the investigation, remediation and monitoring of the MGP sites, as well as environmental liabilities recorded on the balance sheets for these sites, were as follows (in millions): 

WPL Consent Decree   -   In 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin approved a Consent Decree that WPL, along with the other owners of Edgewater and Columbia, entered into with the EPA and the Sierra Club, thereby resolving claims against WPL.  Such claims included allegations that the owners of Edgewater, Nelson Dewey and Columbia violated the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program requirements, Title V Operating Permit requirements of the CAA and the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan designed to implement the CAA. 
    
  WPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree.  WPL s remaining requirements include installing an SCR system at Columbia Unit 2 by December 31, 2018.  WPL is also required to fuel switch or retire Edgewater Unit 4 by December 31, 2018.  In addition, the Consent Decree establishes emission rate limits for SO2, NOx and particulate matter for Columbia Units 1 and 2, and Edgewater Units 4 and 5.  The Consent Decree also includes annual plant-wide emission caps for SO2 and NOx for Columbia and Edgewater.  WPL is in the process of completing approximately   $7 million   in environmental mitigation projects. 
    
  Alliant Energy and WPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by WPL related to compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree from WPL s electric customers.  The recovery of such costs will be decided by the PSCW in future rate cases or other proceedings. 
    
  IPL Consent Decree   - In 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa approved a Consent Decree that IPL entered into with the EPA, the Sierra Club, the State of Iowa and Linn County in Iowa, thereby resolving potential CAA issues associated with emissions from IPL s coal-fired generating facilities in Iowa.  IPL has completed various requirements under the Consent Decree.  IPL s remaining requirements include installing an SCR system or equivalent NOx reduction system at the Ottumwa Generating Station by December 31, 2019; fuel switching or retiring Prairie Creek Unit 4 by June 1, 2018, the Burlington Generating Station by December 31, 2021 and Prairie Creek Units 1 and 3 by December 31, 2025; and either installing combined cycle technology at, or retiring, the Dubuque and Sutherland Generating Stations by June 1, 2019. 
    
  The Consent Decree also establishes SO2, NOx and particulate matter emission rate limits with varying averaging times for the Burlington, Lansing, M.L. Kapp, Ottumwa and Prairie Creek Generating Stations.  In addition, the Consent Decree includes calendar-year SO2 and NOx emission caps for the Prairie Creek Generating Station, and calendar-year SO2 and NOx emission caps in aggregate for the Burlington, Dubuque, Lansing, M.L. Kapp, Ottumwa, Prairie Creek and Sutherland Generating Stations.  IPL will also complete approximately   $6 million   in environmental mitigation projects.

Alliant Energy and IPL currently expect to recover material costs incurred by IPL related to the environmental control systems and environmental mitigation projects from IPL s electric customers.  The recovery of such costs will be decided by IPL s regulators in future rate cases or other proceedings. 
    
  Other Environmental Contingencies   -   In addition to the environmental liabilities discussed above, various environmental rules are monitored that may have a significant impact on future operations.  Several of these environmental rules are subject to legal challenges, reconsideration and/or other uncertainties.  Given uncertainties regarding the outcome, timing and compliance plans for these environmental matters, the complete financial impact of each of these rules is not able to be determined; however future capital investments and/or modifications to EGUs to comply with certain of these rules could be significant.  Specific current, proposed or potential environmental matters include, among others: Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, Ozone NAAQS Rule, Federal Clean Water Act including Section 316(b), Effluent Limitation Guidelines, Hydroelectric Fish Passage Device, CCR Rule, and various legislation and EPA regulations to monitor and regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon emissions from new (CAA Section 111(b)) and existing (CAA Section 111(d)) fossil-fueled EGUs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
    
  Description of Business 
  General -   Alliant Energy is an investor-owned public utility holding company whose primary subsidiaries are IPL, WPL, AEF and Corporate Services.  IPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas to retail customers in select markets in Iowa.  IPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa.  WPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas to retail customers in select markets in Wisconsin.  WPL also sells electricity to wholesale customers in Wisconsin.  At   September 30, 2016  , WPL and Resources, through their ownership interests in WPL Transco, LLC, in aggregate held an approximate 16% ownership interest in ATC, a transmission-only utility operating primarily in the Midwest.  Effective October 1, 2016, AEF is the parent company for Alliant Energy s non-regulated businesses.  Corporate Services provides administrative services to Alliant Energy and its subsidiaries.  An illustration of Alliant Energy s primary businesses is shown below.

Financial Results   -   Alliant Energy s net income and EPS attributable to Alliant Energy common shareowners for the   third   quarter were as follows (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): 

(a) 
    Amounts reflect the effects of a two-for-one common stock split distributed in May 2016.  Refer to    Note 6    for additional details. 
       
  The table above includes EPS from continuing operations for utilities, ATC and Corporate Services, and non-regulated and parent, which are non-GAAP financial measures.  Alliant Energy believes EPS from continuing operations for utilities, ATC and Corporate Services, and non-regulated and parent are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends and provide additional information about Alliant Energy s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. 
    
  Lower net income and EPS from continuing operations in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   was primarily due to asset valuation charges related to the Franklin County wind farm in the third quarter of 2016, timing of income tax expense, higher reserves for ATC return on equity at WPL, and higher stock-based performance compensation expense.  These items were partially offset by estimated temperature impacts on retail electric and gas sales in the third quarter of 2016, higher AFUDC, and voluntary employee separation charges in the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Refer to     Results of Operations     for additional details regarding the various factors impacting earnings during the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015  . 
    
  2016 Overview   - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL continue to focus on achieving financial objectives and executing their strategic plan, including providing competitive value and exceptional service for their customers and finding innovative ways to operate the business more efficiently and provide flexible energy resources.  Key developments since the filing of the   2015   Form 10-K include the following: 
             
    IPL s Expansion of Wind Generation -   In October 2016, IPL and the Iowa Office of Consumer Advocate, among other customer groups, filed a settlement agreement with the IUB regarding the appropriate rate-making principles for up to 500 MW of additional wind generation at IPL.  In October 2016, the IUB issued an order approving the settlement agreement, with limited modifications, and establishing rate-making principles, which IPL accepted, with key terms as follows.  Refer to     Strategic Overview     for further discussion. 
                
    Up to 500 MW of additional wind generation that qualifies for the full level of production tax credits, regardless of the location in Iowa, with a cost cap of $1,830/kilowatt, including AFUDC and transmission costs.  Any costs incurred in excess of this $1,830/kilowatt cost cap are expected to be incorporated into rates if determined to be reasonable and prudent. 
                
    A depreciable life of the wind generation of 40 years, unless changed as a result of a contested case before the IUB. 
                
    An 11.0% return on common equity, with the exception of certain transmission facilities classified as intangible assets, which would earn the rate of return on common equity the IUB finds reasonable during a future rate case. 
                
    Franklin County Wind Farm -   In addition to IPL s expansion of wind generation discussed above, IPL currently anticipates requesting approval from FERC in the fourth quarter of 2016 to transfer the 99 MW Franklin County wind farm from AEF to IPL in 2017. 
                
    IPL s and WPL s Potential Expansion of Wind Generation   -   In addition to IPL s 500 MW expansion of wind generation and planned transfer of the 99 MW Franklin County wind farm to IPL in 2017 discussed above, IPL and WPL are exploring options to own and operate up to 400 MW of additional new wind generation in aggregate. 
                
    WPL s Construction of the Riverside Expansion   - In May 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW authorizing WPL to construct a natural gas-fired combined-cycle EGU in Beloit, Wisconsin, referred to as the Riverside expansion.  After receiving the final necessary regulatory approvals and permits in the third quarter of 2016, WPL began constructing the Riverside expansion.  WPL currently expects to place the Riverside expansion in service by early 2020.  In November 2016, various electric cooperatives notified WPL of their intent to exercise their options to acquire approximately 60 MW of the Riverside expansion while the EGU is being constructed.  As a result of the various electric

cooperatives funding a portion of the capital expenditures during construction, WPL s estimated portion of capital expenditures is now expected to be approximately $640 million. 
             
    WPL s Wisconsin Retail Electric and Gas Rate Case (2017/2018 Test Period) -   In May 2016, WPL filed a retail base rate case with the PSCW based on a forward-looking test period that includes 2017 and 2018.  WPL s filing was based on a stipulated agreement reached between PSCW staff, intervener groups and WPL.  The filing requested approval for WPL to implement a $13 million, or approximately 1%, increase in annual rates for WPL s retail electric customers.  Based on updated fuel-related cost information at the time of rate case hearings in September 2016, the current estimate of the net increase in annual rates for WPL s retail electric customers is $17 million.  The filing also requested approval for WPL to implement a $9 million, or approximately 13%, increase in annual base rates for WPL s retail gas customers.  Any rate changes granted from this request are expected to be effective January 1, 2017 and extend through the end of 2018.    WPL currently expects a decision from the PSCW regarding this base rate filing in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
                
    MISO Transmission Owner Return on Equity Complaints -   A group of MISO cooperative and municipal utilities previously filed two complaints with FERC requesting a reduction to the base return on equity used by MISO transmission owners, including ITC and ATC.  In September 2016, FERC issued an order on the first complaint and established a base return on equity of 10.32%, excluding any incentive adders granted by FERC, for the refund period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015.  In October 2016, in response to MISO s and the MISO transmission owners  request, FERC ordered the related refunds be issued by July 2017.      In June 2016, a FERC administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the second complaint and recommended a base return on equity of 9.70%, excluding any incentive adders granted by FERC, for the refund period from February 12, 2015 through May 11, 2016.  A final decision from FERC on the second complaint is currently expected in the first half of 2017.    
                
    WPL s Future Transfer of Investment in ATC -   In June 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW requiring WPL to transfer its investment in ATC to Alliant Energy or an Alliant Energy subsidiary by December 31, 2022.  In addition, WPL is required to obtain PSCW approval prior to transferring any additional capital or assets to ATC.      Subsequent to WPL transferring its investment in ATC, future contributions to, and equity earnings and dividends from, the investment in ATC would occur at the entity to which the investment in ATC was transferred and would not be reflected in WPL s consolidated financial statements.  As a result, WPL s earnings and cash flows from operations are expected to decrease subsequent to the transfer.  This transfer is not expected to impact Alliant Energy s consolidated financial statements. 
                
    Credit Ratings -   In July 2016, Moody s Investors Service changed Alliant Energy s and IPL s corporate/issuer and senior unsecured long-term debt credit ratings from A3 to Baa1.  IPL s preferred stock credit rating also changed from Baa2 to Baa3.  In addition, WPL s corporate/issuer and senior unsecured long-term debt credit ratings changed from A1 to A2.  Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s outlooks also changed from negative to stable.  Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s commercial paper ratings remained unchanged.  These credit ratings changes are not expected to have a material impact on Alliant Energy s, IPL s, and WPL s liquidity or collateral obligations. 
                
    Common Stock Split     -     In April 2016, Alliant Energy s Board of Directors approved a two  -for-one   common stock split and a proportionate increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock of Alliant Energy from 240 million shares to 480 million shares to implement the stock split.  Alliant Energy shareowners of record at the close of business on May 4, 2016 received one additional share of Alliant Energy common stock for each share held on that date.  The proportionate interest that a shareowner owns in Alliant Energy did not change as a result of the stock split.  The additional shares were distributed on May 19, 2016 and post-split trading began on May 20, 2016.  All Alliant Energy share and per share amounts in this report have been reflected on a post-split basis. 
       
  Future Developments   - The following includes key items expected to impact Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL in the future that have been identified since the filing of the   2015   Form 10-K: 
    
  2017 Forecast -   In 2017, the following financing activities, and impacts to results of operations, are currently anticipated to occur: 
             
    Financing Plans -   Alliant Energy currently expects to issue up to $150 million of common stock in 2017 through one or more offerings and its Shareowner Direct Plan.  IPL and WPL currently expect to receive capital contributions of approximately $150 million and $90 million, respectively, from their parent company, Alliant Energy, in 2017.  IPL and WPL currently expect to issue up to $250 million and $300 million, respectively, of long-term debt securities in 2017. 
                
    Common Stock Dividends -   Alliant Energy announced an increase in its targeted 2017 annual common stock dividend to $1.26 per share, which is equivalent to a quarterly rate of $0.315 per share, beginning with the February 2017 dividend payment.  The timing and amount of future dividends is subject to an approved dividend declaration from Alliant Energy s Board of Directors, and is dependent upon earnings expectations, capital requirements, and general financial business conditions, among other factors.  In addition, IPL and WPL currently expect to pay common stock dividends of $156 million and $126 million, respectively, to their parent company in 2017. 

Table of Contents  

Electric Transmission Service Expense -   Alliant Energy currently expects a decrease in electric transmission service expense in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to expected lower return on equity resulting from the MISO transmission owner return on equity complaints.  Alliant Energy s estimated 2017 electric transmission service expense remains subject to change pending the IUB s approval of IPL s 2017 transmission rates and the PSCW s final decision in WPL s retail electric rate case for the 2017/2018 Test Period.    Based on IPL s and WPL s electric transmission cost recovery mechanisms, IPL and WPL currently do not expect that any changes to electric transmission service costs billed by ITC and ATC will have a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations.    IPL and WPL could have a material impact on their cash flows depending on the final timing of refunds resulting from the MISO return on equity complaints, and the subsequent timing of the refunds being credited to their customers. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Overview -     Third     Quarter Results   - 
  Alliant Energy -       Executive Summary     provides an overview of Alliant Energy s   third   quarter   2016   and   2015   earnings and the various components of its business. 
    
  IPL -   Earnings available for common stock decreased $2 million primarily due to timing of income tax expense, partially offset by higher retail electric sales due to changes in temperatures in IPL s service territory and higher AFUDC in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015   related to Marshalltown. 
    
  WPL -   Earnings available for common stock increased $1 million primarily due to lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations during the   third   quarter of   2016   and higher retail electric sales due to changes in temperatures in WPL s service territory, partially offset by lower equity income from WPL s ATC investment. 
    
  Additional details of Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s   third   quarter   2016   and   2015   earnings are discussed below. 
    
  Utility Electric Margins   -   Electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric production fuel, purchased power and electric transmission service expenses.  Management believes that electric margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating revenues since electric production fuel, purchased power and electric transmission service expenses are generally passed through to customers, and therefore, result in changes to electric operating revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses. 
    
  Third   Quarter   2016   vs.   Third   Quarter   2015   Summary -   Electric margins and MWh sales for the three months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

Table of Contents  

(a) 
    On July 31, 2015, IPL sold its electric distribution assets in Minnesota to Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative.

              (b) 
    Includes $47 million and $55 million of credits on Iowa retail electric customers  bills for the   nine months ended September 30  ,   2016   and   2015  , respectively, resulting from IPL s electric tax benefit rider.  The electric tax benefit rider results in reductions in electric revenues that are offset by reductions in income tax expense for the years ended December 31,   2016   and   2015  . 
       
  Variances -   Variances between periods in electric margins for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   were as follows (in millions):

Sales Trends   - Alliant Energy s retail sales volumes increased 2% and decreased 1% for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  The three-month increase was primarily due to the impact of temperatures on residential and commercial sales due to the warmer than normal temperatures and resulting higher air cooling demand in the third quarter of 2016.  The nine-month decrease was primarily due to decreases in IPL s industrial sales due to large customer maintenance outages in 2016 and decreased retail sales related to IPL s sale of its Minnesota electric distribution assets in July 2015, partially offset by an extra day of retail sales during the first quarter of 2016 due to the leap year, and increases in WPL s commercial and industrial sales due to customer expansions. 
    
  Alliant Energy s wholesale sales volumes increased 9% and 14% for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  These increases were primarily due to additional sales from IPL s new wholesale power supply agreement with Southern Minnesota Energy Cooperative effective August 1, 2015.  These increases were partially offset by decreased sales to WPL s partial-requirement wholesale customers that have contractual options to be served by WPL, other power supply sources or the MISO market. 
    
  Alliant Energy s bulk power and other sales volumes changes were largely due to changes in sales in the wholesale energy markets operated by MISO.  These changes are impacted by several factors, including the availability and dispatch of Alliant Energy s EGUs and electricity demand within these wholesale energy markets.  Changes in bulk power and other sales revenues were largely offset by changes in fuel-related costs, and therefore, did not have a significant impact on electric margins. 
    
  Electric Production Fuel and Purchased Power (Fuel-related) Expenses   - Fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal, are burned to produce electricity at EGUs.  The cost of fossil fuels used during each period is included in electric production fuel expense.  Electricity is also purchased to meet customer demand and these costs are charged to purchased power expense. 
    
  Due to IPL s cost recovery mechanisms for fuel-related expenses, changes in fuel-related expenses resulted in comparable changes in electric revenues and, therefore, did not have a significant impact on Alliant Energy s and IPL s electric margins.  WPL s cost recovery mechanism for wholesale fuel-related expenses also provides for adjustments to its wholesale electric rates for changes in commodity costs, thereby mitigating impacts of changes to commodity costs on Alliant Energy s and WPL s electric margins. 
    
  WPL s cost recovery mechanism for retail fuel-related expenses supports deferrals of amounts that fall outside an approved bandwidth of plus or minus 2% of forecasted fuel-related expenses determined by the PSCW each year.  The difference between revenue collected and actual fuel-related expenses incurred within the bandwidth increases or decreases Alliant Energy s and WPL s electric margins.  WPL estimates the increases to electric margins from amounts within the bandwidth were approximately $2 million and $5 million for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  WPL estimates the increases to electric margins from amounts within the bandwidth were approximately $2 million and $6 million for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Alliant Energy s electric production fuel expense decreased $17 million and $51 million for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  The decreases were primarily due to lower dispatch of IPL s and WPL s coal-fired EGUs during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   partially due to lower wholesale energy market prices and WPL s retirement of Nelson Dewey Units 1 and 2 in December 2015.  The decreases were also due to changes in the under-/over-collection of fuel-related expenses at IPL and lower natural gas prices.  These items were partially offset by amortizations during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of $8 million and $22 million, respectively, of under-recovered fuel-related expenses deferred by WPL in 2014, and $4 million and $9 million of deferrals recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, for over-recovered fuel-related costs in 2016 that were outside the approved bandwidth for WPL.  The amortizations are based upon a July 2015 PSCW order authorizing WPL to recover $28 million, including interest, from its retail electric customers during 2016 for deferred fuel-related expenses incurred in 2014. 
    
  Alliant Energy s purchased power expense increased $17 million and $50 million for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively, primarily due to increased volumes purchased resulting from lower dispatch of IPL s and WPL s coal-fired EGUs during the three- and nine-month periods. 
    
  Electric Transmission Service Expense   - Costs incurred each period for the transmission of electricity to meet the demands of IPL s and WPL s customers are included in electric transmission service expense.  Electric transmission service expense is recovered from IPL s Iowa retail electric customers through a transmission cost rider and from WPL s retail electric customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings, subject to an over/under escrow

treatment.  IPL and WPL arrange transmission service for the majority of their respective wholesale electric customers.  The wholesale portion of electric transmission service expense is allocated to and recovered from these wholesale customers based on a load ratio share computation.  Due to IPL s and WPL s cost recovery mechanisms for electric transmission service expense, changes in electric transmission service expense resulted in comparable changes in electric revenues and, therefore, did not have a significant impact on Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s electric margins.  Alliant Energy s electric transmission service expense increased $11 million and $29 million for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively, primarily due to higher electric transmission service rates billed by ITC, ATC and MISO. 
    
  Utility Gas Margins   -   Gas margins are defined as gas operating revenues less cost of gas sold.  Management believes that gas margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than gas operating revenues since cost of gas sold is generally passed through to customers, and therefore, results in changes to gas operating revenues that are comparable to changes in cost of gas sold. 
    
  Third   Quarter   2016   vs.   Third   Quarter   2015   Summary -   Gas margins and Dth sales for the three months ended   September 30   were as follows: 

(a) 
    Includes $3 million of credits on IPL s Iowa retail gas customers  bills for both the   third   quarters of   2016   and   2015   resulting from the gas tax benefit rider.  The gas tax benefit rider results in reductions in gas revenues that are offset by reductions in income tax expense for the years ended December 31,   2016   and   2015  .

STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 
    
  The strategic overview summary included in the   2015   Form 10-K has not changed materially, except as described below. 
    
  Gas Transmission and Distribution Systems   -   In April 2016, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration published proposed regulations to update safety requirements for gas transmission pipelines.  The proposed regulations would add new assessment and repair criteria for gas pipelines, and require a systematic approach to verify a pipeline s maximum allowable operating pressure.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently anticipate final regulations will be issued in 2017.  Given that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has not finalized these gas transmission regulations, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict with certainty the impact of these regulations on their financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  IPL s Clinton Natural Gas Pipeline -   In August 2016, IPL received an order from the IUB authorizing IPL to construct, maintain, and operate a natural gas pipeline in Scott and Clinton Counties in Iowa, referred to as the Clinton pipeline.  Construction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017.  Capital expenditures to construct the pipeline, excluding AFUDC, are currently estimated to be approximately $30 million to $35 million. 
    
  Generation Plans   -  
  Natural Gas-Fired Generation -  
  WPL s Construction of the Riverside Expansion   -   In May 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW authorizing WPL to construct a natural gas-fired combined-cycle EGU in Beloit, Wisconsin, referred to as the Riverside expansion.    In June 2016, WPL executed a design, engineering, procurement and construction contract for the Riverside expansion.    After receiving the final necessary regulatory approvals and permits in the third quarter of 2016, WPL began constructing the Riverside expansion.  WPL currently expects to place the Riverside expansion in service by early 2020.    
    
  In November 2016, various electric cooperatives notified WPL of their intent to exercise their options to acquire approximately 60 MW of the Riverside expansion while the EGU is being constructed.  As a result of the various electric cooperatives funding a portion of the capital expenditures during construction, WPL s estimated portion of capital expenditures is now expected to be approximately $640 million.  The capital expenditures include costs to construct the EGU and a pipeline to supply natural gas to the EGU and exclude transmission network upgrades and AFUDC.    Upon exercise of their options, the current wholesale power supply agreements with the various electric cooperatives will be extended by at least four years until 2026 with automatic continuation of such agreements unless terminated by either party, with a five-year notice requirement. 
    
  Pursuant to agreements WPL entered into with Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPSC) and Madison Gas and Electric Company (MGE) related to the Riverside expansion, WPL, WPSC and MGE filed a request with the PSCW seeking approval of amendments to the Columbia joint operating agreement.  In October 2016, WPL received a decision from the PSCW approving such amendments, which allow WPSC and MGE to forgo certain capital expenditures at Columbia, resulting in WPL incurring these additional capital expenditures in exchange for a proportional increase in its ownership share of Columbia.  Based upon the additional capital expenditures WPL currently expects to incur through June 1, 2020, WPL s ownership interest in Columbia is expected to increase from 46.2% to 53.4%.  WPL currently expects to file a request with FERC in the fourth quarter of 2016 for approval of these amendments to the Columbia joint operating agreement. 
    
  IPL s Construction of Marshalltown   - IPL began constructing Marshalltown in the second quarter of 2014 after receiving the final necessary regulatory approvals and permits.  IPL executed an engineering, procurement and construction contract for Marshalltown after a competitive bidding process.  In September 2016, Marshalltown s engineering, procurement and construction contractor announced that costs to construct Marshalltown will exceed its expectations and that it expects to  

Table of Contents  

seek compensation from vendors performing work on Marshalltown.  IPL does not currently anticipate it will be responsible for these increased costs.  Capital expenditures are currently estimated to be approximately $700 million to construct the EGU and a pipeline to supply natural gas to the EGU.  The estimated capital expenditures exclude transmission network upgrades and AFUDC.  IPL expects to place Marshalltown in service by the second quarter of 2017. 
    
  Wind Generation -   The strategic plan includes the planned and potential addition of wind generation of up to 1,000 MW to Alliant Energy s resources portfolio as follows.  Estimated capital expenditures for the planned and potential wind generation projects for 2016 through 2020 are included in the  Renewable projects  line in the construction and acquisition expenditures table in     Liquidity and Capital Resources   .  
    
  IPL s Expansion of Wind Generation   -   In October 2016, IPL and the Iowa Office of Consumer Advocate, among other customer groups, filed a settlement agreement with the IUB regarding the appropriate rate-making principles for up to 500 MW of additional wind generation at IPL.  In October 2016, the IUB issued an order approving the settlement agreement, with limited modifications, and establishing rate-making principles, which IPL accepted, as follows:    

U  p to 500 MW of additional wind generation that qualifies for the full level of production tax credits, regardless of the location in Iowa, with a cost cap of $1,830/kilowatt, including AFUDC and transmission costs  .  A  ny costs incurred in excess of this $1,830/kilowatt cost cap are expected to be incorporated into rates if determined to be reasonable and prudent  . 
                
    A   depreciable life of the wind generation of 40 years, unless changed as a result of a contested case before the IUB  . 
                
    An   11.0% return on common equity, with the exception of certain transmission facilities classified as intangible assets, which would earn the rate of return on common equity the IUB finds reasonable during a future rate case  . 
                
    A   return on common equity for the calculation of AFUDC during the construction period that is the greater of 10.0% or the percentage the IUB finds reasonable during IPL s next rate case  . 
                
    The   application of double leverage is deferred until IPL s next retail electric base rate case or other future proceeding  . 
                
    A  mortization over a 10-year period of IPL s prudently incurred and unreimbursed costs, effective with IPL s next retail electric base rate case, if IPL cancels the construction of the wind generation  . 
                
    W  ithdrawal of IPL s proposed renewable energy rider, which would have allowed IPL to commence recovery of the wind projects from its retail electric customers at the time the additional wind generation was placed in service  . 
       
  IPL currently expects to add wind generation near its Whispering Willow - East wind farm, and is evaluating other siting options to build and operate the 500 MW of additional wind.    IPL plans to commence the construction process in 2016, and as a result, be eligible for the full level of production tax credits from the electricity generated during the first 10 years of operation.  IPL anticipates placing the 500 MW of additional wind generation in service in 2019 and 2020.    
    
  Franklin County Wind Farm   - In addition to IPL s expansion of wind generation discussed above, refer to    Note 3    for discussion of IPL s anticipated filing with FERC in the fourth quarter of 2016 requesting approval to transfer the 99 MW Franklin County wind farm assets from AEF to IPL in 2017. 
    
  IPL s and WPL s Potential Expansion of Wind Generation   -   In addition to IPL s 500 MW expansion of wind generation and planned transfer of the 99 MW Franklin County wind farm to IPL in 2017 discussed above, IPL and WPL are exploring options to own and operate up to 400 MW of additional new wind generation in aggregate.  The estimated capital expenditures included in  Liquidity and Capital Resources  assume this 400 MW of additional new wind generation will be equally allocated between IPL and WPL.  The final amount and allocation of this potential expansion of wind generation for IPL and WPL is subject to change pending further evaluation.

  WPL s Wisconsin Retail Electric and Gas Rate Case (2017/2018 Test Period) -   In May 2016, WPL filed a retail base rate case with the PSCW based on a forward-looking test period that includes 2017 and 2018.  WPL s filing was based on a stipulated agreement reached between PSCW staff, intervener groups and WPL.  The filing requested approval for WPL to  

Table of Contents  

implement a $13 million, or approximately 1%, increase in annual rates for WPL s retail electric customers.  The net requested increase for 2017 compared to WPL s retail electric rate case for the 2015/2016 Test Period reflects a $65 million increase in base rates, partially offset by a $52 million reduction in fuel-related costs, using a preliminary estimate for 2017 fuel-related costs.  Based on updated fuel-related cost information at the time of rate case hearings in September 2016, the current estimate of the net increase in annual rates for WPL s retail electric customers is $17 million, consisting of the original $65 million increase in base rates, partially offset by a $48 million reduction in fuel-related costs.  The filing also requested approval for WPL to implement a $9 million, or approximately 13%, increase in annual base rates for WPL s retail gas customers.  Any rate changes granted from this request are expected to be effective January 1, 2017 and extend through the end of 2018.    The key drivers for the electric and gas base rate increases are recovery of the costs for environmental controls projects at Edgewater and Columbia, and investments in electric and gas distribution systems, including expansion of natural gas pipeline infrastructure.  The filing also included utilization of amounts that WPL previously over-recovered from its customers for energy efficiency cost recovery and electric transmission cost recovery, as well as amounts deferred under the return on common equity sharing mechanism for the 2013/2014 Test Period to reduce the requested base rate increases.  The fuel-related cost component of WPL s retail electric rates for 2018 will be addressed in a separate filing, which is currently expected to be filed in the second or third quarter of 2017. 
    
  WPL s May 2016 retail base rate filing included a return on common equity of 10.0% and continues a regulatory return on common equity sharing mechanism, whereby WPL must defer a portion of its earnings if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10.25% during the 2017 and 2018 Test Period.  WPL must defer 50% of its excess earnings between 10.25% and 11.00%, and 100% of any excess earnings above 11.00%.  The May 2016 filing also included the following key assumptions (Common Equity (CE); Long-term Debt (LD); Short-term Debt (SD); Weighted-average Cost of Capital (WACC)): 

(a) 
    Average rate base is calculated using a 13-month average. 
       
  The May 2016 retail base rate filing also reflected the impact of the anticipated transfer of ATC from WPL to Alliant Energy or one of its subsidiaries by December 31, 2016 as discussed in     Other Future Considerations   ,  approved changes to depreciation rates pursuant to a September 2016 PSCW order, continued escrow treatment of transmission charges and application of AFUDC rates to 100% of the retail portion of the CWIP balances for the Riverside expansion.  If WPL does not complete the anticipated transfer of ATC to Alliant Energy or one of its subsidiaries by December 31, 2016, WPL would expect to defer the revenue requirement impacts until such time the transfer occurs or until WPL s next base rate case filing.  The filing also assumed deferral of any potential changes in revenue requirement due to anticipated increases in WPL s ownership share of Columbia resulting from the Riverside expansion agreements WPL previously entered into with neighboring utilities. 
    
  WPL currently expects a decision from the PSCW regarding this base rate filing in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  WPL s Retail Fuel-related Rate Filings -   Refer to    Note 2    for discussion of WPL s retail fuel-related rate filings for the 2015 and 2016 Test Years. 
    
  WPL s Depreciation Study -   Refer to    Note 1(c)    for discussion of a September 2016 PSCW order approving updated depreciation rates for WPL effective January 1, 2017 as a result of a recently completed depreciation study.  The September 2016 PSCW order also authorized WPL to recover the remaining net book value of Edgewater Unit 4 over a 10-year period beginning the later of the retirement date of the EGU or January 1, 2019. 
    
  IPL s Tax Benefit Riders   - Pursuant to a 2015 IUB order, IPL established tax benefit riders regulatory liabilities in 2014 to record additional tax savings related to repair expenditures and cost of removal expenditures on partial dispositions that were previously capitalized to help offset the impact of future rate increases on IPL s retail electric and gas customers.  In November 2016, IPL filed a tariff with the IUB to facilitate refunds of approximately $75 million of the related tax benefits to IPL s retail electric and gas customers in 2017.  IPL currently expects a decision from the IUB in December 2016.

  Electric Transmission Service Expense -   IPL and WPL currently receive substantially all their transmission services from ITC and ATC, respectively.  Due to the formula rates used by ITC and ATC to charge their customers and possible future changes to these rates as discussed below, there is uncertainty regarding the long-term trends of IPL s and WPL s future electric transmission service expense.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently anticipate future changes to their electric transmission service expense as follows: 
    
  2017 Electric Transmission Service Expense   - Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL currently estimate their total electric transmission service expense in 2017 will be lower than the comparable expense in 2016 by approximately $20 million, $15 million and $5 million, respectively.  Such decreases are primarily due to expected lower return on equity resulting from the MISO transmission owner return on equity complaints.  Alliant Energy s, IPL s and WPL s estimated 2017 electric transmission service expense remains subject to change pending the IUB s approval of IPL s 2017 transmission rates and the PSCW s final decision in WPL s retail electric rate case for the 2017/2018 Test Period. 
    
  MISO Transmission Owner Return on Equity Complaints   -   A group of MISO cooperative and municipal utilities previously filed two complaints with FERC requesting a reduction to the base return on equity used by MISO transmission owners, including ITC and ATC.  In September 2016, FERC issued an order on the first complaint and established a base return on equity of 10.32%, excluding any incentive adders granted by FERC, for the refund period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015.  In October 2016, in response to MISO s and the MISO transmission owners  request, FERC ordered the related refunds be issued by July 2017.    
    
  In June 2016, a FERC administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the second complaint and recommended a base return on equity of 9.70%, excluding any incentive adders granted by FERC, for the refund period from February 12, 2015 through May 11, 2016.  A final decision from FERC on the second complaint is currently expected in the first half of 2017.     

Table of Contents  

Alliant Energy and WPL have realized a cumulative $24 million of reductions in the amount of equity income from ATC as a result of the two complaints through September 30, 2016, including $9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  These reductions are based upon a 10.32% base return on equity for the first complaint period and assume a 10.2% return on equity (9.70% base return on equity plus 50 basis point incentive adder approved in a previous FERC order) for the second complaint period and thereafter. 
    
  Attachment  O  Rates   - The annual transmission service rates that ITC or ATC charges their customers are calculated each calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate referred to as Attachment  O.   Because Attachment  O  is a FERC-approved formula rate, ITC and ATC can implement new rates each calendar year without filing a request with FERC.  However, new rates are subject to challenge by either FERC or customers.  If the rates proposed by ITC or ATC are determined by FERC to be unjust or unreasonable or another mechanism is determined by FERC to be just and reasonable, ITC s or ATC s rates would change accordingly. 
    
  2017 Rates Charged by ATC to WPL   - In October 2016, ATC shared with its customers the Attachment  O  rate it proposes to charge them in 2017 for electric transmission services.  The proposed rate was based on ATC s estimated net revenue requirement for 2017 as well as a true-up adjustment credit related to amounts that ATC over-recovered from its customers in 2015 and expects to over-recover from its customers in 2016.  Amounts billed under the 2017 Attachment  O  rate are currently expected to be approximately 5% lower than the amounts ATC is charging its customers in 2016.  The proposed rate for 2017 reflects a 10.82% return on equity for the impact of FERC s September 2016 order to lower the base return on equity for MISO transmission owners to 10.32% discussed above, plus a 50 basis point incentive return on equity adder based on ATC s participation in MISO. 
    
  2017 Rates Charged by ITC to IPL   - In October 2016, ITC filed with MISO the Attachment  O  rate it proposes to charge its customers in 2017 for electric transmission services.  The proposed rate was based on ITC s estimated net revenue requirement for 2017 as well as a true-up adjustment related to amounts that ITC under-recovered from its customers in 2015.  Amounts billed under the 2017 Attachment  O  rate are currently expected to be approximately 4% higher than the amounts ITC is charging its customers in 2016.  The proposed rate for 2017 reflects an 11.32% return on equity for the impact of FERC s September 2016 order to lower the base return on equity for MISO transmission owners to 10.32% discussed above, plus a 50 basis point incentive return on equity adder based on ITC s participation in MISO, as well as a 50 basis point incentive return on equity adder for ITC being an independent transmission company.  The proposed rate for 2017 also reflects the impacts of bonus tax depreciation deductions for 2015, 2016 and 2017 in response to FERC s March 2016 order discussed below. 
    
  ITC Bonus Tax Depreciation Deductions   - In December 2015, IPL filed a complaint with FERC regarding ITC s Attachment  O  rate pursuant to FERC-approved Attachment  O  protocols.  IPL s complaint alleged that ITC acted imprudently by failing to take advantage of tax savings benefits available through bonus tax depreciation deductions, which results in higher Attachment  O  rates being billed by ITC to IPL.  In March 2016, FERC issued an order concluding that ITC acted imprudently by failing to take advantage of tax savings benefits available through bonus tax depreciation deductions.  The FERC order requires ITC to recalculate its Attachment  O  rate effective January 1, 2015 to simulate taking bonus tax depreciation deductions for 2015.  In April 2016, ITC filed a request for rehearing of FERC s March 2016 order.  IPL subsequently filed a response to ITC s request for rehearing, requesting that FERC require ITC to also take bonus tax depreciation deductions for 2012 through 2014.  In June 2016, FERC issued an order rejecting ITC s and IPL s requests.  If ITC does not take advantage of bonus tax depreciation deductions in 2016 or in future years, IPL retains the right under Attachment  O  protocols to challenge ITC s decision if IPL deems that decision to be imprudent.  Alliant Energy and IPL are currently reviewing ITC s estimated impacts through the FERC-approved Attachment  O  protocols.   
    
  Electric Transmission Cost Recovery   - Any changes in IPL s electric transmission service costs billed by ITC to IPL are expected to be passed on to IPL s Iowa retail electric customers through the transmission cost recovery rider.  The difference between WPL s actual electric transmission service expense incurred and amounts collected from customers as electric revenues in 2017 is expected to be recorded as electric transmission service expense with an offsetting amount recorded to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability due to the escrow treatment proposed by WPL in its 2017/2018 Test Period retail electric rate case.    Based on IPL s and WPL s electric transmission cost recovery mechanisms, IPL and WPL currently do not expect that any changes to electric transmission service costs billed by ITC and ATC will have a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations.    IPL and WPL could have a material impact on their cash flows depending on the final timing of refunds resulting from the MISO return on equity complaints, and the subsequent timing of the refunds being credited to their customers.

WPL s Future Transfer of Investment in ATC -   In June 2016, WPL received an order from the PSCW requiring WPL to transfer its investment in ATC to Alliant Energy or an Alliant Energy subsidiary by December 31, 2022.  In addition, WPL is required to obtain PSCW approval prior to transferring any additional capital or assets to ATC.    WPL is currently evaluating the impacts of the June 2016 PSCW order on its results of operations and financial condition.    Subsequent to WPL transferring its investment in ATC, future contributions to, and equity earnings and dividends from, the investment in ATC would occur at the entity to which the investment in ATC was transferred and would not be reflected in WPL s consolidated financial statements.  As a result, WPL s earnings and cash flows from operations are expected to decrease subsequent to the transfer.  This transfer is not expected to impact Alliant Energy s consolidated financial statements.
