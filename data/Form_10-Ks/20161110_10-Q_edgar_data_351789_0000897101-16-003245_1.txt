Note
1.   Basis of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.  

This
report should be read together with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, including
the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes therein.  

Management
believes that the unaudited financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary to
fairly state the financial position and results of operations as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine-month periods
then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The results of interim
periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the year.  

Nature
of Business   

Electro-Sensors,
Inc. manufactures and markets a complete line of monitoring and control systems for a variety of industrial machinery. The Company
uses leading-edge technology to continuously improve its products and make them easier to use, with the ultimate goal of manufacturing
the industry-preferred product for every market served. The Company sells these products through an internal sales staff, manufacturers 
representatives, and distributors to a wide variety of industries that use the products in a variety of applications to monitor
process machinery operations. The Company markets its products to customers located throughout the United States, Canada, Latin
America, Europe, and Asia.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
carrying value of cash equivalents, treasury bills, trade receivables, accounts payable, and other financial working capital items
approximates fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, due to the short maturity nature of these instruments.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company records compensation expense for stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option pricing model. The Company uses historical data, among other factors, to estimate
the expected price volatility, the expected option life, and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free interest rate is based
on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates, including the underlying assumptions,
consist of economic lives of long-lived assets, realizability of trade receivables, valuation of deferred tax assets/liabilities,
inventory, investments, contingent earn-out, and stock compensation expense. It is at least reasonably possible that these estimates
may change in the near term.

Note
2.   Investments  

The
cost and estimated fair value of the Company s investments are as follows:   

During
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, the Company sold 122,649 shares of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (ticker symbol RTEC)
stock and reported gains of $1,447 in non-operating income. As of September 30, 2016, the Company held no shares of RTEC stock.

Note
3. Fair Value Measurements   

The
following table provides information on those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  

December
31, 2015   

The
fair value of the money market funds, commercial paper and treasury bills is based on quoted market prices in an active market.
The available-for-sale equity security is a limited-marketable company. There is an insignificant market for the limited-marketable
company and the Company has determined its value based on financial and other factors, which are considered level 3 inputs in
the fair value hierarchy. Management estimated the probability of meeting the revenue targets over the measurement period to determine
the fair value of the contingent earn-out, which is considered a level 3 input in the fair value hierarchy.  

The
change in level 3 liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis is summarized as follows:  

The
decrease in the contingent liability reflects the Company s expectation of moderately lower future contingent payments throughout
the four year earn-out period.

Note
5.   Stock-Based Compensation   

During
the first quarter of 2016, the Company granted its Chief Executive Officer options to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock.
The options were priced at fair market value and vested 20% on the grant date, with an additional 20% vesting on the first four
anniversaries of the grant date. The options expire ten years from the date of grant.  

The
assumptions made in estimating the fair value of the options on the grant date based upon the BSM option-pricing model for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

As
of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $105 of unrecognized compensation expense. The Company expects to recognize this
expense over the next four years.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including
statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. Forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, statements relating to our marketing efforts or our efforts to accelerate growth; our business development
activities; our efforts to maintain or reduce production costs; management s intention that we not become an investment company;
our expected use of cash on hand; our cash requirements; and the sufficiency of our cash flows. Any statement that is not based
solely upon historical facts, including strategies for the future and the outcome of events that have not yet occurred, is considered
a forward-looking statement. 

All forward-looking statements in this document
are based on information available to us as of the date of this Form 10Q, and we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking
statements, other than as required by law. Our actual results could differ materially from those in projected or indicated in these
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause future
results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements, including the accuracy
of management s assumptions with respect to industry trends, fluctuations in industry conditions, the accuracy of management s
assumptions regarding expenses and our cash needs and those listed under the heading  Cautionary Statements  under
 Item 1 Business,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make decisions based upon estimates,
assumptions, and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances. These decisions include the selection of applicable accounting
principles and the use of judgment in their application, and affect reported amounts and disclosures. Changes in economic conditions
or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of management s estimates and assumptions. An in-depth description
of our accounting estimates can be found in the interim financial statements included in this report and in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We have not developed new estimates subsequent to those discussed in our Annual
Report. 

The following table contains selected financial information,
for the periods indicated, from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 

11  

The following discusses the Company s performance for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (in thousands)  

Net Sales    

Net sales for the three-month period ended ending September
30, 2016 were $1,837, a decrease of $295 or 13.8% over the same period in 2015. Net sales for the 2016 nine-month period were $5,562,
a decrease of $503 or 8.3% over the same period in 2015. The 2016 three-month decrease was primarily due to weaker performance
in the east and southeastern regions of the U.S. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to negatively affect many
of our international markets. Sales to Canada were particularly affected and were down 27% compared to the same three-month period
in 2015. 

Furthermore, during the quarter the Company
experienced a lower average value per order, resulting in a decline in overall large
order performance. We believe this was caused by a trend in our general manufacturing customers shifting their production from
a build-to-stock to build-to-order strategy. 

Gross Profit    

Gross profit for the 2016 three-month period
decreased $210, or 17.3%, from $1,212 to $1,002, over the same period in 2015. Gross profit for the 2016 nine-month period decreased
$290 or 8.5%, from $3,400 to $3,110, over the 2015 period. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 54.5% in the
2016 three-month period from 56.8% in the prior year, and decreased to 55.9% in the 2016 nine-month period compared to 56.1% in
the prior year. The decrease in the gross margin was primarily due to product mix and under-utilization of capacity in production
due to lower sales. 

Operating Expenses    

Total operating expenses increased $55, or
6.0%, for the 2016 three-month period compared to the same period in 2015 and increased as a percentage of sales to 53.0% from
43.1%. Total operating expenses increased $76, or 2.6%, for the 2016 nine-month period compared to the same period in 2015 and
increased as a percentage of sales to 54.3% from 48.6%. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due primarily
to the fact that 2016 third quarter sales decreased 13.8% from 2015 sales and the 2016 nine-month sales decreased 8.3% from 2015
sales. 

Selling and marketing expenses increased $19, or 5.2%, in the 2016 three-month period over the prior
year, and increased as a percentage of net sales to 21.1% from 17.3%. Selling and marketing expenses increased $76, or 6.4%, in
the 2016 nine-month period over the prior year period, and increased as a percentage of net sales to 22.7% from 19.6%. The 2016
three-month period increase resulted from an increase in wages and benefits due to additional marketing personnel. The nine-month
period increase resulted from higher wages and benefits due to hiring additional personnel, the cost of providing system demonstrations
to potential customers, cost associated with attending a higher number of tradeshows, and increased travel.   

General and administrative expenses decreased $3, or 0.8%, for the 2016 three-month period
                                                                                                                                     compared to the same period in 2015, but increased as a percentage of net sales to 21.0% from 18.2%. For the 2016 nine-month
                                                                                                                                     period, general and administrative expenses increased $5, or 0.4%, compared to the 2015 period and increased as a percentage
                                                                                                                                     of net sales to 21.5% from 19.7%. The decrease for the 2016 three-month period was primarily due to a decrease in
                                                                                                                                     amortization of our enterprise software and related hardware, which was fully amortized in 2015, partially offset by an
                                                                                                                                     increase in stock compensation expense for an option granted to the Chief Executive Officer in February 2016. The increase
                                                                                                                                     for the nine-month period resulted from an increase in wages and benefits, legal and professional fees, and director fees.
                                                                                                                                     This increase was partially offset by decreases in contract personnel, due to the 2015 expensing of post-closing deliverables
                                                                                                                                     related to the HazardPRO acquisition, and amortization of our enterprise software and related hardware, which was fully
                                                                                                                                     amortized in 2015.   

Research and development expenses increased $39, or 24.2%, in the 2016 three month period from
the same period in 2015 and increased as a percentage of net sales to 10.9% from 7.6%. For the 2016 nine month period, research
and development expenses decreased $5, or 0.9%, over the 2015 period, but increased as a percentage of net sales to 10.1% from
9.3%. The increase for the 2016 three-month period resulted from lab testing costs for additional certifications for the HazardPRO
product line and contract engineering fees related to HazardPRO software modifications and upgrades. The decrease for nine-month
period is due to a decrease in lab testing and certifications on our HazardPRO product line and salaries due to reduced staffing,
which was partially offset by an increase in third quarter costs in contract engineering related to HazardPRO software modifications
and upgrades.

Three-month operating income decreased 90.1%
to $29 from $294 and nine-month operating income decreased 80.6% to $88 from $454, due primarily to lower 2016 revenue. 

Non-Operating Income    

Non-operating income
increased by $1, or 20.0%, for the 2016 three-month period compared to the same 2015 period. Non-operating income decreased $1,428,
or 98.0%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease was due to the liquidation
of 122,649 shares of Rudolph Technologies, Inc. stock during the first half of 2015, which resulted in a recognized gain of $1,447. 

Income Before Income Taxes    

Income before income taxes was $35 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a decrease of $264, or 88.3%, when compared to the same period in 2015. Income
before income taxes was $117 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, representing a decrease of $1,794, or 93.9%, when compared
to the same period in 2015. 

The decrease for both 2016 periods was the
result of a decrease in revenue. In addition, the decrease for 2016 nine-month period was also the result of a decrease in the
sale of available-for-sale securities recognized in 2016. During the 2015 nine-month period, we recognized $1,449 of gain on sale
of available-for-sale securities (see  Non-Operating Income (Expense) ). 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Cash and cash equivalents were $792 at September 30, 2016, and
$569 at December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly from investing activities. 

Cash used in operations was favorably affected by a decrease
in inventories, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. For the 2016 nine-month period we used $380 less cash
in operations than in the 2015 nine-month period. In the 2016 period, the Company had a decrease in inventories due to delaying
purchases as a result of lower revenues. 

Cash generated from investing activities was $462 and $1,855
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the 2016 and 2015 nine-month periods, the Company had
net proceeds of Treasury Bills with a maturity date of more than three months of $464 and $407, respectively. In addition, the
Company generated $1,467 in proceeds on the sale of available-for-sale securities during 2015 from the sale of Rudolph stock. 

Cash used in financing activities was $390 and $381 for respective
2016 and 2015 nine-month periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid $390 and $381, respectively,
on the long-term debt owed to Harvest Engineering, Inc. ( Harvest ) for the technology purchased in February 2014.
As of September 30, 2016, the note payable to Harvest has been paid in full. 

Our ongoing cash requirements will be primarily for capital
expenditures, research and development, and working capital. Management believes that cash on hand and any cash provided by operations
will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
no off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions. 

Future Business Development Activities

The Company continues to seek growth opportunities, both internally
through the Company s existing portfolio of products, technologies and markets, as well as externally through technology
partnerships or related-product acquisitions. Although the Company is continuing to explore these external opportunities, it currently
has no agreements or understandings with any third parties.
