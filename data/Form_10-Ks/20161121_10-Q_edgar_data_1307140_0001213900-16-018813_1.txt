1.  
      DESCRIPTION
    OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficiency and
cash flows for the periods presented have been prepared by Lifestyle Medical Network, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the  Company 
or  Lifestyle ) and are unaudited. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the requirements
for unaudited interim periods, and consequently, do not include all disclosures required to be made in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely
of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, changes in stockholders'
deficiency and cash flows for all periods presented have been made. The information for the consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2015 was derived from audited financial statements of the Company.  

Organization    

Lifestyle
Medical Network Inc. and Subsidiaries (the  Company  or  Lifestyle ) was incorporated in the State of
Nevada.  The Company directs its operations through its subsidiaries.  The Company, through its consulting
subsidiaries, plans to continue to identify and enter into management and professional consulting services agreements, and to
license medical and health technologies, to medical and health clinic operating companies. The Company also intends to open, operate
and acquire medical and health clinics, if financing is available and the profile of the clinics  is favorable.  

Material
Agreements    

The
Company entered management agreements, and have commenced recognizing revenues thereunder, with two medical professional associations
located in Houston, Texas, MED-Cure Primary Care Physicians, P.A. and MED-CURE Anti-Aging and Skin Care, P.A. (the  MED-CURE
Companies ), effective April 1, 2015, which were purchased by Dr. Ronald Moomaw, a director of the Company. The MED-CURE
Companies between them operate six medical clinics in Houston, of which four are primary care clinics and two are skin care clinics.
Under management agreements with the MED-CURE Companies, the Company, through its subsidiary LifeStyle Texas Medical Management,
LLC ( LifeStyle Management ), provides organizational development, accounting, human resources, computer technical
support compliance, scheduling, marketing and advertising, office space, equipment supplies and other management services and
receives an agreed percentage of the gross revenues of the practice group, with adjustments designed to ensure that management
fees do not exceed an agreed cap, or that the monthly payments do not result in an event of default under the acquisition financing
documents for the MED-CURE Companies. The leasing arrangements for the properties leased for the MED-CURE Companies  clinics 
offices were restructured, with our real estate subsidiary, LifeStyle Texas Real Estate. LLC leasing the properties and then subleasing
the properties back to the MED-CURE Companies.  

Through
our subsidiary, Regional Professional Alliance, Inc. , a physician s professional consulting company that provides professional
medical consulting services to medical management companies related to matters affecting professional licensure and medical clinic
compliance matters for the benefit of clinics managed by Lifestyle Management, we have entered into an agreement with Dr. Moomaw
to provide services through Regional Professional Alliance for the benefit of LifeStyle Management related to oversight and professional
medical services coordination of the managed clinics which have entered into management services agreements with LifeStyle Management.
Through LifeStyle Texas Licensing, LLC ( LifeStyle Licensing ), the Company plans to sublicense to the MED-CURE Companies
the non-exclusive right to use, and to sublicense the use of, certain patents, trademarks, trade names, logos, slogans, trade
dress, commercial symbols, operational systems, and other intellectual property rights, in connection with operating and managing
medical clinics that provide medical services and/or products of a character and quality, in particular relating to men s
health and weight management.  

Going
Concern    

The
consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates
the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has
a past history of recurring losses from operations and is a development stage company. The Company will require additional funding
to execute its future strategic business plan. Successful business operations and its transition to attaining profitability are
dependent upon obtaining additional financing and achieving a level of revenue to support its cost structure. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  

The
Company has entered into Management agreements with six medical clinics in Houston, Texas. The Company will provide services to
the clinic and will receive an agreed percentage of gross revenues of the practice group. Management intends to make further acquisitions
of other medical clinics during 2016.  

Management
believes these acquisitions will be profitable and the cash flows from these operations will enable the Company to fund the operations
of the consolidated group over the next twelve months. Therefore, the annual financial statements continue to be prepared on a
going concern basis.  

Significant
Accounting Policies   

The
Company s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and the Company does not expect that the adoption of other recent accounting pronouncements will have a material
impact on its financial statements.  

2.    INTANGIBLES    

The
MPL License Agreement    

The
MPL License Agreement, under which the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite, is the licensee pursuant to the Assignment from
WMA, provides for the license of medical services, operational systems, manuals, certain names and logo designs and other intellectual

of the continental United States (the  Licensed Rights ). The License Agreement provides for a fee of 6% of gross
receipts of Licensee, payable quarterly. The term of the License Agreement is for twenty (20) years from the effective date, May
9, 2011. The Company plans to establish new medical clinics or acquire existing clinics, as well as to provide consulting services
to medical clinics utilizing the Licensed Rights.

or debt extinguishment criteria. The Company revalued the warrants issued and agreed the additional consideration, extended maturity
dates and interest to the extended agreement. The Company deems that based on the analysis performed, debt extinguishment does
exist and recorded loss on debt extinguishment in the amount of $61,697.

                                         to convert the outstanding principal amount of this note, or any portion hereof, and
                                         any accrued interest into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price

6.    ACCOUNTS
                                         PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES    

7.  
      BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE   

Basic
earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period. At September 30, 2016, there were 11,622,521 potential common shares. Because
of the net loss, the effect of these potential common shares is anti-dilutive.

at exercise prices of $0.07 and $0.08 per share. The warrants were issued in connection with services to be provided to the Company

June 13, 2016, the Company issued a warrant to Roy Meadows to purchase 250,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an
exercise price of $0.025 per share. The warrant was issued in connection with a financing provided to the Company. The fair value
of the warrant was $17,500, of which $5,104 was expensed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
estimated value of the warrants was determined using the Black Scholes pricing model using the following assumptions: expected

424%. The fair value of the warrants amounted to $708,910.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report.  Certain statements contained
in this report, including, without limitation, statements containing the words  believes,   anticipates, 
 expects  and words of similar import, constitute  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and
uncertainties.  Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
as a result of certain factors, including our ability to create, sustain, manage or forecast our growth; our ability to attract
and retain key personnel; changes in our business strategy or development plans; competition; business disruptions; adverse publicity;
and international, national and local general economic and market conditions.  

Organization   

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 3, 2003, under the name Beverly Hills Film Studios, Inc. and changed
its name to Emerging Media Holdings, Inc. on September 28, 2006. On September 30, 2006, we acquired IM  Media Alianta 
SRL, the 100% owner of SA  Analiticmedia-Grup , both Moldovan companies ( AMG ), and on May 2, 2008  TNT-Bravo 
channel-ICS  Media Top Prim  SRL, the exclusive operator in Moldova of Russian channel TNT programs owned by Gazprom
Media.  

We
changed the focus of our business and disposed of three of our Moldova media subsidiaries on February 10, 2011. On December 29,
2011, we completed the sale of our remaining Moldova media subsidiaries and acquired rights to technologies and practices pursuant
to an October 5, 2010 License Agreement for operating technologies and processes services related to men s health within
the territory of the continental United States. On February 2, 2012, we acquired the full assignment of rights to this License
Agreement. Effective July 31, 2012, the name of our Company was changed from Emerging Media Holdings, Inc. to Lifestyle Medical
Network Inc.    

Recent
Developments   

Dr.
Ronald Moomaw, a director of the Company and a licensed physician in the State of Texas, who had been assisting the Company in
evaluating the acquisition by the Company of two medical practices in Houston, Texas, purchased the two medical professional associations
(the  MED-CURE Companies ), effective April 1, 2015, for a purchase price of $2,500,000, utilizing local bank financing.
The MED-CURE Companies between them operate six medical clinics in Houston, of which four are primary care clinics and two are
skin care clinics. The MED-CURE Companies agreed, effective April 1, 2015, to enter into management agreements with the Company,
pursuant to which the Company, through its subsidiary Lifestyle Texas Medical Management, LLC ( Lifestyle Management ),
has provided organizational development, accounting, human resources, computer technical support compliance, scheduling, marketing
and advertising, office space, equipment supplies and other management services and receives an agreed percentage of the gross
revenues of the practice group, with adjustments designed to ensure that management fees do not exceed an agreed cap, or that
monthly payments do not result in an event of default under the acquisition financing documents for the MED-CURE Companies. The
leasing arrangements for the properties leased for the MED-CURE Companies  clinics  offices were restructured, with
our real estate subsidiary, Lifestyle Texas Real Estate, LLC, leasing the properties and then subleasing the properties back to
the Med-Cure Companies.  

Dr.
Moomaw on April 21, 2016, acquired an additional clinic in Houston, Texas, which clinic is now operated under the name RCM Total
Care Medical PA, PLLC. The Total Care Clinic is managed by Lifestyle Management, pursuant to management agreements between the
Lifestyle Management and the clinics for the provision of administrative and business services by the Management Company for the
physician practices of the clinics. The clinics will enter into license agreements with Lifestyle Licensing, for the license of
specified protocols and procedures for application in their respective medical practices.  

Through
our subsidiary, Regional Professional Alliance, Inc., a physician s professional consulting company that provides professional
medical consulting services to medical management companies related to matters affecting professional licensure and medical clinic
compliance matters for the benefit of clinics managed by Lifestyle Management, we have entered into an agreement with Dr. Moomaw
to provide services through Regional Professional Alliance for the benefit of Lifestyle Management related to oversight and professional
medical services coordination of the managed clinics which have entered into management services agreements with Lifestyle Management.
Through Lifestyle Texas Licensing, LLC ( Lifestyle Licensing ), the Company plans to sublicense to the MED-CURE Companies
and RCM Total Care the non-exclusive right to use, and to sublicense the use of, certain patents, trademarks, trade names, service
marks, logos, slogans, trade dress, commercial symbols, operational systems, and other intellectual property rights, in connection
with operating and managing medical clinics that provide medical services and/or products of a distinctive character and quality,
in particular relating to men s health and weight management.  

Throughout
this Form 10-Q, the terms  we,   us,   our,   LMN  and the  Company  refer to
Lifestyle Medical Network Inc., a Nevada corporation, and unless the context indicates otherwise, includes our subsidiaries.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The
discussion and analysis of our plan of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of our consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount
of reported assets and liabilities.  

Some
accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially
different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results
may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  

The
Company s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015.  There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, and the Company does not expect that the adoption of other recent accounting pronouncements will have
a material impact on its financial statements.  

PLAN
OF OPERATION  

Through
our consulting subsidiaries, we plan to contract to provide management, marketing and professional consulting services, and to
license medical and health technologies, to medical and health clinic operating companies. We are evaluating opening and operating
a MSO in the near future, assuming the business outlook would be favorable. We also intend to open, operate and acquire men s
medical and health clinics, if financing is available and the profile of the clinics  services is consistent with the types
of medical businesses we view as favorable for acquisition.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 
 
THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of $675,339, as compared with revenues of $319,500 in the three months
ended September 30, 2015, and we recorded a net profit of $140,882 in 2016, as compared with a net loss of $108,385 for 2015.
The net profit in 2016 was principally due to an increase in revenues during 2016 offset by an increase in interest expense in
2016. In 2016, cost of revenue related to management fees was $202,613 and of cost of revenue related to rental income was $67,894,
for which the 2015 amounts were $108,251and $67,894, respectively, and amortization of warrant expense in 2016 was $32,616, compared
to $58,000 in 2015. Interest expense incurred in 2016 was $161,072 and general and administrative expense was $135,509, as compared
with interest expense of $32,082 and $161,588 in general and administrative expense in 2015. The increase in cost of revenue in
2016 was due to commencement of medical consulting operations in Houston in April 2015.  

NINE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had revenues of $1,456,839, as compared with revenues of $586,483 in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, and we incurred a net loss of $166,767 in 2016, as compared with a net loss of $750,413 for
2015. The higher net loss in 2015 was principally due to an increase in revenues during 2016 offset by an increase in
interest expenses in 2016. Total costs remain constant as increase in operating costs in 2016 were offset by a decrease in
the amortization of warrants in 2016. In 2016, cost of revenue related to management fees was $507,220 and of cost of revenue
related to rental income was $203,682, for which the 2015 amounts were $138,035 and $135,914, respectively, and amortization
of warrant expense in 2016 was $47,389 compared to $625,335 in 2015. Interest expense incurred in 2016 was $363,545 and
general and administrative expense was $465,023, as compared with interest expense of $64,532 and $ 372,810 in general and
administrative expense in 2015. The increase in cost of revenue and general and administrative expense in 2016 was due to
commencement of medical consulting operations in Houston in April 2015.  

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES 

At October 31, 2016, we had total assets of
$2,393,260 compared to total assets of $937,328 at December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months
ended October 31, 2016 was $378,710, as compared with net cash used in operating activities of $345,891 in 2015; net cash used
in investing activities was $577,560 in 2016 and $100,448 in 2015; and net cash generated from financing activities was $300,000
in 2016 and $500,000 in 2015.   

At October 31, 2016, we had working capital
of $68,368. At October 31, 2016, we had total assets of $2,393,260, including cash of $150,869. In 2016 we had revenues of
$1,456,839, and incurred a net loss of $166,717. There is no assurance that we will operate profitably in the future. 

The
Company has financed its operations in 2016 in part with issuances of convertible debt to private investors.  

On
February 18, 2016, the Company executed an unsecured promissory note with Gail Keats and received $30,000. The promissory note
bears interest at 10% per annum and both principal and interest are payable on or before August 15, 2016. The Company repaid the
note in full in July 2016.  

On
April 1, 2016, the Company issued a secured promissory note to Emile Fares, M,D, (the  Payee ) and promised to the
Payee $275,000 in exchange for all the medical equipment owned by RMC Totalcare Medical PA.. The secured promissory note bears
interest at 6% per annum and matures one year from the date issuance. A payment of $75,000 is due October 1, 2016 and the balance
due on the maturity date. The note is secured by all collections received by Lifestyle Texas Medical Management LLC pursuant to
a Management Agreement with RMC Totalcare Medical PA.  

On
May 16, 2016, the Company amended its loan agreements with Roy Meadows ( Meadows ). The Company agreed to pay Meadows
a renewal fee of $28,000 and $27,956 on its two outstanding loans with Meadows and extend the maturity dates of the loans to April
28, 2017 and June 8, 2017, respectively. The new outstanding balances of the loans including interest and the renewal fees amounted
to $308,000 and $307,520, respectively.  

The
Company also agreed to amend the conversion price of the loans into the Company s common stock to $0.10 per share. At any
time, the holder of the notes, at his option, shall have the right to convert the outstanding principal balance or any portion
of the principal amount hereof, and any accrued interest into shares of common stock of the Company. The fair value of the common
stock at the date of issuance of the advance was $0.13, which created a beneficial conversion feature of $409,766. The beneficial
conversion feature was recorded as a debt discount over the life of the notes. The debt discount as of September 30, 2016 was
$257,056.  

On
June 13, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory note to Meadows and received proceeds of $250,000. The promissory note
bears interest at 12% per annum and matures one year from the date of issuance. At any time, the holder of the note, at his sole
option, shall have the right to convert the outstanding principal amount of this note, or any portion of the principal hereof,
and any accrued interest into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price of $0.15 per share.   

On
August 24, 2016, the Company borrowed $50,000 from Daniel Hagen. The loan is at an interest rate of 8%, is due August 24, 2018,
and is convertible into common stock at an exercise price of $.06 per share. The fair value of the Company s common stock
on the date of funding of the loan resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of $8,333, which was recorded as a debt discount
over the life of the loan. The debt discount as of September 30,2016 was $7,488.  

There
is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital to implement our business plans. The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  These conditions and uncertainties
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements falling within the definition of Item 303(c) of Regulation S-B.  

Inflation   

To
date inflation has not had a material impact on our operations.

ITEM
4.  Controls and Procedures.   

As
of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer
of the Company (the  Certifying Officer ) conducted an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures.  As
defined under Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ),
the term  disclosure controls and procedures  means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the issuer s management, including the Certifying Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Based
on this evaluation, the Certifying Officer has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported by management of the Company on a timely basis to comply with the Company s disclosure obligations under the Exchange
Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated there under.  

Further,
there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third fiscal quarter of our
2016 fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting.

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   

The
following table sets forth the sales of unregistered securities since the Company s last report filed under this item.  

(1)    The
                                         Company believes that the issuance of the warrants and the convertible loan above are
                                         transactions exempt from registration as provided by Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506 of
                                         Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ).
                                         The sale of the convertible loan did not involve a public offering and was made without
                                         general solicitation or general advertising to a holder who qualifies as an  accredited
                                         investor  under Rule 501 under the Securities Act. Each of the holders acquired
                                         the securities for investment purposes only and not with a view to or for sale in connection
                                         with any distribution thereof. Neither the warrants or convertible loan, nor the underlying
                                         shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise or conversion thereof have been registered
                                         under the Securities Act and none may be offered or sold in the United States absent
                                         registration under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration requirements.

4.
