NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of the Business 

Virtual Piggy, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on February 11, 2008.   

The Company is a technology company that seeks to deliver an online ecommerce solution for the family. The Company s system allows parents and their children to manage, allocate funds and track their expenditures, savings and charitable giving online. The system is designed to allow a minor to transact online without a credit card by gaining the parents  permission ahead of time and allowing the parent to set up the rules of use. The Company s Oink product offering was discontinued in March 2016. 

The Company believes that a future alternative for Virtual Piggy s technology will revolve around the FinTech industry with a partner-first go to market model in which established payments market leaders and vertical market participants can incorporate and integrate the Company s platform into co-branded payments solutions targeting youth and family.  The Company also believes this approach will enable the Company to reduce expenses while broadening its reach.

Within this affinity partner model, the Company will seek to incorporate licensing fees and customization services.  This would enable the company to begin creating shareholder value above and beyond consumer transaction fees.

The Company is also analyzing specific components of our technology for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the Business to Business ( B2B ) realm.

In addition, the Company is currently adding enhancements to the platform, to enable the platform to update itself with any new regulations that are passed, in order to reduce costs associated with manually updating the platform.  This will also enable the Company to market the platform to other companies in need of a solution to comply with the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act ( COPPA ) or other regulatory requirements.

The Company s primary strategic objective over the next 12 -18 months is to increase the value of the underlying technical assets of the Company by incorporating new essential functionality that will act as a key differentiator in the financial services market.  In addition, the Company is redirecting its marketing efforts to increase its user base by entering into affinity marketing agreements with companies targeting specific user communities.  This approach should greatly reduce the expense associated with direct marketing efforts.

The Company s principal office is located in Palm Beach, Florida.

On December 3, 2015, Finity, Inc. was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  On December 11, 2015, Finity, Inc. changed its name to Finitii, Inc.  Finitii, Inc. was established as a not for profit entity for the purpose of teaching children financial literacy.  Finitii, Inc. has had no operations since it was formed.

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The accompanying unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

Table of Contents 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Virtual Piggy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Finitii, Inc. (collectively the  Company ), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional financing to operationalize the Company s current technology before another company develops similar technology to compete with the Company.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

As of September 30, 2016 and for the period then ended, there were no recently adopted accounting pronouncements that had a material effect on the Company s financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

As of September 30, 2016, there are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted which would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements through 2017.

NOTE 2   MANAGEMENT PLANS

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  The Company has incurred significant losses and experienced negative cash flow from operations since inception.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Since inception, the Company has focused on developing and implementing its business plan.  The Company believes that its existing cash resources will not be sufficient to sustain operations during the next twelve months.    The Company currently needs to generate revenue in order to sustain its operations.  In the event that the Company cannot generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations, the Company will need to reduce expenses or obtain financing through the sale of debt and/or equity securities.  The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders.  If the Company is unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company would likely be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material, adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company s current monetization model is to license its platform to merchants, financial institutions and others to enable them to provide COPPA compliant services for themselves and their customers.

As of November 14, 2016, the Company has a cash position of approximately $340,000.  Based upon the current cash position and the Company s planned expense run rate, management believes the Company has funds currently to finance its operations through November 2016.

NOTE 3   ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES   RELATED PARTIES

The Company owes the Chief Executive Officer a total of $39,603 as of September 30, 2016, including unpaid salary of $31,769 and expenses of $7,834.

The Company also owes the Chief Financial Officer a total of $37,694 as of September 30, 2016, including unpaid salary of $23,256, health insurance of $4,725 and unpaid accounting services, to the Chief Financial Officer s accounting firm for services provided prior to his becoming the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, in the amount of $6,513 as well as services to prepare corporate income tax returns in the amount of $3,200.

Tax years from 2012 through 2015 remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.

There is no income tax benefit for the losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, since management has determined that the realization of the net tax deferred asset is not assured and has created a valuation allowance for the entire amount of such benefits.

NOTE 10   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 

In February 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved amendments extending the term of outstanding warrants to purchase in the aggregate 3,877,970 shares of common stock of the Company at exercise prices ranging from $0.01 per share to $1.00 per share.  These warrants were scheduled to expire at various dates during 2015 and were each extended for an additional one year period from the applicable current expiration date, with the new expiration dates ranging from February 23, 2016 to December 28, 2016.  The increase in fair value of this term extension was $219,051, which was expensed in 2015.  The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the increase in fair value, with the following assumptions for the extended warrants: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 95.1%, risk free interest rate of 0.22%, and expected warrant life of 1.28 years. 

In February 2015, the Company extended options previously granted to two of its executive officers, which included 3,500,000 options exercisable at $0.04 per share.  The increase in fair value of this term extension was $9,692 which was expensed during the period. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the increase in fair value after the extension, with the following assumptions: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 96.4%, risk free interest rate of 0.64%, and expected option life of 2 years.

On January 25, 2016, the Board of Directors approved amendments extending the term of outstanding warrants to purchase in the aggregate 24,372,838 shares of common stock of the Company at exercise prices ranging from $0.01 per share to $3.00 per share (the  Warrants ).  These Warrants were scheduled to expire at various dates during 2016 and were each extended for an additional one year period from the applicable current expiration date, with the new expiration dates ranging from January 26, 2017 to December 28, 2017.  The increase in fair value of this term extension was $1,305,411 which was expensed during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the increase in fair value, with the following assumptions for the extended warrants: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 161.3%, risk free interest rate of 0.47%, and expected warrant life of 1.27 years.

On April 14, 2016, the Company appointed a new Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, with such appointments taking effect on April 18, 2016.  In connection with his appointment, the Company also simultaneously entered into an Employment Agreement with the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, pursuant to which he will be employed on an at will basis at an annual salary of $240,000 during the first year of employment.  He also received options to purchase 3,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.90 per share, vesting over three years and 500,000 shares of restricted stock, 250,000 of which vest immediately and the remainder vest on the one year anniversary of his employment.   The options were valued at $196,505 fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value, with the following assumptions: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 121.7%, risk free interest rate of 1.24%, and expected option life of 5 years. 

A restricted stock award ( RSA ) is an award of common shares that is subject to certain restrictions during a specified period. Restricted stock awards are independent of option grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the release of the restrictions. The grantee cannot transfer the shares before the restricted shares vest. Shares of nonvested restricted stock have the same voting rights as common stock, are entitled to receive dividends and other distributions thereon and are considered to be currently issued and outstanding. The Company s restricted stock awards generally vest over a period of one year. The Company expenses the cost of the restricted stock awards, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, straight-line over the period during which the restrictions lapse. For these purposes, the fair market value of the restricted stock is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date.  The RSAs were valued at $55,000 based on the market price of the shares on the issuance date, which was $0.11.  The value of the 250,000 RSAs that vested immediately, or $27,500, was expensed immediately and the remainder was recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 $6,875 and $38,958 was expensed and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 $0 was expensed.

The remaining value of the previous CEO s RSAs included in deferred compensation in the amount of $48,125 was reclassified to additional paid in capital upon her resignation and the Company reversed expense of $10,312 relative to her departure.

NOTE 11   STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

During 2008, the Board of Directors ( Board ) of the Company adopted the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2008 Plan ) that was approved by the shareholders.  Under the Plan, the Company is authorized to grant options to purchase up to 25,000,000 shares of common stock to any officer, other employee or director of, or any consultant or other independent contractor who provides services to the Company.  The Plan is intended to permit stock options granted to employees under the 2008 Plan to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ( Incentive Stock Options ).  All options granted under the 2008 Plan, which are not intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options are deemed to be non-qualified options ( Non-Statutory Stock Options ).  As of September 30, 2016, options to purchase 9,343,333 shares of common stock have been issued and are unexercised, and 3,806,667 shares are available for grants under the 2008 Plan.  

During 2013, the Board adopted the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2013 Plan ), which was approved by stockholders at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders.  Under the 2013 Plan, the Company is authorized to grant awards of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards of up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of common stock to any officer, employee, director or consultant.  The 2013 Plan is intended to permit stock options granted to employees under the 2013 Plan to qualify as Incentive Stock Options.  All options granted under the 2013 Plan, which are not intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options are deemed to be Non-Statutory Stock Options.  As of September 30, 2016, under the 2013 Plan grants of restricted stock and options to purchase 1,984,166 shares of common stock have been issued and are unvested or unexercised, and 3,015,834 shares of common stock remain available for grants under the 2013 Plan.  

The 2008 Plan and 2013 Plan are administered by the Board or its compensation committee, which determines the persons to whom awards will be granted, the number of awards to be granted, and the specific terms of each grant, including the vesting thereof, subject to the terms of the applicable Plan.

In connection with Incentive Stock Options, the exercise price of each option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant (or 110% of the fair market value in the case of a grantee holding more than 10% of the outstanding stock of the Company).

Prior to January 1, 2014, volatility in all instances presented is the Company s estimate of volatility that is based on the volatility of other public companies that are in closely related industries to the Company.  Beginning January 1, 2014, volatility in all instances presented is the Company s estimate of volatility that is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock.

The following table summarizes the activities for the Company s stock options for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

(1) 
 The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing stock price of $0.40 for our common stock on September 30, 2016. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the period was $142,980.  The fair value of stock options is expensed over the vesting or contractual term in accordance with the terms of the related stock option agreements.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed $94,502 and $257,275 with respect to the options.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company expensed $37,679 and $317,655 with respect to the options.

As of September 30, 2016 there was $374,376 of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what the Company has estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from the Company s expectations. The difference between the stock options exercisable at September 30, 2016 and the stock options exercisable and expected to vest relates to management s estimate of options expected to vest in the future.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Overview

Virtual Piggy, Inc. (the  Company,   we , or  us ) was incorporated in Delaware on February 11, 2008 under the name Chimera International Group, Inc.  On April 4, 2008, we amended our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Moggle, Inc.  On August 22, 2011, we filed a Certificate of Ownership with the Secretary of State of Delaware, pursuant to which the Company s newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Virtual Piggy Incorporated was merged into and with the Company (the  Merger ). In connection with the Merger and in accordance with Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the name of the Company was changed from  Moggle, Inc.  to  Virtual Piggy, Inc.   Our principal offices are located at 265 Sunrise Boulevard, Palm Beach, Florida and our telephone number is (561) 220-0408.

On December 3, 2015, the Company incorporated a newly-formed wholly-owned Subsidiary, Finity, Inc.  On December 11, 2015, the Company filed a Statement of Correction with the Pennsylvania Department of State, to change the name of Finity, Inc. to Finitii, Inc.  The purpose of Finitii, Inc. is to teach children financial responsibility as a not for profit organization. Finitii, Inc. has had no operations since its formation.

The Company is a technology company that seeks to deliver an online ecommerce solution for the family. The Company s system allows parents and their children to manage, allocate funds and track their expenditures, savings and charitable giving online. The system is designed to allow a minor to transact online without a credit card by gaining the parents  permission ahead of time and allowing the parent to set up the rules of use. The Company s Oink product offering was discontinued in March 2016.

Management believes that a future alternative for Virtual Piggy s technology will revolve around the FinTech industry with a partner-first go to market model in which established payments market leaders and vertical market participants can incorporate and integrate the Company s platform into co-branded payments solutions targeting youth and family.  Management believes this approach will enable the Company to reduce expenses while broadening its reach.

Within this affinity partner model, the Company will seek to incorporate licensing fees and customization services.  This would enable the Company to begin creating shareholder value above and beyond consumer transaction fees.

In addition, we are analyzing specific components of our technology for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the Business to Business ( B2B ) realm.

To date we have not generated material revenues.  For the first quarter of 2016, we earned revenue by charging a percentage to the merchant or gaming publisher for each transaction processed, which continued until March 2016, when the decision was made to discontinue the Oink product offering.  As we proceed through 2016, we intend to seek additional revenue streams by generating licensing and customization fees from our co-branding partners.

The Company is currently adding enhancements to the platform, to enable the platform to update itself with any new regulations that are passed, in order to reduce costs associated with manually updating the platform.  This will enable the Company to market the platform to other companies in need of a solution to comply with COPPA or other regulatory requirements.

Strategic Outlook

We believe that the virtual goods market and the FinTech industry will continue to grow over the long term.  Within the market and industry, we intend to provide services to allow transactions with children in compliance with COPPA and similar international privacy laws.  We believe that this particular opportunity is relatively untapped and will seek to be a leading provider of online transactions for children.

Sustained spending on technology, our ability to raise additional financing, the continued growth of the FinTech industry, and compliance with regulatory and reporting requirements are all external conditions that may affect our ability to execute our business plan.  In addition, the FinTech industry is intensely competitive, and most participants have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, customer service and other resources, and greater name recognition.  In addition, certain potential customers, particularly large organizations, may view our small size and limited financial resources as a negative even if they prefer our offering to those of our competitors.

19 

Table of Contents 

Our primary strategic objective over the next 12 -18 months is to increase the value of the underlying technical assets of the Company by incorporating new essential functionality that will act as a key differentiator in the financial services market.  These new technology advances should augment our current portfolio of patents that would give the Company a competitive advantage.  In addition, the Company is redirecting its marketing efforts to increase its user base by entering into affinity marketing agreements with companies targeting specific user communities.  This would increase our potential user community while bringing in development and licensing revenue for those sectors.  This approach would greatly reduce the expense associated with direct marketing efforts.

Within this affinity partner model, the Company will seek to incorporate licensing fees and customization services.  This would enable the Company to begin creating shareholder value above and beyond consumer transaction fees.

As our service grows, we intend to hire additional information technology staff to maintain our product offerings and develop new products to increase our market share.

We believe that our near-term success will depend particularly on our ability to develop customer awareness and confidence in our service.  Since we have limited capital resources, we will need to closely manage our expenses and conserve our cash by continually monitoring any increase in expenses and reducing or eliminating unnecessary expenditures. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development, particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets, that we have limited financial resources, and face an uncertain economic environment. We may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties.

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

The following discussion analyzes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The following information should be considered together with our condensed financial statements for such period and the accompanying notes thereto.

Net Revenue/Net Loss 

We have not generated significant revenue since our inception. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated sales of $13 and $4,856.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of $682,768 and $725,952. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $4,200 as compared to $131,987 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $127,787. The Company closed its sales office in England in September of 2015 and reduced the sales force in 2015 that was not replenished in 2016, as the Company focuses on enhancements to the platform.

Product Development 

Product development expenses were $136,395 and $283,310 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a decrease of $146,915. The decrease is related to cost containment initiatives, including reduction of staff, while still emphasizing enhancements to the platform, which will benefit the Company.

Integration and Customer Support 

Integration and customer support expenses decreased $41,430 to $4,680 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $46,110 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was a result of the Company terminating its prepaid card business, thus requiring minimal customer support in the winding down process.

The increase in interest expense was a result of issuing short term notes in latter part of 2015 and continuing this process in the first two quarters of 2016, in order to continue operations.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

The following discussion analyzes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The following information should be considered together with our condensed financial statements for such period and the accompanying notes thereto.

Net Revenue/Net Loss 

We have not generated significant revenue since our inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we generated sales of $1,050 and $14,242.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of $3,548,683 and $6,038,875.

Product development expenses were $552,534 and $1,380,102 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a decrease of $827,568. The decrease is related to cost containment initiatives, including reduction of staff, while still emphasizing enhancements to the platform, which will benefit the Company.

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses decreased $197,375 to $2,479,678 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2,677,053 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease resulted from the reduction of staff and expenses to a level commensurate with the Company s operations.  The decrease would be more substantial, however, during the first quarter of 2016, there was a revaluation of warrants in the amount of $1,305,411, compared to revaluations in the first quarter of 2015 amounting to $228,743.

Strategic Consulting 

Strategic consulting expenses were $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $340,167 from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company did not require any strategic consulting for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Interest Expense 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred interest expense of $409,563 as compared to $165,984 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $243,579. The increase in interest expense was a result of issuing short term notes in latter part of 2015 and continuing this process in the first two quarters of 2016, in order to continue operations.

Other income 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $1,085 for the sale of one of its domain names.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash used in operating activities decreased $3,567,018 to $1,298,610 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $4,865,628 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in the net loss from operations as explained previously.

Net cash used in investing activities was $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $35,735 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  As a result of cost containment measures, the Company did not invest in any capital expenditures.

Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $1,846,600 to $1,568,700 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $3,415,300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of notes payable to provide capital to continue operations.

As we have not realized significant revenues since our inception, we have financed our operations through private offerings of debt and equity securities.  We do not currently maintain a line of credit or term loan with any commercial bank or other financial institution.  

Since our inception, we have focused on developing and implementing our business plan.  We believe that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to sustain our operations during the next twelve months.    We currently need to generate sufficient revenues to support our cost structure to enable us to pay ongoing costs and expenses as they are incurred, finance the development of our platform, and execute the business plan.  If we cannot generate sufficient revenue to fund our business plan, we intend to seek to raise such financing through the sale of debt and/or equity securities.  The issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to existing shareholders.  If we are unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to us, we will be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay costs and expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Even if we are successful in generating sufficient revenue or in raising sufficient capital in order to complete the platform, our ability to continue in business as a viable going concern can only be achieved when our revenues reach a level that sustains our business operations.  The launch of the platform is expected now in the first quarter of 2017, as we have not been able to obtain financing as quickly as we had anticipated, however, we do not project that significant revenue will be developed until later in 2017. There can be no assurance that we will raise sufficient proceeds, or any proceeds, for us to implement fully our proposed business plan.  Moreover there can be no assurance that even if platform is developed and launched, that we will generate revenues sufficient to fund our operations.  In either such situation, we may not be able to continue our operations and our business might fail.

As of November 14, 2016, the Company has a cash position of approximately $340,000.  Based upon the current cash position and the Company s planned expense run rate, management believes the Company will be able to finance its operations through November 2016.

The foregoing forward-looking information was prepared by us in good faith based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. No assurance can be given, however, regarding the attainability of the projections or the reliability of the assumptions on which they are based. The projections are subject to the uncertainties inherent in any attempt to predict the results of our operations, especially where new products and services are involved. Certain of the assumptions used will inevitably not materialize and unanticipated events will occur. Actual results of operations are, therefore, likely to vary from the projections and such variations may be material and adverse to us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that such results will be achieved. Moreover due to changes in technology, new product announcements, competitive pressures, system design and/or other specifications we may be required to change the current plans. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2016, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management.

Stock-based Compensation 

We have adopted the fair value recognition provisions Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ( FASB ASC ) 718. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107   Share-Based Payment   ( SAB 107 ) in March, 2005, which provides supplemental FASB ASC 718 application guidance based on the views of the SEC. Under FASB ASC 718, compensation cost recognized includes compensation cost for all share-based payments granted beginning January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 718.

We have used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the option fair values. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are, expected stock price volatility, the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and the expected option term (the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire).

All issuances of stock options or other equity instruments to non-employees as consideration for goods or services received by the Company are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued.  Non-employee equity based payments that do not vest immediately upon grant are recorded as an expense over the service period, as if the Company had paid cash for the services.  At the end of each financial reporting period, prior to the completion of the services, the fair value of the equity based payments will be re-measured and the non-cash expense recognized during the period will be adjusted accordingly.  Since the fair value of equity based payments granted to non-employees is subject to change in the future, the amount of the future expense will include fair value re-measurements until the equity based payments are fully vested or the service is completed.

Revenue Recognition 

In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (Codified in FASB ASC 605), we will recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of a customer or distributor arrangement exists or acceptance occurs, (ii) a retailer, distributor or wholesaler receives the goods, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability of the sales revenues is reasonably assured. Subject to these criteria, we have generally recognized revenue from Oink and ParentMatch at the time of the sale of the associated product.
