1.  
  Business and basis of presentation       Ulta Salon, Cosmetics   Fragrance, Inc. was incorporated in the
state of Delaware on January 9, 1990, to operate specialty retail stores selling cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products and related accessories and services. The stores also feature full-service salons. As of October 29,
2016, the Company operated 949 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as shown in the table below. As used in these notes and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all references to  we,   us, 
 our,   Ulta,   Ulta Beauty  or the  Company  refer to Ulta Salon, Cosmetics   Fragrance, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.      
   The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s Article 10, Regulation S-X. These consolidated financial statements
were prepared on a consolidated basis to include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and unrealized profit were eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of
management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to fairly state the financial position and results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods
presented.    The Company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of the Company s net sales and net income are
realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. The results for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending January
28, 2017, or for any other future interim period or for any future year.  
      8  

Table of Contents  

  These interim consolidated financial statements and the related notes should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016. All amounts are stated in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts and number of stores.  

2.  
  Summary of significant accounting policies       Information regarding the Company s significant
accounting policies is contained in Note 2,  Summary of significant accounting policies,  to the financial statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016. Presented below and in the
following notes is supplemental information that should be read in conjunction with  Notes to Financial Statements  in the Annual Report.  
  Fiscal quarter     The Company s quarterly periods are
the 13 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. The Company s third quarters in fiscal 2016 and 2015 ended on October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.  
  Share-based compensation     The Company measures
share-based compensation cost on the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognizes the expense on a straight-line method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The Company estimated the grant date fair
value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model using the following weighted-average assumptions for the periods indicated:      
   The Company granted 109 and 295 stock options during the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.
The compensation cost that has been charged against operating income for stock option grants was $1,983 and $1,743 for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. The compensation cost that has been charged
against operating income for stock option grants was $5,965 and $5,682 for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of these options was $52.95 and $57.40,
respectively. At October 29, 2016, there was approximately $22,054 of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options.    The
Company issued 52 and 55 restricted stock units during 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. The compensation cost that has been charged against operating income for restricted stock units was $1,890 and $1,401 for the
13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. The compensation cost that has been charged against operating income for restricted stock units was $5,335 and $4,558 for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October
31, 2015, respectively. At October 29, 2016, there was approximately $13,452 of unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock units.  
 The Company issued 24 and 22 performance-based restricted stock units during the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015,
respectively. The compensation cost that has been charged against operating income for performance-based restricted stock units was $1,468 and $404 for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. The
compensation cost that has been charged against operating income for performance-based restricted stock units was $2,903 and $886 for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. At October 29, 2016, there was
approximately $9,783 of unrecognized compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units.     Recent accounting pronouncements not
yet adopted     In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, issued as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09). The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core
principle is that we will recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU  2015-14  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. With the deferral, the revenue recognition standard is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including  
      9  

Table of Contents  

interim reporting periods with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods. In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (ASU 2016-08) which further clarifies how to implement revenue recognition guidance related to determining whether an entity is a principal or an
agent in a revenue transaction. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (ASU 2016-10) which further clarifies the aspects of (a)
identifying performance obligations and (b) the licensing implementation guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2016-10 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU
2014-09. These standards allow for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the application method and the impact of these new standards on its consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This standard will change the way all leases
of one year or more are treated. Under this guidance, lessees will be required to capitalize virtually all leases on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and recognize an associated financing lease liability or capital lease
liability. The right-of-use asset represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the specified lease term. The lease liability represents the lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease, measured on a discounted basis. Based on certain characteristics, leases are classified as financing leases or operating leases. Financing lease liabilities, those that contain provisions similar to capitalized leases, are
amortized like capital leases under current GAAP as amortization expense and interest expense in the statement of operations. Operating lease liabilities are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease as lease expense in the
statement of operations. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on
its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04, Liabilities   Extinguishments
of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored   Value Products. This update entitles a company to derecognize amounts related to expected breakage to the extent that it is probable a significant
reversal of the recognized breakage amount will not subsequently occur. ASU 2016-04 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This guidance will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Companies will have to
recognize all income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, and additional paid-in capital pools will be eliminated. The guidance on employer s accounting for an employee s use of shares to
satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation and for forfeitures is changing, and two practical expedients for non-public entities have been added. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of
the Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-15 provides classification guidance on certain cash receipts and cash payments, including, but not limited to, debt prepayment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination,
proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 requires a retrospective transition method
applied to each period presented. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Corporation s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.    Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
    In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of
an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. This update clarifies the accounting for share-based awards with performance targets. ASU 2014-12 is effective for public companies for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim reporting periods. As permitted, the Company adopted this standard, prospectively, in its first quarter ended April 30, 2016 and its adoption had no impact on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles   Goodwill and Other
  Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customers  Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This standard provides guidance to determine whether a cloud-based computing arrangement includes a software
license. If a cloud-based computing arrangement includes a software license,  
      10

the customer must account for the software element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. Otherwise, the customer must account for the arrangement as
a service contract. As permitted, the Company adopted this standard, prospectively, in its first quarter ended April 30, 2016 and its adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

3.  
  Commitments and contingencies         Leases     The Company leases retail stores,
distribution and office facilities and certain equipment. Original non-cancelable lease terms range from three to ten years and leases generally contain renewal options for additional years. Total rent expense under operating leases was
$51,580 and $46,550 for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. Total rent expense under operating leases was $150,424 and $134,851 for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. 
   General litigation     The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business, including
three putative employment class action lawsuits in California, each of which has settled. One case received final court approval and the remaining two cases are in the process of obtaining court approval. In the opinion of management, the
amount of any liability with respect to these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.  

4.  
  Notes payable       In 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder, Wells Fargo Capital Finance LLC as a Lender, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as a Lender, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a Lender and PNC Bank,
National Association, as a Lender, which has been amended multiple times since 2011 (as amended, the Loan Agreement). The Loan Agreement currently matures in December 2018, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $200,000 or a
percentage of eligible owned inventory, contains a $10,000 subfacility for letters of credit and allows the Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $50,000, subject to consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan
Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of excess borrowing availability at all times. Substantially all of the Company s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the
facility. Outstanding borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate plus 1.50% and the unused line fee is 0.20%.  
 As of October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and the Company was in
compliance with all terms and covenants of the agreement.      

5.  
  Investments       The Company s short-term investments as of October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 and
October 31, 2015 consist of $110,000, $130,000 and $150,209, respectively, in certificates of deposit. These short-term investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value and are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in
Short-term investments. The contractual maturity of the Company s investments was less than twelve months at October 29, 2016.      

6.  
  Fair Value Measurements       The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximates their estimated fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments.    Fair value is measured using inputs from the
three levels of the fair value hierarchy, which are described as follows:      

Level 1   observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.        

Level 2   inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data.    

Level 3   unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which would require the Company to develop its own assumptions.    
 As of October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, the Company held financial liabilities of $10,955, $7,491 and $7,858, respectively, related to
its non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The liabilities have been categorized as Level 2 as they are based on third-party reported net asset values, which are based primarily on quoted market prices of underlying assets of the funds
within the plan.

7.  
  Net income per common share       The following is a reconciliation of net income and the number of shares of
common stock used in the computation of net income per basic and diluted share:      
   The denominators for diluted net income per common share for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 exclude
21 and 293 employee stock options and restricted stock units, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effects. The denominators for diluted net income per common share for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015 exclude 184
and 409 employee stock options and restricted stock, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effects. Outstanding performance-based restricted stock units are included in the computation of dilutive shares only to the extent that the
underlying performance conditions are satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the results would be dilutive under the
treasury stock method.     

8.  
  Share repurchase program       On September 11, 2014, the Company announced that the Board of Directors
authorized a share repurchase program (the 2014 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to $300,000 of the Company s common stock. The 2014 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously
authorized, but unused amounts of $112,664 from the share repurchase program adopted in 2013. On March 12, 2015, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an increase of $100,000 to the 2014 Share Repurchase Program effective
March 17, 2015. The 2014 Share Repurchase Program did not have an expiration date, but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time.    On
March 10, 2016, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2016 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $425,000 of the Company s common stock. The
2016 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized, but unused amounts of $172,386 from the 2014 Share Repurchase Program. The 2016 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or
discontinued at any time.   As part of the 2016 Share Repurchase Program, the Company entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) agreement with
Goldman, Sachs   Co. to repurchase $200,000 of the Company s common stock. Under the ASR agreement, the Company paid $200,000 to Goldman, Sachs   Co. and received an initial delivery of 852 shares in the first quarter of 2016,
which were retired and represented 80% of the total shares the Company expected to receive based on the market price at the time of the initial delivery. In May 2016, the ASR settled and an additional 153 shares were delivered to the Company
and retired. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement was determined with reference to the average price of the Company s common stock over the term of the agreement. The transaction was accounted for as an equity
transaction. The par value of shares received was recorded as a reduction to common stock with the remainder recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. Upon receipt of the shares, there was an immediate
reduction in the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share.

 Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.    References in the following discussion to  we,   us,   our, 
 Ulta,   Ulta Beauty,  the  Company,  and similar references mean Ulta Salon, Cosmetics   Fragrance, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.  
  Overview     We were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at
a time when prestige, mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels   department stores for prestige products, drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional
hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers All Things Beauty, All in One Place TM , a compelling value proposition and a convenient and welcoming shopping
environment. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance.    We are
currently the largest beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products and hair care products and salon services. We focus on providing affordable indulgence to our guests by
combining unmatched product breadth, value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer. Key aspects of our business include: our ability to offer our guests a unique combination of more than 20,000
beauty products across the  
      13  

Table of Contents  

categories of prestige and mass cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and salon styling tools, as well as a full-service salon in every store featuring hair, skin and
brow services; our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our guests across all of our product categories; and convenience, as our stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power centers.  
 The continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our six strategic
imperatives: 1) acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests, 2) differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels, 3) offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite
our guests, 4) deliver exceptional services in three core areas: hair, skin health and brows, 5) grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests and 6) invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth, and capture scale
efficiencies. We believe that the expanding U.S. beauty products and salon services industry, the shift in distribution channel of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores, coupled with Ulta Beauty s
competitive strengths, positions us to capture additional market share in the industry.    Comparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within
the retail industry. Our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales, including general U.S. economic conditions, changes in
merchandise strategy or mix and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others.    Over the long-term, our growth strategy is to
increase total net sales through increases in our comparable sales, by opening new stores and by increasing sales in our e-commerce channel. Operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and
leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people, systems and supply chain required to support a 1,400 to 1,700 store chain with a successful e-commerce business
and competitive omni-channel capabilities.     Basis of presentation   
 We have determined the operating segments on the same basis that we use to internally evaluate performance. We have combined our three operating
segments: retail stores, salon services and e-commerce, into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumers, economic characteristics, nature of products and distribution methods.  
 Net sales include store and e-commerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue. We recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our
retail stores and e-commerce sales are recorded based on delivery of merchandise to the guest. Merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided. Gift card
sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales.  
 Comparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our
comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one month grand opening period. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of
operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior
period. Comparable sales include the Company s e-commerce business. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales.  
 Measuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy. Several factors
could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results:      

the general national, regional and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels;    

the introduction of new products or brands;    

the location of new stores in existing store markets;    

competition;    

our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences;    

the effectiveness of our various marketing activities; and   

the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores.      Cost of
sales includes:      

the cost of merchandise sold (retail and e-commerce), including substantially all vendor allowances, which are treated as a reduction of merchandise costs;    
      14  

Table of Contents  

warehousing and distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities and insurance;    

store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, licenses and cleaning expenses;    

salon payroll and benefits;    

customer loyalty program expense; and    

shrink and inventory valuation reserves.      Our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an
increasing number of stores. Changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute
their cost of sales.    Selling, general and administrative expenses include:      

payroll, bonus and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees;    

advertising and marketing costs;    

credit card program incentives;    

occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities;    

stock-based compensation expense;    

depreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail and warehouse operations, which are included in cost of sales; and    

legal, finance, information systems and other corporate overhead costs.      This presentation of items in
selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.  
 Pre-opening expenses include non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled and relocated stores including rent during
the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand opening advertising.    Interest
income, net includes both interest income and expense. Interest income represents interest from short-term investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense includes interest costs and unused
facility fees associated with our credit facility, which is structured as an asset-based lending instrument. Our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure, which can result in increased cost in periods of rising
interest rates.   Income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we
operate stores.

   Results of operations   
 Our quarterly periods are the 13 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31. The Company s third
quarters in fiscal 2016 and 2015 ended on October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that
period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.    The following table
presents the components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:      
 
      16  

Table of Contents  

   Comparison of 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 to 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015   
   Net sales      Net sales increased $220.5 million or
24.2%, to $1,131.2 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $910.7 million for the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Salon service sales increased $8.7 million or 16.7%, to $60.4 million compared to $51.7 million in the third
quarter of 2015. E-commerce sales increased $27.4 million or 59.1%, to $73.6 million compared to $46.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The net sales increase is due to comparable stores driving an increase of $147.9 million and an
increase in non-comparable stores of $72.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2015.   The 16.7% comparable sales increase consisted of an 14.3%
increase at the Company s retail and salon stores and a 59.1% increase in the Company s e-commerce business. The inclusion of the e-commerce business resulted in an increase of approximately 240 basis points to the Company s
consolidated same store sales calculation for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to 190 basis points for the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The total comparable sales increase included a 11.1% increase in transactions and a 5.6%
increase in average ticket. We attribute the increase in comparable sales to our successful marketing and merchandising strategies.      Gross
profit      Gross profit increased $91.4 million or 27.2%, to $427.1 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $335.6 million for
the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 90 basis points to 37.8% for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to 36.9% for the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The increase in gross
profit margin was primarily due to improvements in merchandise margins, driven by our marketing and merchandising strategies, and leverage in fixed store costs, attributed to the impact of higher sales volume, partly offset by planned supply chain
deleverage related to supply chain investments.      Selling, general and administrative expenses    
 Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses increased $61.7 million or 28.2%, to $280.5 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared
to $218.8 million for the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses increased 80 basis points to 24.8% for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to 24.0% for the 13 weeks ended October 31,
2015. The deleverage in SG A expenses is primarily due to investments to support our growth initiatives and deleverage of corporate overhead costs, in part due to a $1.8 million impairment charge related to a Louisiana store closure
impacted by the August floods. This was partly offset by leverage in marketing expense attributed to strong sales growth.     Pre-opening expenses
     Pre-opening expenses increased $0.8 million to $6.9 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $6.1 million for the 13 weeks
ended October 31, 2015. During the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, we opened 42 new stores, relocated one store and remodeled six stores, compared to 45 new store openings, two store relocations and two remodeled stores during the 13 weeks
ended October 31, 2015.      Interest income, net    
 Interest income, net was insignificant for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 and October 31, 2015. Interest income results from short-term investments
with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense represents various fees related to the credit facility. We did not utilize our credit facility during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 or 2015. 
   Income tax expense      Income tax expense of $52.3
million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 represents an effective tax rate of 37.4%, compared to $40.0 million of tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 36.0% for the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The higher tax rate is
primarily due to benefits in the prior year related to changes in state income tax rates.

    Net income    
 Net income increased $16.5 million or 23.2%, to $87.6 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $71.1 million for the 13 weeks ended October
31, 2015. The increase is primarily related to the $91.4 million increase in gross profit, offset by a $61.7 million increase in SG A expenses and a $12.3 million increase in income tax expense.  
  Comparison of 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 to 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015   
   Net sales      Net sales increased $618.3 million or
23.3%, to $3,274.2 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $2,655.8 million for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Salon service sales increased $23.5 million or 15.2%, to $178.2 million compared to $154.7 million in the
first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015. E-commerce sales increased $64.2 million or 50.8%, to $190.5 million compared to $126.3 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015. The net sales increase is due to comparable stores driving an increase of
$401.7 million and an increase in non-comparable stores of $216.6 million compared to the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015.   The 15.4% comparable sales
increase consisted of a 13.6% increase at the Company s retail and salon stores and a 50.8% increase in the Company s e-commerce business. The inclusion of the e-commerce business resulted in an increase of approximately 180 basis
points to the Company s consolidated same store sales calculation for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 compared to 150 basis points for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The total comparable sales increase included a 10.6% increase
in transactions and a 4.8% increase in average ticket. We attribute the increase in comparable sales to our successful marketing and merchandising strategies.  
   Gross profit      Gross profit increased $257.0
million or 27.2%, to $1,202.3 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $945.3 million for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 110 basis points to 36.7% for the 39 weeks
ended October 29, 2016, compared to 35.6% for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to improvements in merchandise margins, driven by our marketing and merchandising strategies, and leverage
in fixed store costs, attributed to the impact of higher sales volume, partly offset by planned supply chain deleverage related to our new distribution centers.  
   Selling, general and administrative expenses    
 Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses increased $162.4 million or 27.3%, to $757.6 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared
to $595.2 million for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses increased 70 basis points to 23.1% for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to 22.4% for the 39 weeks ended October 31,
2015. The deleverage in SG A expenses is primarily due to investments to support our growth initiatives and deleverage of corporate overhead costs, in part due to impairment charges related to the closure of stores in Chicago and
Louisiana. This was partly offset by leverage in marketing expense.     Pre-opening expenses    
 Pre-opening expenses increased $0.9 million to $14.2 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $13.3 million for the 39 weeks ended October
31, 2015. During the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, we opened 79 new stores, relocated two stores and remodeled eleven stores, compared to 89 new store openings, four store relocations and four remodeled stores during the 39 weeks ended
October 31, 2015.      Interest income, net    
 Interest income, net was $0.8 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $0.9 million for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. Interest
income results from short-term investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense represents various fees related to the credit facility. We did not utilize our credit facility during the first
39 weeks of fiscal 2016 or 2015.

    Income tax expense    
 Income tax expense of $161.8 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016 represents an effective tax rate of 37.5%, compared to $125.5 million of tax
expense representing an effective tax rate of 37.2% for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The higher tax rate is primarily due to benefits in the prior year related to changes in state income tax rates.  
   Net income      Net income increased $57.4 million or
27.0%, to $269.5 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $212.2 million for the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. The increase is primarily related to the $257.0 million increase in gross profit, offset by a $162.4 million
increase in SG A expenses and a $36.3 million increase in income tax expense.     Liquidity and capital resources   
 Our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new, relocated and remodeled stores, increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and
new brand additions, in-store boutiques (sets of custom designed fixtures configured to prominently display certain prestige brands within our stores), supply chain improvements, share repurchases and for continued improvements in our information
technology systems.   Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, short-term investments and cash flows from operations, including changes in working
capital, and borrowings under our credit facility. The most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
 Our working capital needs are greatest from August through November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for the approaching
holiday season. This is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements. Based on past performance
and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, short-term investments, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will satisfy the Company s working capital needs, capital expenditure needs, commitments and
other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months.    The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:
     
    Operating activities   
 Operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation,
realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment and the effect of working capital changes.    Merchandise inventories were $1,137.0 million
at October 29, 2016, compared to $884.4 million at October 31, 2015, representing an increase of $252.6 million. Average inventory per store increased 16.5% compared to the prior year. The increase in inventory is primarily due to the
following:      

approximately $131 million due to the opening of the Company s fourth and fifth distribution centers in Greenwood, Indiana and Dallas, Texas; and    

approximately $30 million due to strong sales, new brand additions and incremental inventory for in-store boutiques.    
 Deferred rent liabilities were $361.7 million at October 29, 2016, compared to $324.3 million at October 31, 2015, representing an increase of $37.4
million. Deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances, future rental increases and rent holidays, which are all recognized on a straight-line basis over their respective lease term. The increase is primarily due to the addition
of 89 net new stores opened since October 31, 2015.

   Investing activities   
 We have historically used cash primarily for new, relocated and remodeled stores, supply chain investments, short-term investments and investments in
information technology systems. Investment activities related to capital expenditures were $281.2 million during the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to $231.9 million during the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015, representing an
increase of $49.3 million. The increase in capital expenditures year over year is primarily due to investments in information technology systems, supply chain initiatives, and merchandise fixtures, partially offset by the decrease in the number
of new store openings during the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, compared to the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015. As of October 29, 2016, we had $110.0 million of short-term investments, which consist of certificates of deposit with maturities
of twelve months or less from the date of purchase.    Financing activities   
 Financing activities in fiscal 2016 and 2015 consist principally of capital stock transactions and the related income tax effects and our stock repurchase
program. Purchase of treasury shares in fiscal 2016 and 2015 represents the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of
restricted stock.    We had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as of October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 or October 31, 2015. The zero
outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth, overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions. We may require
borrowings under the credit facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program or seasonal inventory needs.      Share
repurchase program      On September 11, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2014 Share
Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to $300 million of the Company s common stock. The 2014 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized, but unused amounts of $112.7 million
from the share repurchase program adopted in 2013. On March 12, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $100 million to the 2014 Share Repurchase Program effective March 17, 2015. The 2014 Share Repurchase
Program did not have an expiration date, but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time.   On March 10, 2016, we announced that our Board of
Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2016 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $425 million of the Company s common stock. The 2016 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked
the previously authorized, but unused amounts of $172.4 million from the 2014 Share Repurchase Program. The 2016 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 As part of the 2016 Share Repurchase Program, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) agreement with Goldman, Sachs   Co. to repurchase $200
million of the Company s common stock. Under the ASR agreement, the Company paid $200 million to Goldman, Sachs   Co. and received an initial delivery of 851,653 shares in the first quarter of 2016, which were retired and represented
80% of the total shares the Company expected to receive based on the market price at the time of the initial delivery. In May 2016, the ASR settled and an additional 153,418 shares were delivered to the Company and retired. The final
number of shares delivered upon settlement was determined with reference to the average price of the Company s common stock over the term of the agreement. The transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. The par value of
shares received was recorded as a reduction to common stock with the remainder recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. Upon receipt of the shares, there was an immediate reduction in the weighted average
common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share.    During the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016, excluding the shares repurchased under
the ASR, we purchased 444,523 shares of common stock for $97.0 million at an average price of $218.18. During the 39 weeks ended October 31, 2015, we purchased 772,076 shares of common stock for $121.3 million at an average price of
$157.05.     Credit facility      In 2011, we entered
into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder, Wells Fargo Capital Finance LLC as a Lender, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as a
Lender, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a Lender and PNC Bank, National Association, as a Lender, which has been amended multiple times since 2011 (as amended, the Loan Agreement). The Loan Agreement currently matures in December

2018, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $200 million or a percentage of eligible owned inventory, contains a $10 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the
Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $50 million, subject to consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of excess borrowing availability at all
times. Substantially all of the Company s assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility. Outstanding borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate plus 1.50% and the
unused line fee is 0.20%.    As of October 29, 2016, January 30, 2016 and October 31, 2015, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and
the Company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the agreement.     Off-balance sheet arrangements   
 As of October 29, 2016, we have not entered into any  off-balance sheet  arrangements, as that term is described by the SEC.  
  Contractual obligations     Our contractual obligations
consist of operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and our revolving line of credit. No material changes outside the ordinary course of business have occurred in our contractual obligations during the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2016.
    Critical accounting policies and estimates   
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may
differ from these estimates. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016.

Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       Market risk represents the risk of loss that
may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading
purposes.     Interest rate sensitivity     We are exposed
to interest rate risks primarily under our credit facility when we borrow. Interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates. We did not access our credit facility during the 39 week period ended October 29, 2016. The interest
expense recognized in our statement of income represents unused fees associated with the credit facility. Interest expense is offset by interest income from short-term investments with maturities of twelve months or less from the date of
purchase.      

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures over Financial Reporting
    We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who
certify our financial reports and to the members of our senior management and Board of Directors.  
      21  

Table of Contents  

  Based on management s evaluation as of October 29, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 There were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting during the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.       Part II - Other

  Risk Factors       In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully
consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, financial results or future
performance. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 30, 2016.

  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds       The following table sets forth repurchases
of our common stock during the third quarter of 2016:

 There were 179,042 shares repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program during the three months ended October 29, 2016 and there were 1,378 shares transferred from employees in satisfaction of
minimum statutory tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock during the period.        

(2) 
 On September 11, 2014, we announced the 2014 Share Repurchase Program pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to $300 million of the Company s common stock. The 2014 Share Repurchase Program
authorization revoked the previously authorized, but unused amounts of $112.7 million from the share repurchase program adopted in 2013. On March 12, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $100 million to the
2014 Share Repurchase Program effective March 17, 2015. The 2014 Share Repurchase Program did not have an expiration date and could be suspended or discontinued at any time.
