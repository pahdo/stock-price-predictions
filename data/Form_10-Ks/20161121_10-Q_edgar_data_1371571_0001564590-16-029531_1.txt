EXPLANATORY NOTE 
   
 PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Trust (the   Trust  ) is a Delaware statutory trust organized in two separate series - PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund and PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund (each a   Fund   and collectively the   Funds  ).  Since the Trust s commencement of investment operations on February 15, 2007, the managing owner has filed separate quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for each of the Funds beginning with the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2007.  Duplicate versions of the Forms 10-Q for each Fund have similarly been filed for the Trust.  As such, the Form 10-Q for each Fund could be located in the applicable Fund s EDGAR Company Filings page and the Forms 10-Q for both Funds could be located in the Trust s EDGAR Company Filings page. Although the Form 10-Qs have historically been filed in duplicate for both the Trust and the Funds, all details included therein, in particular the financial information, are Fund specific. 
   
 Due to an EDGAR tagging error, the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on August 9, 2016 (the   Q2 Forms 10-Q  ) were tagged for each of the Funds but the Trust was not appropriately tagged.  As a result, the Q2 Forms 10-Q can be located in the EDGAR Company Filings page for each of the Funds, as applicable, but they are not located on the EDGAR Company Filings page for the Trust. 
   
 The sole purpose of filing these Q2 Forms 10-Q is to file the Quarterly Reports on behalf of the Trust, among other things, so that they may be reflected on the EDGAR Company Filings page for the Trust.  No changes have been made to any of the Q2 Form 10-Q. Each Q2 Form 10-Q speaks as of the original filing date of such Q2 Form 10-Q, does not reflect events that may have occurred subsequent to the original filing date, and does not modify or update in any way disclosures made in the original Q2 Form 10-Q.

     Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements

(1) Background 
 On October 24, 2014, DB Commodity Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( DBCS ), DB U.S. Financial Markets Holding Corporation ( DBUSH ) and Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC ( Invesco ) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ). DBCS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DBUSH. DBCS agreed to transfer and sell to Invesco all of DBCS  interests in PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Trust (the  Trust ), a Delaware statutory trust, and the Trust s two separate series, one of which is PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund (the  Fund ), including the sole and exclusive power to direct the business and affairs of the Trust and the Fund, as well as certain other assets pertaining to the management of the Trust and the Fund, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement (the  Transaction ). 
 The Transaction was consummated on February 23, 2015 (the  Closing Date ). Invesco now serves as the managing owner (the  Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund, in replacement of DBCS (the  Predecessor Managing Owner ). 

(2) Organization 
 The Fund, a separate series of the Trust, is a Delaware statutory trust organized in two separate series, was formed on August 3, 2006. The Predecessor Managing Owner seeded the Fund with a capital contribution of $1,000 in exchange for 40 General Shares of the Fund. The General Shares were sold to the Managing Owner by the Predecessor Managing Owner pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the  Trust Agreement ). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. 
 The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the  Shares ) only to certain eligible financial institutions (the  Authorized Participants ) in one or more blocks of 200,000 Shares, called a Basket. The Fund commenced investment operations on February 15, 2007. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC (the  NYSE Alternext )) on February 20, 2007 and, as of November 25, 2008, is listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the  NYSE Arca ). 
 This Quarterly Report (the  Report ) covers the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the  Three Months Ended June 30, 2016  and the  Three Months Ended June 30, 2015, respectively) and the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the "Six Months Ended June 30, 2016" and the "Six Months Ended June 30, 2015", respectively). The Fund s performance information from inception up to and excluding the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance associated with the Predecessor Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund since the Closing Date, and the Fund s performance information since the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance associated with the Managing Owner. Past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim period financial statements have been made. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full-year period. These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Fund s financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. 

(3) Fund Investment Overview 
 The Fund establishes short positions in certain futures contracts (the  DX Contracts ) with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index Excess Return (the  Short Index  or the  Index ) over time. The performance of the Fund also is intended to reflect the excess, if any, of its interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) over the expenses of the Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund may hold United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) for margin and/or cash management purposes. 
 10 
 
    The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are traded through the currency markets of ICE Futures U.S. (formerly known as the New York Board of   Trade       ), under the symbol  DX.  The changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts are related to the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the U.S. Dollar Index        (the  USDX        ). The Index provides a g  eneral indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar relative to the six major world currencies (each an  Index Currency,  and collectively, the  Index Currencies ), which comprise the USDX        Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Sw  edish Krona and Swiss Franc.  

(4) Service Providers and Related Party Agreements 
 The Trustee 
 Under the Trust Agreement, Wilmington Trust Company, the trustee of the Trust and the Fund (the  Trustee ), has delegated to the Managing Owner the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of the Trust and the Fund. The Trustee will have no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Managing Owner, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Managing Owner. 
 The Managing Owner 
 The Managing Owner serves as the Fund s commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor and managing owner. The Fund pays the Managing Owner a management fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.75% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Fund (the  Management Fee ). From inception up to and excluding the Closing Date, all Management Fees were payable to the Predecessor Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund since the Closing Date and all Management Fee accruals since the Closing Date have been paid to the Managing Owner. 
 The Fund may, for cash management purposes, invest in money market mutual funds that are managed by an affiliate of the Managing Owner.  Through June 20, 2017, the Managing Owner has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the Fund s management fee in an amount equal to 100% of the net advisory fees an affiliate of the Managing Owner receives that are attributable to the Fund s investments in money market mutual funds managed by that affiliate.   The Managing Owner cannot discontinue this waiver prior to its expiration. 
 The Commodity Trading Advisor 
 Invesco Advisers Inc. ( Invesco Advisers ), a Delaware corporation, is the commodity trading advisor of the Trust and Fund and is an affiliate of the Managing Owner.

The Commodity Broker is responsible, among other things, for providing periodic accountings of all dealings and actions taken by the Trust on behalf of the Fund during the reporting period, together with an accounting of all securities, cash or other indebtedness or obligations held by it or its nominees for or on behalf of the Fund. 
 The Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent 
 The Bank of New York Mellon (the  Administrator  and  Custodian ) is the administrator, custodian and transfer agent of the Fund. The Fund and the Administrator have entered into separate administrative, custodian, transfer agency and service agreements (collectively referred to as the  Administration Agreement ). 
   Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator performs or supervises the performance of services necessary for the operation and administration of the Fund (other than making investment decisions), including receiving and processing orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Baskets, net asset value calculations, accounting and other fund administrative services. The Administrator maintains certain financial books and records, including: Basket creation and redemption books and records, fund accounting records, ledgers with respect to assets, liabilities, capital, income and expenses, the registrar, transfer journals  
 11 
 
  and related details, and trading and related documents   received from the Commodity Broker. The Managing Owner pays the Administrator fees for its services out of the Management Fee.  
 As of December 31, 2014, the Fund held $1,829,181 of cash and $42,998,854 of United States Treasury Obligations at the Commodity Broker. In conjunction with the Transaction, during the three-day period from February 24, 2015 to February 26, 2015, the Fund transferred $500,000 of cash and $35,999,668 of United States Treasury Obligations from the Commodity Broker to the Custodian. The Fund s open positions of currency futures contracts remained with the Commodity Broker as well as $4,000,000 of United States Treasury Obligations to satisfy maintenance margin requirements and $2,052,858 of cash to satisfy variation margin requirements for open currency futures contracts. Effective February 26, 2015, the Managing Owner began transferring cash daily from the Custodian to the Commodity Broker to satisfy the previous day s variation margin on open futures contracts.  
 The Distributor 
 Effective June 20, 2016, Invesco Distributors, Inc. (the  Distributor ) became distributor and began providing certain distribution services to the Fund. Pursuant to the Distribution Services Agreement among the Managing Owner, the Fund and the Distributor, the Distributor assists the Managing Owner and the Administrator with certain functions and duties relating to distribution and marketing services to the Fund including reviewing and approving marketing materials.

(5) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
 (a) Basis of Presentation  
 The financial statements of the Fund have been prepared using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ). 
 The Fund has determined that it meets the definition of an investment company and has prepared the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP for investment companies in conformity with accounting and reporting guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946    Investment Companies . 
 (b) Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
 12 
 
    (c) Financial Instruments and Fair Value  
 Investment transactions are recorded in the Statements of Financial Condition on a trade date basis at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in each period. U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. 
 U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods, giving the highest priority to readily available unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), generally when market prices are not readily available or are unreliable. Based on the valuation inputs, the securities or other investments are tiered into one of three levels. Changes in valuation methods or market conditions may result in transfers in or out of an investment s assigned level: 

Level 1:   
 
 Prices are determined using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets.    

Level 2:   
 
 Prices are determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants may use in pricing a security. These may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, yield curves, loss severities, default rates, discount rates, volatilities and others.      

Level 3:   
 
 Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable (for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period), unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Fund s own assumptions about the factors market participants would use in determining fair value of the securities or instruments and would be based on the best available information.    

 United States Treasury Obligations are fair valued using an evaluated quote provided by an independent pricing service. Evaluated quotes provided by the pricing service may be determined without exclusive reliance on quoted prices, and may reflect appropriate factors such as developments related to specific securities, yield, quality, type of issue, coupon rate, maturity, individual trading characteristics and other market data. All debt obligations involve some risk of default with respect to interest and/or principal payments. 
 Currency futures contracts are valued at the final settlement price set by an exchange on which they are principally traded. 
 Investments in open-end and closed-end registered investment companies that do not trade on an exchange are valued at the end of day NAV per share. Investments in open-end and closed-end registered investment companies that trade on an exchange are valued at the last sales price or official closing price as of the close of the customary trading session on the exchange where the security is principally traded. 
 When market closing prices are not available, the Managing Owner may value an asset of the Fund pursuant to policies the Managing Owner has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards. 
 The levels assigned to the securities valuations may not be an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with investing in those securities. Because of the inherent uncertainties of valuation, the values reflected in the financial statements may materially differ from the value received upon actual sale of those investments. 
 The following is a summary of the tiered valuation input levels as of June 30, 2016: 

(a)   
 
 Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation).    

 13 
 
    The following is a summary of the tiered valuation input levels as of December 31, 2015:  

(a)   
 
 Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation).    

 (d) Deposits with Commodity Broker and Custodian 
 The Fund deposits cash and United States Treasury Obligations with its Commodity Broker subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the  CFTC ) regulations and various exchange and broker requirements. The combination of the Fund s deposits with its Commodity Broker of cash and United States Treasury Obligations and the unrealized profit or loss on open futures contracts represents the Fund s overall equity in its broker trading account. To meet the Fund s maintenance margin requirements, the Fund holds United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund transfers cash to the Commodity Broker to satisfy variation margin requirements. The Fund earns interest on any excess cash deposited with the Commodity Broker and incurs interest expense on any deficit balance with the Commodity Broker. 
 The Fund s remaining cash, United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds holdings are on deposit with its Custodian. 
 (e) Investment Transactions and Investment Income 
 Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains (losses) from the sale or disposition of securities or derivatives are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statements of Income and Expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the sale or disposition occurs, respectively. 
 Interest income on United States Treasury Obligations is recognized on an accrual basis when earned. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the United States Treasury Obligations. Dividend income (net of withholding tax, if any) is recorded on the ex-dividend date.  
 (f) Receivable/(Payable) for Shares Issued and Redeemed 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order to create or redeem Shares of the Fund. Cash settlement occurs at the creation order settlement date or the redemption order settlement date as discussed in Note 7. 
 (g) Cash Held by Commodity Broker 
 The Fund s arrangement with the Commodity Broker requires the Fund to meet its variation margin requirement related to the price movements on futures contracts held by the Fund by maintaining cash on deposit with the Commodity Broker. The Fund assesses its variation margin requirements on a daily basis by recalculating the change in value of the futures contracts based on price movements. Subsequent cash payments are made or received by the Fund each business day depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred on the futures contracts. Effective February 24, 2015, only the current day s variation margin receivable or payable is disclosed as an asset or liability on the Statement of Financial Condition.   
 The Fund defines cash and cash equivalents to be cash, money market mutual funds and other highly liquid investments, with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. There were no cash equivalents held by the Fund as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
 (h) Income Taxes 
 The Fund is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Fund will generally not incur U.S. federal income taxes. No provision for federal, state, and local income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements, as investors are individually liable for income taxes, if any, on their allocable share of the Fund s income, gain, loss, deductions and other items. 
   The Managing Owner has reviewed all of the Fund s open tax years and major jurisdictions and concluded that there is no tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax returns.  
 14 
 
  The Fund is also not aware of any tax positions for which i  t is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. On an ongoing basis, the Managing Owner will monitor the Fund s tax positions taken under the interpretation (and consult with   its tax counsel from time to time when appropriate) to determine if adjustments to conclusions are necessary based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analysis of tax law, regulation, and interpretations thereof. The major tax jurisdiction   for the Fund and the earliest tax year subject to examination: United States, 2012.  
 (i) Currency Futures Contracts 
 The Fund utilizes derivative instruments to achieve its investment objective. A futures contract is an agreement between counterparties to purchase or sell a specified underlying security or index for a specified price at a future date. All of the Fund s currency futures contracts are held and used for trading purposes. During the period the futures contracts are open, changes in the value of the contracts are recognized as unrealized gains or losses by recalculating the value of the contracts on a daily basis. Subsequent or variation margin payments are received or made depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. These amounts are reflected as a receivable or payable on the Statements of Financial Condition. When the contracts are closed or expire, the Fund recognizes a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the proceeds from, or cost of, the closing transaction and the Fund s basis in the contract. Realized gains (losses) and changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on open positions are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statements of Income and Expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively. 
 The Fair Value of Derivative Instruments is as follows: 

(a)    
 
 Includes cumulative appreciation (depreciation) of currency futures contracts. Only current day s variation margin receivable (payable) is reported in the June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 Statements of Financial Condition.    

 The Effect of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Income and Expenses is as follows: 

The table below summarizes the average monthly notional value of futures contracts outstanding during the period: 

The brokerage agreement with the Commodity Broker provides for the net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default or termination of any one contract. The Managing Owner will utilize any excess cash held at the Commodity Broker to offset any realized losses incurred in the currency futures contracts, if available. To the extent that any excess cash held at the Commodity Broker is not adequate to cover any realized losses, a portion of the United States Treasury Obligations on deposit with the Commodity Broker will be sold to make additional cash available. For financial reporting purposes, the Fund offsets  
 15 
 
  financial assets and financial liabilities   that are subject to netting arrangements. In order for an arrangement to be eligible for netting, the Fund must have a basis to conclude that such netting arrangements are legally enforceable.  
 The following table presents derivative instruments that are either subject to an enforceable netting agreement or offset by collateral arrangements as of June 30, 2016, net by contract: 

The following table presents derivative instruments that are either subject to an enforceable netting agreement or offset by collateral arrangements as of December 31, 2015, net by contract: 

(a)    
 
 As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a portion of the Fund s U.S. Treasury Obligations were required to be deposited as maintenance margin in support of the Fund s futures positions.    

 (j) Brokerage Commissions and Fees 
 The Fund incurs all brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, National Futures Association ( NFA ) fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities by the Commodity Broker. These costs are recorded as Brokerage Commissions and Fees in the Statements of Income and Expenses. The Commodity Broker s brokerage commissions and trading fees are determined on a contract-by-contract basis. On average, total charges paid to the Commodity Broker were less than $6.00 and $6.00 per round-turn trade for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 (k) Routine Operational, Administrative and Other Ordinary Expenses 
 After the Closing Date, the Managing Owner assumed all routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund, including, but not limited to, computer services, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, legal and accounting fees and expenses, tax preparation expenses, filing fees and printing, mailing and duplication costs. Prior to the Closing Date, the Predecessor Managing Owner assumed all routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund. Accordingly, such expenses are not reflected in the Statements of Income and Expenses of the Fund. 
 (l) Non-Recurring Fees and Expenses 
 The Fund pays all non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses (referred to as extraordinary fees and expenses in the Trust Agreement), if any, of itself, as determined by the Managing Owner. Non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses are fees and expenses which are non-recurring and unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities, litigation costs or indemnification or other unanticipated expenses. Such non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses, by their nature, are unpredictable in terms of timing and amount. For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Fund did not incur such expenses. 

16 
 
    (6) Financial Instrument Risk  
 In the normal course of its business, the Fund is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The term  off-balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in a future obligation or loss in excess of the amounts shown on the Statements of Financial Condition. The financial instruments used by the Fund are currency futures, whose values are based upon an underlying asset and generally represent future commitments that have a reasonable possibility of being settled in cash or through physical delivery. The financial instruments are traded on an exchange and are standardized contracts. 
 Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Fund due to market changes, including fluctuations in currency prices. In entering into these futures contracts, there exists a market risk that such futures contracts may be significantly influenced by adverse market conditions, resulting in such futures contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures contracts at the same time, the Fund could experience substantial losses. 
 Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of the Commodity Broker and/or clearinghouse to perform according to the terms of a futures contract. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transactions. The Commodity Broker, when acting as the Fund s futures commission merchant in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Fund all assets of the Fund relating to domestic futures trading and the Commodity Broker is not allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the Commodity Broker. In addition, CFTC regulations also require the Commodity Broker to hold in a secure account assets of the Fund related to foreign futures trading. The Fund s risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and not represented by the futures contract or notional amounts of the instruments. 
 The Fund has not utilized, nor does it expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind, other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business noted above. 

(7) Share Purchases and Redemptions 
 (a) Purchases 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Administrator who serves as the Fund s transfer agent ( Transfer Agent ) to create one or more Baskets. For purposes of processing both creation and redemption orders, a  business day  means any day other than a day when banks in New York City are required or permitted to be closed. Creation orders must be placed by 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Transfer Agent receives a valid creation order is the creation order date. The day on which a creation order is settled is the creation order settlement date. As provided below, the creation order settlement date may occur up to three business days after the creation order date. By placing a creation order, and prior to delivery of such Baskets, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the creation order. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, Baskets are issued on the creation order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the creation order date at the applicable net asset value per Share as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which its futures contracts are traded, whichever is later, on the creation order date, but only if the required payment has been timely received. Upon submission of a creation order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a creation order settlement date up to three business days after the creation order date. 
 Creation orders may be placed either (i) through the Continuous Net Settlement ( CNS ) clearing processes of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the  NSCC ) (the  CNS Clearing Process ) or (ii) if outside the CNS Clearing Process, only through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ( DTC  or the  Depository ) (the  DTC Process ), or a successor depository. 
 (b) Redemptions 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Transfer Agent to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Managing Owner receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. The day on which a redemption order is settled is the redemption order settlement date. As provided below, the redemption order settlement date may occur up to three business days after the redemption order date. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets. Individual Shareholders may not redeem directly from the Fund. Instead, individual Shareholders may only redeem Shares in integral multiples of 200,000 and only through an Authorized Participant. 
 17 
 
    Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Own  er and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, by placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to the Fund not later than the redemption order settle  ment date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. Upon submission of a redemption order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a redemption order settlement date up   to three business days after the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order.  
 Redemption orders may be placed either (i) through the CNS Clearing Process or (ii) if outside the CNS Clearing Process, only through the DTC Process, or a successor depository, and only in exchange for cash. 
 The redemption proceeds from the Fund consist of the cash redemption amount. The cash redemption amount is equal to the net asset value of the number of Basket(s) of the Fund requested in the Authorized Participant s redemption order as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which the Fund s futures contracts are traded, whichever is later, on the redemption order date. The Managing Owner will distribute the cash redemption amount at the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date through DTC to the account of the Authorized Participant as recorded on DTC s book-entry system. 
 The redemption proceeds due from the Fund are delivered to the Authorized Participant at 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date if, by such time, the Fund s DTC account has been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed. If the Fund s DTC account has not been credited with all of the Baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution is delivered to the extent of whole Baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution is delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole Baskets received if the Transfer Agent receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which the Managing Owner may, from time-to-time, determine and the remaining Baskets to be redeemed are credited to the Fund s DTC account by 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order will be cancelled. The Managing Owner is also authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the Baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Fund s DTC account by 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the Baskets through DTC s book-entry system on such terms as the Managing Owner may determine from time-to-time. 

(8) Profit and Loss Allocations and Distributions 
 Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, income and expenses are allocated  pro rata  to the Managing Owner as holder of the General Shares and to the Shareholders monthly based on their respective percentage interests as of the close of the last trading day of the preceding month. Distributions (other than redemption of units) may be made at the sole discretion of the Managing Owner on a  pro rata  basis in accordance with the respective capital balances of the shareholders. 
 No distributions were paid for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
 (9) Commitments and Contingencies 
 The Managing Owner, either in its own capacity or in its capacity as the Managing Owner and on behalf of the Fund, has entered into various service agreements that contain a variety of representations, or provide indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the Fund. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, no claims had been received by the Fund. Further, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts. Accordingly, the Managing Owner expects the risk of loss to be remote.

ITEM  2.   
 
        MANAGEMENT S     DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

These forward-looking statements are based on the registrant s current expectations, estimates and projections about the registrant s business and industry and its beliefs and assumptions about future events. Words such as  anticipate,   expect,   intend,   plan,   believe,   seek,   outlook  and  estimate,  as well as similar words and phrases, signify forward-looking statements. PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund s (the  Fund ) forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions and important factors, risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. 
 You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the Federal securities laws, Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC ( Invesco ), undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or the risks, uncertainties or other factors described in this Report, as a result of new information, future events or changed circumstances or for any other reason after the date of this Report. 
 Overview/Introduction 
     PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund (the  Fund ), a series of PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Trust (the  Trust ), a Delaware statutory trust, establishes short positions in certain futures contracts (the  DX Contracts ) with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index Excess Return (the  Short Index  or the  Index ), over time. The performance of the Fund also is intended to reflect the excess, if any, of its interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) over the expenses of the Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund may hold United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds for margin and/or cash management purposes. 
 The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are traded through the currency markets of ICE Futures U.S. (formerly known as the New York Board of Trade   ), under the symbol  DX.  The changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts are related to the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the U.S. Dollar Index    (the  USDX    ). The Index provides a general indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar relative to the six major world currencies (each an  Index Currency,  and collectively, the  Index Currencies ), which comprise the USDX    Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. 
 As of the date of this Report, each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago (USA) LLC, Virtu Financial BD LLC, Knight Capital Americas LLC, Timber Hill LLC, Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC, Jefferies   Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, UBS Securities LLC, Cantor Fitzgerald   Co., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Goldman, Sachs   Co., Goldman Sachs Execution   Clearing, L.P. and Citadel Securities LLC has executed a Participant Agreement and are the only Authorized Participants. 
                           On February 23, 2015 (the  Closing Date ), Invesco completed the purchase of the assets of DB Commodity Se  rvices LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( DBCS ),   including   all of   its   interests in   the Fund and the sole and exclusive power to direct the business and affairs of the Trust and the Fund, as well as certain other assets of DBCS pertaining to the m  anagement of the Trust and the Fund, pursuant to the terms and conditions of   a certain asset purchase agreement   (the  Transaction ). Invesco now serves as the managing owner (the  Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of t  he Trust and the Fund, in replacement of DBCS (the  Predecessor Managing Owner ). 
 Effective as of the Closing Date, the Managing Owner, on behalf of the Trust and the Fund, has appointed Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to serve as the index sponsor (the  Index Sponsor ). Prior to the Closing Date, the index sponsor was Deutsche Bank AG London. The Index Sponsor calculates and publishes the daily index levels and the indicative intraday index levels. Additionally, the Index Sponsor also calculates the indicative value per Share of the Fund throughout each business day. The Index Sponsor may subcontract its services from time-to-time to one or more third parties. 
 The Shares are designed for investors who want a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in a group of currency futures on U.S. and non-U.S. markets. 
 20 
 
    The USDX        mark is a registered service mark owned by ICE Futures U.S., Inc.  
 As of the date of this Report, the DX Contracts are not subject to speculative position limits. There can be no assurance that the DX Contracts will not become subject to speculative position limits. Should the Fund become subject to speculative position limits with respect to its DX Contracts holdings, the Fund s ability to issue new Baskets or the Fund s ability to reinvest income in additional DX Contracts may be limited to the extent that these activities would cause the Fund to exceed the potential future position limits. Limiting the size of the Fund may affect the correlation between the price of the Shares, as traded on the NYSE Arca, and the net asset value of the Fund. That is, the inability to create additional Baskets could result in Shares trading at a premium or discount to the net asset value of the Fund. 
 If the Managing Owner determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it has become impracticable or inefficient for any reason for the Fund to gain full or partial exposure to the DX Contracts, the Fund may: 

invest in a different month DX Contract other than the specific DX Contract that was originally required by the Index, or     

invest in another futures contract substantially similar to the DX Contracts, if available, or     

invest in the futures contracts referencing the Index Currencies, or     

invest in a forward agreement, swap, or other OTC derivative referencing the Index Currencies,     

 if, in the commercially reasonable judgment of the Managing Owner, such above instruments tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with the DX Contract. 
 The Fund is an index tracking fund and does not utilize any trading system, whether discretionary, systematic or otherwise. The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in DX Contracts. In turn, the Fund seeks to track the Index by establishing short positions in DX Contracts accordingly. Therefore, the Managing Owner serves in an administrative role in order to ensure that the Fund invests in a manner that seeks to track the Index. 
   Under the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agr  eement of the Trust, as amended (the  Trust Agreement ), Wilmington Trust Company, the trustee of the Trust and the Fund (the  Trustee ), has delegated to the Managing Owner the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of the Trust and the Fund. The Trustee will have no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Managing Owner, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Managing Owner. 
 The Shares are intended to provide investment results that generally correspond to the changes, positive or negative, in the levels of the Index over time. The value of the Shares is expected to fluctuate in relation to changes in the value of the Fund s portfolio. The market price of the Shares may not be identical to the net asset value per Share, but these two valuations are expected to be very close. 
 Index Description 
 The Managing Owner pays the Index Sponsor a licensing fee and an index services fee for performing its duties. These fees constitute a portion of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses which are paid out of the Management Fee and are not charged to or reimbursed by the Fund.  
             Neither the Managing Owner nor any affiliate of the Managing Owner has any rights to influence the selection of the futures contracts underlying the Index.   Neither   the Managing Owner, nor, after   the Closing Date, the Fund is   affiliated with the Index Sponsor. The Managing Owner has entered into a license agreement with the Index Sponsor to use the Index.  
 The Fund is not sponsored or endorsed by Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. or any subsidiary or affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG or Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (collectively,  Deutsche Bank ). The Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index Excess Return TM  (the  Index ) is the exclusive property of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.  DBIQ  is a service mark of Deutsche Bank AG and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, concerning the Index, the Fund or the advisability of investing in securities generally. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index has any obligation to take the needs of the Managing Owner or its clients into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the Index. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index is responsible for or has participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at, quantities or valuation of the Fund. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index has any obligation or liability in connection with the administration or trading of the Fund.  
 21 
 
    NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE INDEX, WARRANTS OR GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILIT  Y FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INTERRUPTIONS THEREIN. NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE INDEX, MAKES ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED BY INVESCO POWERSHARES CAPITAL   MANAGEMENT LLC FROM THE USE OF THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN. NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE INDEX, MAKES ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, OF   MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL DEUTSCHE BANK OR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE   INDEX HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY, THERE ARE NO THIRD PARTY BE  NEFICIARIES OF ANY AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN DEUTSCHE BANK AND INVESCO POWERSHARES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC.   
 No purchaser, seller or holder of the Shares of this Fund, or any other person or entity, should use or refer to any Deutsche Bank trade name, trademark or service mark to sponsor, endorse, market or promote this Fund without first contacting Deutsche Bank to determine whether Deutsche Bank s permission is required. Under no circumstances may any person or entity claim any affiliation with Deutsche Bank without the written permission of Deutsche Bank.  
 The Index is designed to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, from investing in the first to expire DX Contracts whose changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, in turn, are tied to the USDX     . The first to expire DX Contracts are the futures contracts that expire in March, June, September and December. DX Contracts are traded exclusively through ICE Futures U.S., under the symbol  DX.   
 The changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of DX Contracts are related to the Index Currencies. (Although the Index tracks the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in the first to expire DX Contracts, the closing level of the Index is in effect, and in part, a reflection of the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of the underlying Index Currencies.) The Index Currencies are Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. The Index Currencies represent the currencies of the major trading partners of the U.S.  
 The USDX    is composed of notional amounts of each Index Currency. The notional amounts of the Index Currencies included in the USDX    reflect a geometric weighted average of the change in the Index Currencies  exchange rates against the U.S. dollar relative to March 1973. March 1973 was chosen as the base period of the USDX    because it represents a significant milestone in foreign exchange history when the world s major trading nations allowed their currencies to float freely against each other. 
 The fair value of DX Contracts is based on foreign exchange futures prices for the underlying Index Currencies. The fair value of DX Contracts is calculated in the same way as a spot index. DX Contracts, similar to single currency futures contracts, will trade at a forward premium or discount based on the interest rate differential between the U.S. dollar and the Index Currencies. 
 Volatility of the USDX    has been historically comparable in range and variability to a broad-based, multi-capitalization stock index future. The DX Contract price is sized at $1,000 times the USDX    closing level. Thus, if the USDX    closing level is 100.00, the DX Contract will be valued $100,000. If the USDX    closing level is 112.50, each DX Contract will have a $112,500 value. 
 The sponsor of the Index is Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (previously defined as the  Index Sponsor ). The Index Sponsor may from time-to-time subcontract the provision of the calculation and other services described below to one or more third parties. 
 USDX       Composition 
 The Index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in the first to expire DX Contracts. In turn, the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of DX Contracts are related to the changes, positive and negative, in the level of the USDX   . 
   The USDX    provides a general indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar and is composed of notional amounts of each of the Index Currencies. The notional amounts of each Index Currency included in the USDX    are weighted to reflect the currencies of the largest trading partners of the U.S. These largest trading partners constitute the bulk of international trade with the United States and have well-developed foreign exchange markets with rates freely determined by market participants. In addition,  
 22 
 
  many currencies not in  cluded in the USDX        move in close correlation with those that are included. The USDX        is computed 24 hours a day, seven days a week based on exchange rates supplied to Reuters by some 500 banks worldwide.  
 The following table reflects the index base weights (the  Index Base Weights ) of each Index Currency as of March 1973 with respect to the USDX   : 

The USDX    has been calculated since inception in March 1973. The closing level at inception was 100.00. 
 The Euro was included in the USDX    in 1999 and replaced the following currencies that were originally included in the USDX   : Belgian Franc, Dutch Guilder, German Mark, French Franc and Italian Lira. 
 Please see  http://www.invescopowershares.com  with respect to the most recently available weighted composition of the Fund and the composition of the Index on the Base Date (as defined below). 
 Index Calculation 
 The Index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in the first to expire DX Contracts relative to the value of the dollar as of December 31, 1986 (the  Base Date ), which expire in March, June, September and December. On the Base Date, the closing level was 100.00. Although the DX Contract started trading in 1985, the Base Date of December 31, 1986 was selected because reasonably reliable pricing data was not available prior to December 31, 1986. A quote of  105.50  means the U.S. dollar s value has risen 5.50% since the Base Date relative to the underlying basket of Index Currencies which comprise the USDX   . 
 The Index Sponsor calculates the closing level of the Index on both an excess return basis and a total return basis. The excess return index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts. The total return is the sum of the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts plus the return of 3-month U.S. Treasury Bills. The closing levels of the Index have been calculated using historic exchange closing price data of the DX Contracts since the Base Date. 
 The use of short positions on DX Contracts in the construction of the Short Index causes the Short Index to rise as a result of any downward price movement in the DX Contracts. In turn, this appreciation in the short DX Contracts reflects the fall of the U.S. dollar relative to the underlying basket of Index Currencies which comprise the USDX   . 
 Between the Base Date and June 30, 2016, the Short Index closing level has ranged on a daily basis from as high as 153.28 on April 22, 2008 to as low as 91.91 on July 5, 2001. Past Index levels are not necessarily indicative of future Index levels. 
 Index Rolls and Rebalancing of the USDX      
 The underlying DX Contracts of the Index are rolled quarterly over three consecutive business days starting on the Wednesday prior to the applicable IMM Date (each an  Index Roll Day ).  IMM Date  means the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December, a traditional settlement date in the International Money Market. 
 DX Contracts are rolled on each Index Roll Day as follows: 

On each Index Roll Day, 1/3 of the DX Contracts that will expire on the next IMM Date is bought back and positions in the DX Contracts that expire on the IMM Date following the next IMM Date are sold short.     

On each Index Roll Day, new notional holdings are calculated for the old DX Contracts leaving the Index as well as the new DX Contracts entering the Index.     

 23 

On all days that are not Index Roll Days, the notional holdings of the DX Contracts in th  e Index remain constant.     

 There are no regularly scheduled adjustments or rebalancing of the USDX   . The USDX    has only been adjusted once, when the Euro was introduced as the common currency for the European Union (EU) bloc of countries. Without any other adjustments, the combination of components and their respective weightings in the USDX    have yielded performance results similar to other commonly used US dollar indexes, whether those index methodologies are based on trade weights or capital flow weights. 
 Margin Calls 
 Like other futures and derivatives traders, the Fund may be subject to margin calls from time-to-time. The term  margin  has a different meaning in the context of futures contracts and other derivatives than it does in the context of securities. In particular,  margin  on a futures position does not constitute a borrowing of money or the collateralization of a loan. The Fund does not borrow money. 
 To establish a position in an exchange-traded futures contract, the Fund makes a deposit of  initial margin.  The amount of initial margin required to be deposited in order to establish a position in an exchange-traded futures contract varies from instrument to instrument depending, generally, on the historical volatility of the futures contract in question. Determination of the amount of the required initial margin deposit in respect of a particular contract is made by the exchange on which the contract is listed. To establish a long position in an over-the-counter instrument, the counterparty may require an analogous deposit of collateral, depending upon the anticipated volatility of the instrument and the creditworthiness of the person seeking to establish the position. The deposit of initial margin provides assurance to futures commission merchants and clearing brokers involved in the settlement process that sufficient resources are likely to be on deposit to enable a client s position to be closed by recourse to the initial margin deposit should the client fail to meet a demand for variation margin, even if changes in the value of the contract in question, which are marked to market from day to day, continue to reflect the contract s historical volatility. Collateral deposited in support of an over-the-counter instrument serves a similar purpose. 
 Once a position has been established on a futures exchange,  variation margin  generally may be credited or assessed at least daily to reflect changes in the value of the position, except in certain instances where midday variation margin calls are made. In contrast to  initial margin,   variation margin  represents a system of marking to market the futures contract s value. Thus, traders in exchange-traded futures contracts are assessed daily in an amount equal to that day s accumulated losses in respect of any open position (or are credited daily with accumulated gains in respect of such position). Collateral may move between the parties to an over-the-counter instrument in a similar manner as gains or losses accumulate in the instrument. As with initial margin, variation margin serves to secure the obligations of the investor under the contract and to protect those involved in the settlement process against the possibility that a client will have insufficient resources to meet its contractual obligations. Collateral deposited in support of an over-the-counter instrument serves a similar purpose. Like initial margin (or an equivalent deposit of collateral), variation margin (or an equivalent deposit of collateral) does not constitute a borrowing of money, is not considered to be part of the contract purchase price and is returned upon the contract s termination unless it is used to cover a loss in the contract position. United States Treasury Obligations are used routinely to collateralize OTC derivative positions, and are deposited routinely as margin to collateralize futures positions. The Fund may liquidate United States Treasury Obligations to meet an initial or variation margin requirement. 
 Performance Summary 
 This Report covers the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the  Three Months Ended June 30, 2016  and the  Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 , respectively) and the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the "Six Months Ended June 30, 2016" and the "Six Months Ended June 30, 2015", respectively). The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC (the  NYSE Alternext )) on February 20, 2007 and, as of November 25, 2008, is listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the  NYSE Arca ). 
   Performance of the Fund and the exchange traded Shares are detailed below in  Results of Operations . The Fund s performance information from inception up to and excluding the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance a  ssociated with the Predecessor Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund since the Closing Date, and the Fund s performance information since the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance associated with the Managing Owner. Past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 The Index provides a general indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar relative to the six major world currencies (the  Index Currencies ) which comprise the USDX    Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. The Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index Total Return (Short Index-TR), consists of the Index plus 3-month United States Treasury Obligations returns. Past Index results are not necessarily indicative of future changes, positive or negative, in the Index closing levels.

      The section  Summary of the Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX       ) Futures Index Total Return and Underlying DX Contrac  t Returns for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  below provides an overview of the changes in the closing levels of the Index by disclosing the change in closing levels of the Index itself and the underlying DX Contracts of the Index. P    lease note also that the Fund s objective is to track the Index (not the Short   Index-TR   )   and the Fund does not attempt to outperform or underperform the Index.  
  Summary of the Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX ) Futures Index Total Return and Underlying DX Contract Returns for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  

If the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds were to exceed the Fund s fees and expenses, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund is expected to outperform the Index and underperform the Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index Total Return (the  Short Index-TR ). The only difference between the Index and the Short Index-TR is that the Index does not include interest income from a hypothetical basket of fixed income securities while the Short Index-TR does include such a component. The difference between the Index and the Short Index-TR is attributable entirely to the hypothetical interest income from this hypothetical basket of fixed income securities. If the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds exceeds the Fund s fees and expenses, then the amount of such excess is expected to be distributed periodically. The market price of the Shares is expected to closely track the Index. The aggregate return on an investment in the Fund over any period is the sum of the capital appreciation or depreciation of the Shares over the period, plus the amount of any distributions during the period. Consequently, the Fund s aggregate return is expected to outperform the Index by the amount of the excess, if any, of its interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings of money market mutual funds over its fees and expenses but, as a result of the Fund s fees and expenses, the aggregate return on the Fund is expected to underperform the Short Index-TR. If the Fund s fees and expenses were to exceed the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund is expected to underperform the Index. 
 Net Asset Value 
 Net asset value means the total assets of the Fund, including, but not limited to, all currency futures contracts, cash and investments less total liabilities of the Fund, each determined on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), consistently applied under the accrual method of accounting. In particular, net asset value includes any unrealized appreciation or depreciation on open currency futures contracts, and any other credit or debit accruing to the Fund but unpaid or not received by the Fund. All open currency futures contracts will be calculated at their then current market value, which will be based upon the settlement price for that particular currency futures contract traded on the applicable primary exchange on the date with respect to which net asset value is being determined. Under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, instances where the settlement price is not available, the Managing Owner may value any asset of the Fund pursuant to such other principles as the Managing Owner deems fair and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with normal industry standards. Interest earned on the Fund s brokerage account is accrued monthly. The amount of any distribution is a liability of the Fund from the day when the distribution is declared until it is paid. 
 Net asset value per Share is the net asset value of the Fund divided by the number of outstanding Shares. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Fund s critical accounting policies are as follows: 
 Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates, and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Fund s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. There were no significant estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements. 
 25 
 
    Currency futures contracts, United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds are recorded on a trade date basis and at fair value in the financial statements, with changes in fair value, if any, reported in the Statements of   Income and Expenses.  
 The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period, is fundamental to the Fund s financial statements. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). 
 United States Treasury Obligations are fair valued using an evaluated quote provided by an independent pricing service. Futures contracts are valued at the final settlement price set by an exchange on which they are principally traded. Investments in open-end and closed-end registered investment companies that do not trade on an exchange are valued at the end of day NAV per share. Investments in open-end and closed-end registered investment companies that trade on an exchange are valued at the last sales price or official closing price as of the close of the customary trading session on the exchange where the security is principally traded. Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification for fair value measurement and disclosure guidance requires a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. See Note 5(c) within the financial statements in Item 1 for further information. 
 When market closing prices are not available, the Managing Owner may value an asset of the Fund pursuant to policies the Managing Owner has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards. 
 Realized gains (losses) from the sale or disposition of securities or derivatives are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statements of Income and Expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the sale or disposition occurs, respectively. 
 Interest income on United States Treasury Obligations is recognized on an accrual basis when earned. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the United States Treasury Obligations. Dividend income (net of withholding tax, if any) is recorded on the ex-dividend date.  
 Market Risk 
 Trading in futures contracts involves the Fund entering into contractual commitments to sell a particular currency at a specified date and price. The market risk associated with the Fund s commitments to purchase currencies is limited to the gross or face amount of the contracts held. 
 The Fund s exposure to market risk is also influenced by a number of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of the Fund s trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of the investors  capital. 
 Credit Risk 
 When the Fund enters into futures contracts, the Fund is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and on most foreign futures exchanges is the clearing house associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearinghouse will meet its obligations to the Fund. 
 The Commodity Broker, when acting as the Fund s futures commission merchant in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Fund all assets of the Fund relating to domestic futures trading and the Commodity Broker is not allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the Commodity Broker. In addition, CFTC regulations also require the Commodity Broker to hold in a secure account assets of the Fund related to foreign futures trading.  
 26 
 
    Liquidity  
   The Fund s entire source of capital is derived from the Fund s offering of Shares to Authorized Participants. The Fund in turn allocates its net assets to currency futures trading. A significant portion of the net asset value is held in United States Treasury Obligations, which may be used as margin for the Fund s trading in currency futures contracts and United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and cash, which may be used for cash management purposes. The percentage that United States Treasury Obligations bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the Fund s currency futures change. A portion of the Fund s United States Treasury Obligations are held for deposit with the Commodity Broker to meet margin requirements. All remaining cash, money market mutual funds and United States Treasury Obligations are on deposit wi  th The Bank of New York Mellon. Interest earned on the Fund s interest-bearing funds and dividends from the Fund s holdings of money market mutual funds are paid to the Fund. 
 The Fund s currency futures contracts may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations or for other reasons. For example, currency futures exchanges may limit fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as  daily limits.  During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a particular futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the futures contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Although the DX Contracts that the Fund invests in are not currently subject to daily limits, the DX Contracts held by the Fund could become subject to such limits in the future. Such market conditions could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating its currency futures positions. 
 Because the Fund trades futures contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of futures contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties (including the Commodity Broker and/or exchange clearinghouses) to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Transfer Agent to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Managing Owner receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. The day on which a redemption order is settled is the redemption order settlement date. As provided below, the redemption order settlement date may occur up to three business days after the redemption order date. Redemption orders are irrevocable. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets. Individual Shareholders may not redeem directly from the Fund. Instead, individual Shareholders may only redeem Shares in integral multiples of 200,000 and only through an Authorized Participant. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, by placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to the Fund not later than the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. Upon submission of a redemption order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a redemption order settlement date up to three business days after the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. 
 Redemption orders may be placed either (i) through the Continuous Net Settlement ( CNS ) clearing processes of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the  NSCC ) (the  CNS Clearing Process ) or (ii) if outside the CNS Clearing Process, only through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ( DTC  or the  Depository ) (the  DTC Process ), or a successor depository, and only in exchange for cash. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order and such fee is not borne by the Fund. 
 Cash Flows 
 The primary cash flow activity of the Fund is to raise capital from Authorized Participants through the issuance of Shares. This cash is used to invest in United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds and to meet margin requirements as a result of the positions taken in DX Contracts to match the fluctuations of the Index the Fund is tracking. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities was $(5.3) million and $2.5 million for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts primarily include net purchases and sales of United States Treasury Obligations which are held at fair value on the Statements of Financial Condition. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its Index. The Fund may hold United States Treasury obligations and money market mutual funds for margin and/or cash management purposes.   
 27 
 
    Du  ring the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016, $79.9 million was paid to purchase United States Treasury Obligations and $73.5 million was received from sales and maturing United States Treasury Obligations. During the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015, $75.0 milli  on was paid to purchase United States Treasury Obligations and $81.0 million was received from sales and maturing United States Treasury Obligations. Unrealized appreciation/depreciation on United States Treasury Obligations and futures increased (decrease  d) Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities by $0.0 million and $(0.8) million during the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Financing Activities 
 The Fund s net cash flow provided by (used for) financing activities was $(0.2) million and $(0.2) million during the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This included $17.3 million and $13.2 million from the sale of Shares to Authorized Participants and $17.5 million and $13.4 million from Shares redeemed by Authorized Participants during the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  Results of Operations  
 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 
           The Fund was launched on February 15, 2007 at $25.00 per Share. The Shares traded on the NYSE Alternext from February 20, 2007 to November 25, 2008 and have been trading on the NYSE Arca since November 25, 2008. The Fund s performance information from ince  ption up to and excluding the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance associated with the Predecessor Managing Owner.   The Managing Owner has served as managing owner of   the Fund since the Closing Date, and the Fund s performance information since t  he Closing Date is a reflection   of the performance associated with the Managing Owner. Past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 The Fund seeks to track changes in the closing levels of the Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index  Excess Return (the  Short Index  or the  Index ), over time, plus the excess, if any, of the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds over the expenses of the Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its Index. The Fund may hold United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds for margin and/or cash management purposes. 
 The following graphs illustrate changes in (i) the price of the Shares (as reflected by the line  Market ), (ii) the Fund s NAV (as reflected by the line  NAV ), and (iii) the closing levels of the Index (as reflected by the line  DB Short US Dollar Index (USDX) Futures Index ER ). Whenever the interest and dividend income earned by the Fund exceeds Fund expenses, the price of the Shares generally has exceeded the levels of the Index primarily because the Share price reflects interest and dividend income from the Fund s collateral holdings whereas the Index does not consider such income. There can be no assurances that the price of the Shares will exceed the Index levels. 
 The Index is a set of rules applied to a body of data and does not represent the results of actual investment or trading. The Index is frictionless, in that it does not take into account fees or expenses associated with investing in the Fund. Also, because it does not represent actual futures positions, the Index is not subject to, and does not take into account the impact of, speculative position limits (if applicable) or certain other similar limitations on the ability of the Fund to trade the DX Contracts. The  TR  version of the Index includes an assumed amount of interest income based on prevailing rates that is adjusted from time to time. The Fund, by contrast, invests actual money and trades actual futures contracts. As a result, the performance of the Fund involves friction, in that fees and expenses impose a drag on performance. The Fund may be subject to speculative position limits (if applicable) and certain other limitations on its ability to trade the DX Contracts, which may compel the Fund to trade futures or other instruments that are not the DX Contracts as proxies for the DX Contracts. The interest rate and dividend income actually earned by the Fund over any period may differ from the assumed amount of interest income factored into the  TR  version of the Index over the same period. All of these factors can contribute to discrepancies between changes in net asset value per Share and changes in the level of the Index over any period of time. The dividends received by the Fund from its holdings in money market mutual funds, if any, is not taken into account when determining the performance of the Index and, therefore, it may also contribute to those discrepancies. The extent to which the Fund has invested at an aggregate notional level approximating the Index value as opposed to the Fund s aggregate net asset value also may contribute to those discrepancies. Fees and expenses always will tend to cause changes in the net asset value per Share to underperform changes in the value of the Index over any given period, all other things being equal. Actual interest income from the Fund s holdings of United States Treasury Obligations could be higher or lower than the assumed interest income factored into the  TR  version of the Index, and together with the dividends could cause changes in the net asset value per Share to outperform or underperform changes in the value of the  TR  version of the Index over any given period, all other things being equal. Similarly, trading futures or other instruments that are not the DX Contracts as proxies for the DX Contracts could cause changes in the net asset value per Share to outperform or underperform changes in the value of the Index over any given period, all other things being equal.

 WHILE THE FUND S OBJECTIVE IS NOT TO GENERATE PROFIT THROUGH ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUT IS TO TRACK THE INDEX, BECAUSE THE INDEX WAS ESTABLISHED IN AUGUST 2006, CERTAIN INFORMATION RELATING TO THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE  HYPOTHETICAL.  HYPOTHETICAL INFORMATION MAY HAVE CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. 
 WITH RESPECT TO INDEX DATA, NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT THE INDEX WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE CLOSING LEVELS CONSISTENT WITH OR SIMILAR TO THOSE SET FORTH HEREIN. SIMILARLY, NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT THE FUND WILL GENERATE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THE FUND S PAST PERFORMANCE OR THE HISTORICAL ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY INVESTMENT METHODOLOGIES, WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. 
 WITH RESPECT TO INDEX DATA, ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL INFORMATION IS THAT IT IS GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. TO THE EXTENT THAT INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN RELATES TO THE PERIOD DECEMBER 1986 THROUGH JULY 2006, THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS REFLECT THE APPLICATION OF THE INDEX S METHODOLOGY, AND SELECTION OF DX CONTRACTS, IN HINDSIGHT.  
 NO HYPOTHETICAL RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  SET FORTH IN THE FUND S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, RELATED TO THE CURRENCIES MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUND S EFFORTS TO TRACK THE INDEX OVER TIME WHICH CANNOT BE, AND HAVE NOT BEEN, ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF THE INDEX INFORMATION SET FORTH ON THE FOLLOWING PAGES, ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS FOR THE FUND. FURTHERMORE, THE INDEX INFORMATION DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK OR ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FUND.  
 THE MANAGING OWNER AND ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE MANAGING THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS FOR THE FUND AND HAVE ONLY MANAGED AN EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND THAT RELATES TO A BROAD-BASED COMMODITY INDEX FOR A SHORT PERIOD. BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITED ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF THE MANAGING OWNER THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS SET FORTH HEREIN, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY WARY OF PLACING UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE INDEX RESULTS. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NONE OF THE PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE MANAGING OWNER.  
 THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER, AN INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF DEUTSCHE BANK AG, COMMENCED OPERATIONS IN JANUARY 2006. AS THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER, THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER AND ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS MANAGED THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS FOR THE FUND FROM INCEPTION UP TO AND EXCLUDING THE CLOSING DATE. BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITED ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS TO COMPARE TO THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS SET FORTH HEREIN, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY WARY OF PLACING UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE INDEX RESULTS. IN RESPECT OF ANY PERIOD, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NONE OF THE PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION AFTER THE CLOSING DATE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER.  
 THE FUND S PERFORMANCE INFORMATION FROM INCEPTION UP TO AND EXCLUDING THE CLOSING DATE IS A REFLECTION OF THE PERFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER . THE MANAGING OWNER HAS SERVED AS MANAGING OWNER OF THE FUND SINCE THE CLOSING DATE, AND THE FUND S PERFORMANCE INFORMATION SINCE THE CLOSING DATE IS A REFLECTION OF THE PERFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANAGING OWNER. PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  
 In the normal course of its business, the Fund is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The term  off-balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in a future obligation or loss. The financial instruments used by the Fund are currency futures, whose values are based upon an underlying asset and generally represent future commitments which have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash or through physical delivery. The financial instruments are traded on an exchange and are standardized contracts. 
 The Fund has not utilized, nor does it expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind, other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business noted above, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interest of the Fund. While the Fund s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Fund s financial position. The Managing Owner expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
   The Fund s contractual obligations are with the Managing Owner and the Commodity Broker. Management Fee payments made to the Managing Owner are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Fund s net asset value. Commission payme  nts to the Commodity Broker are on a contract-by-contract, or round-turn, basis. As such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as net asset values and trading activity are not known until a future date. These agreements are effective for one-year terms, renewable automatically for additional one-year terms unless terminated. Additionally, these agreements may be terminated by either party for various reasons. For the avoidance of doubt, from inception up to and excluding the Closing Date, all Management Fees were paid to the Predecessor Managing Owner. Since the Closing Date, the Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund and all Management Fee accruals since the Closing Date have been paid to the Managing Owner. 

ITEM 3.    
 
     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

 INTRODUCTION 
 The Fund is designed to replicate positions in a currency futures index. The market sensitive instruments held by it are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Fund s main line of business. 
 Market movements can produce frequent changes in the fair market value of the Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Fund s market risk is primarily influenced by changes in the prices of currencies. 
 Value at Risk, or VaR, is a measure of the maximum amount which the Fund could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty in the markets in which the Fund trades and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated VaR or the Fund s experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of this, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification included in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to VaR or by the Fund s attempts to manage its market risk. 
 Standard of Materiality 
 Materiality as used in this section,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and the potential losses caused by such movements, taking into account the effects of margin, and any other multiplier features, as applicable, of the Fund s market sensitive instruments. 
 QUANTIFYING THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements 
 The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures contain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ) and Section 21E of the Exchange Act). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact (such as the dollar amount of maintenance margin required for market risk sensitive instruments held at the end of the reporting period). 
 33 
 
    Value at risk (VaR), is a statistical measure of the value of losses that would not be expected to be exceeded over a given time ho  rizon and at a given probability level arising from movement of underlying risk factors. Loss is measured as a decline in the fair value of the portfolio as a result of changes in any of the material variables by which fair values are determined. VaR is me  asured over a specified holding period (one day) and to a specified level of statistical confidence (99th percentile). However, the inherent uncertainty in the markets in which the Fund trades and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund of market   movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated VaR or the Fund s experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of this, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future   projections, the inclusion of the quantification included in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to VaR or by the Fund s attempts to manage its mar  ket risk.  
 THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 The Fund calculates VaR using the actual historical market movements of the Fund s net assets. 
 The following table indicates the trading VaR associated with the Fund s net assets as of June 30, 2016. 

The following table indicates the trading VaR associated with the Fund s net assets as of December 31, 2015. 

*   
 
 The VaR represents the one day downside risk, under normal market conditions, with a 99% confidence level. It is calculated using historical market moves of the Fund s net assets and uses a one year look back.    

 NON-TRADING RISK 
 The Fund has non-trading market risk as a result of investing in short-term United States Treasury Obligations. As such, the market risk represented by these investments is expected to be immaterial. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING PRIMARY TRADING RISK EXPOSURES 
 The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures except for those disclosures that are statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The Fund s primary market risk exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund s current market exposure will not change materially. Investors may lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Fund. 
 Several factors may affect the price of the Index Currencies (which underlie the DX Contracts), including, but not limited to: 

National debt levels and trade deficits, including changes in balances of payments and trade;     

Domestic and foreign inflation rates and investors  expectations concerning inflation rates;     

Domestic and foreign interest rates and investors  expectations concerning interest rates;     

 34 

Currency exchange rates;     

Investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and currency funds;     

Global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations;     

Supply and demand changes which influence the foreign exchange rates of various currencies;     

Monetary policies of governments (including exchange control programs, restrictions on local exchanges or markets and limitations on foreign investment in a country or on investment by residents of a country in other countries), trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;     

Governmental intervention in the currency market, directly and by regulation, in order to influence currency prices; and     

Expectations among market participants that a currency s value soon will change.     

 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-TRADING RISK EXPOSURE 
 General 
 The Fund is unaware of any (i) anticipated known demands, commitments or capital expenditures; (ii) material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in its capital resources; or (iii) trends or uncertainties that will have a material effect on operations. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING MEANS OF MANAGING RISK EXPOSURE 
 Under ordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s discretionary power is limited to determining whether the Fund will make a distribution. Under emergency or extraordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s discretionary powers increase, but remain circumscribed. These special circumstances, for example, include the unavailability of the Index or certain natural or man-made disasters. The Managing Owner does not actively manage the Fund to avoid losses. The Fund initiates positions only on the  short  side of the market and does not employ  stop-loss  techniques. 

ITEM  4.   
 
     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

 For purposes of this Item 4, all references to the  Fund  shall be read to specifically include the Fund and the Trust. Please note that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of the Trust are the aggregate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of the Fund and that of PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund, each a series of the Trust. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the management of the Managing Owner, including Daniel Draper, its Principal Executive Officer and President, and Steven Hill, its Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, Investment Pools, the Fund carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, and, based upon that evaluation, Daniel Draper, the Principal Executive Officer and President, and Steven Hill, the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, Investment Pools, of the Managing Owner, concluded that the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information the Fund is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management of the Managing Owner, including its Principal Executive Officer and President and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, Investment Pools, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
     There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Fund s quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.

Item  1.   
 
     Legal Proceedings.    

 Not applicable. 

Item  1A.   
 
     Risk Factors.    

 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP informed the Fund that it has identified an issue related to its independence under Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (referred to as the Loan Rule). The Loan Rule prohibits accounting firms, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, from being deemed independent if they have certain financial relationships with their audit clients or certain affiliates of those clients. The Fund is required under various securities laws to have its financial statements audited by an independent accounting firm. 
   
 The Loan Rule specifically provides that an accounting firm would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of an audit client s equity securities. For purposes of the Loan Rule, audit clients include the Fund as well as all registered investment companies advised by the Managing Owner and its affiliates, including other subsidiaries of the Managing Owner s parent company, Invesco Ltd. (collectively, the Invesco Fund Complex). PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP informed the Fund it has relationships with lenders who hold, as record owner, more than ten percent of the shares of certain funds within the Invesco Fund Complex. These relationships call into question PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP independence under the Loan Rule with respect to those funds, as well as all other funds in the Invesco Fund Complex. 
   
 On June 20, 2016, the SEC Staff issued a  no-action  letter to another mutual fund complex (see Fidelity Management   Research Company et al., No-Action Letter) related to the audit independence issue described above. In that letter, the SEC confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against a fund that relied on audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the Loan Rule in certain specified circumstances.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP   confirmed that the circumstances which called into question its independence under the Loan Rule with respect to the audits of the Invesco Fund Complex are substantially similar to circumstances described in the no action letter.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has concluded that its objectivity and impartiality was not impaired and that they have complied with PCAOB Rule 3526(b)(1) and (2).  Therefore, the   Managing Owner  , the Fund and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have concluded that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP can continue as the Fund s independent registered public accounting firm.  The Invesco Fund Complex intends to rely upon the no-action letter.  
   
 If in the future the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is called into question under the Loan Rule by circumstances that are not addressed in the SEC s no-action letter, the Fund will need to take other action in order for the Fund s filings with the SEC containing financial statements to be deemed compliant with applicable securities laws. Such additional actions could result in additional costs, impair the ability of the Fund to issue new shares or have other material adverse effects on the Fund. In addition, the SEC has indicated that the no-action relief will expire 18 months from its issuance, after which the Invesco Fund Complex will no longer be able to rely on the letter unless it s term is extended or made permanent by the SEC Staff. 

Item  2.   
 
     Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.    

 (a) There have been no unregistered sales of the Fund s securities. No Fund securities are authorized for issuance by the Fund under equity compensation plans.

         Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements 
 June 30, 2016 

(1) Background 
 On October 24, 2014, DB Commodity Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( DBCS ), DB U.S. Financial Markets Holding Corporation ( DBUSH ) and Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC ( Invesco ) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Agreement ). DBCS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DBUSH. DBCS agreed to transfer and sell to Invesco all of DBCS  interests in PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Trust (the  Trust ), a Delaware statutory trust, and the Trust s two separate series, one of which is PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (the  Fund ), including the sole and exclusive power to direct the business and affairs of the Trust and the Fund, as well as certain other assets pertaining to the management of the Trust and the Fund, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement (the  Transaction ). 
 The Transaction was consummated on February 23, 2015 (the  Closing Date ). Invesco now serves as the managing owner (the  Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund, in replacement of DBCS (the  Predecessor Managing Owner ). 

(2) Organization 
 The Fund, a separate series of the Trust, is a Delaware statutory trust organized in two separate series, was formed on August 3, 2006. The Predecessor Managing Owner seeded the Fund with a capital contribution of $1,000 in exchange for 40 General Shares of the Fund. The General Shares were sold to the Managing Owner by the Predecessor Managing Owner pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the  Trust Agreement ). The Fund has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. 
 The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the  Shares ) only to certain eligible financial institutions (the  Authorized Participants ) in one or more blocks of 200,000 Shares, called a Basket. The Fund commenced investment operations on February 15, 2007. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC (the  NYSE Alternext )) on February 20, 2007 and, as of November 25, 2008, is listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the  NYSE Arca ). 
 This Quarterly Report (the  Report ) covers the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the  Three Months Ended June 30, 2016  and the  Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 , respectively) and the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015(hereinafter referred to as the "Six Months Ended June 30, 2016" and the "Six Months Ended June 30, 2015", respectively). The Fund s performance information from inception up to and excluding the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance associated with the Predecessor Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund since the Closing Date, and the Fund s performance information since the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance associated with the Managing Owner. Past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future performance. 
 The accompanying unaudited financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim period financial statements have been made. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full-year period. These financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Fund s financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. 

(3) Fund Investment Overview 
 The Fund establishes long positions in certain futures contracts (the  DX Contracts ), with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index (USDX ) Futures Index Excess Return (the  Long Index  or the  Index ), over time. The performance of the Fund also is intended to reflect the excess, if any, of its interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) over the expenses of the Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund may hold United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) for margin and/or cash management purposes. 
    The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are traded through the currency markets of ICE Futures U.S. (formerly known as the New York Board of  
 10 

Tr  ade ), under the symbol  DX.  The changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts are related to the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the U.S. Dollar Index  (the  USDX  ). The Index provides a gene  ral indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar relative to the six major world currencies (each an  Index Currency,  and collectively, the  Index Currencies ), which comprise the USDX  Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedi  sh Krona and Swiss Franc.  
   
 (4) Service Providers and Related Party Agreements

The Commodity Broker is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG and is an affiliate of the Predecessor Managing Owner. A variety of executing brokers execute futures transactions on behalf of the Fund. Such executing brokers give-up all such transactions to the Commodity Broker.

The Administrator maintains certain financial books and records, including: Basket creation and redemption books and records, fund accounting records, ledgers with respect to assets, liabilities, capital, income and expenses, the registrar, transfer journals and related details, and trading and related documents received from the Commodity Broker. The Managing Owner pays the Administrator fees for its services out of the Management Fee. 
 11 

As of December 31, 2014, the Fund held $18,108,522 of c  ash and $1,006,974,568 of United States Treasury Obligations at the Commodity Broker. In conjunction with the Transaction, during the three-day period from February 24, 2015 to February 26, 2015, the Fund transferred $55,000,000 of cash and $1,074,986,895   of United States Treasury Obligations from the Commodity Broker to the Custodian. The Fund s open positions of currency futures contracts remained with the Commodity Broker and accordingly, $55,249,567 of futures variation margin was credited to the Commod  ity Broker. $32,000,000 of United States Treasury Obligations also remained with the Commodity Broker to satisfy maintenance margin requirements. Effective February 26, 2015, the Managing Owner began transferring cash daily from the Custodian to the Commod  ity Broker to satisfy the previous day s variation margin on open futures contracts.

(5) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 (a) Basis of Presentation 
 The financial statements of the Fund have been prepared using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ).  
 The Fund has determined that it meets the definition of an investment company and has prepared the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP for investment companies in conformity with accounting and reporting guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946  Investment Companies . 
 (b) Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
 12 

(c) Financial Instruments and Fair Value  
 Investment transactions are recorded in the Statements of Financial Condition on a trade date basis at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in each period. U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. 
 U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods, giving the highest priority to readily available unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), generally when market prices are not readily available or are unreliable. Based on the valuation inputs, the securities or other investments are tiered into one of three levels. Changes in valuation methods or market conditions may result in transfers in or out of an investment s assigned level: 

Level 1:   
 
 Prices are determined using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets.    

Level 2:   
 
 Prices are determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants may use in pricing a security. These may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, yield curves, loss severities, default rates, discount rates, volatilities and others.    

Level 3:   
 
 Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable (for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period), unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Fund s own assumptions about the factors market participants would use in determining fair value of the securities or instruments and would be based on the best available information.    

 United States Treasury Obligations are fair valued using an evaluated quote provided by an independent pricing service. Evaluated quotes provided by the pricing service may be determined without exclusive reliance on quoted prices, and may reflect appropriate factors such as developments related to specific securities, yield, quality, type of issue, coupon rate, maturity, individual trading characteristics and other market data. All debt obligations involve some risk of default with respect to interest and/or principal payments. 
 Currency futures contracts are valued at the final settlement price set by an exchange on which they are principally traded. 
 Investments in open-end and closed-end registered investment companies that do not trade on an exchange are valued at the end of day NAV per share. Investments in open-end and closed-end registered investment companies that trade on an exchange are valued at the last sales price or official closing price as of the close of the customary trading session on the exchange where the security is principally traded. 
 When market closing prices are not available, the Managing Owner may value an asset of the Fund pursuant to policies the Managing Owner has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards. 
 The levels assigned to the securities valuations may not be an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with investing in those securities. Because of the inherent uncertainties of valuation, the values reflected in the financial statements may materially differ from the value received upon actual sale of those investments. 
 The following is a summary of the tiered valuation input levels as of June 30, 2016: 

(a)    
 
 Unrealized appreciation (depreciation).    

 The following is a summary of the tiered valuation input levels as of December 31, 2015:

 13 

(d) Deposits with Commodity   Broker     and Custodian  
 The Fund deposits cash and United States Treasury Obligations with its Commodity Broker subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the  CFTC ) regulations and various exchange and broker requirements. The combination of the Fund s deposits with its Commodity Broker of cash and United States Treasury Obligations and the unrealized profit or loss on open futures contracts represents the Fund s overall equity in its broker trading account. To meet the Fund s maintenance margin requirements, the Fund holds United States Treasury Obligations. The Fund transfers cash to the Commodity Broker to satisfy variation margin requirements. The Fund earns interest on any excess cash deposited with the Commodity Broker and incurs interest expense on any deficit balance with the Commodity Broker. 
 The Fund s remaining cash, United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual fund holdings are on deposit with its Custodian. 
 (e) Investment Transactions and Investment Income 
 Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains (losses) from the sale or disposition of securities or derivatives are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statements of Income and Expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the sale or disposition occurs, respectively.  
 Interest income on United States Treasury Obligations is recognized on an accrual basis when earned. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the United States Treasury Obligations. Dividend income (net of withholding tax, if any) is recorded on the ex-dividend date. 
 (f) Receivable/(Payable) for Shares Issued and Redeemed 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order to create or redeem Shares of the Fund. Cash settlement occurs at the creation order settlement date or the redemption order settlement date as discussed in Note 7. 
 (g) Cash Held by Commodity Broker 
 The Fund s arrangement with the Commodity Broker requires the Fund to meet its variation margin requirement related to the price movements on futures contracts held by the Fund by maintaining cash on deposit with the Commodity Broker. The Fund assesses its variation margin requirements on a daily basis by recalculating the change in value of the futures contracts based on price movements. Subsequent cash payments are made or received by the Fund each business day depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred on the futures contracts. Effective February 24, 2015, only the current day s Variation Margin receivable or payable is disclosed as an asset or liability on the Statement of Financial Condition. 
 The Fund defines cash and cash equivalents to be cash, money market mutual funds and other highly liquid investments, with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. There were no cash equivalents held by the Fund as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
 (h) Income Taxes 
 The Fund is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Fund will generally not incur U.S. federal income taxes. No provision for federal, state, and local income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements, as investors are individually liable for income taxes, if any, on their allocable share of the Fund s income, gain, loss, deductions and other items. 
 The Managing Owner has reviewed all of the Fund s open tax years and major jurisdictions and concluded that there is no tax liability resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in future tax returns. The Fund is also not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. On an ongoing basis, the Managing Owner will monitor the Fund s tax positions taken under the interpretation (and consult with its tax counsel from time to time when appropriate) to determine if adjustments to conclusions are necessary based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analysis of tax law, regulation, and interpretations thereof. The major tax jurisdiction for the Fund and the earliest tax year subject to examination: United States, 2012. 
 (i) Currency Futures Contracts 
   The Fund utilizes derivative instruments to achieve its investment objective. A futures contract is an agreement between counterparties to purchase or sell a specified underlying security or index for a specified price at a future date. All of the Fund s  
 14 

currency futures contracts are held and used for trading purposes.   During the period the futures contracts are open, changes in the value of the contracts are recognized as unrealized     gains or losses by recalculating the value of the contracts on a daily b  asis. Subsequent or variation margin payments are received or     made depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. These amounts are reflected as a receivable or payable on the     Statements of Financial Condition. When the contracts are close  d or expire, the Fund recognizes a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the proceeds from, or cost of, the closing transaction and the Fund s basis in the contract.   Realized gains (losses) and changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciati  on) on open positions are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statements of Income and Expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively.  
 The Fair Value of Derivative Instruments is as follows: 

(a)    
 
 Includes cumulative appreciation (depreciation) of currency futures contracts. Only current day s variation margin receivable (payable) is reported in the June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 Statements of Financial Condition.    

 The Effect of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Income and Expenses is as follows: 

The table below summarizes the average monthly notional value of futures contracts outstanding during the period: 

15 

The brokerage agreement with the Commodity Broker provides for the net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default or termination of any one   contract. The Managing Owner will utilize any excess cash held at the Commodity Broker to offset any realized losses incurred in the currency futures contracts, if available. To the extent that any excess cash held at the Commodity Broker is not adequate t  o cover any realized losses, a portion of the United States Treasury Obligations on deposit with the Commodity Broker will be sold to make additional cash available. For financial reporting purposes, the Fund offsets financial assets and financial liabilit  ies that are subject to netting arrangements. In order for an arrangement to be eligible for netting, the Fund must have a basis to conclude that such netting arrangements are legally enforceable.  
   
  The following table presents derivative instruments that are either subject to an enforceable netting agreement or offset by collateral arrangements as of June 30, 2016, net by contract: 

16 

The following table presents derivative instruments that are either subject to an enforceable netting agreement or   offset by collateral arrangements as of December 31, 2015, net by contract:  

(a)    
 
 As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a portion of the Fund s U.S. Treasury Obligations were required to be deposited as maintenance margin in support of the Fund s futures positions.     

 (j) Brokerage Commissions and Fees 
 The Fund incurs all brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, National Futures Association ( NFA ) fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities by the Commodity Broker. These costs are recorded as Brokerage Commissions and Fees in the Statements of Income and Expenses. The Commodity Broker s brokerage commissions and trading fees are determined on a contract-by-contract basis. On average, total charges paid to the Commodity Broker were less than $6.00 and $6.00 per round-turn trade during the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 (k) Routine Operational, Administrative and Other Ordinary Expenses 
 After the Closing Date, the Managing Owner assumed all routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund, including, but not limited to, computer services, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, legal and accounting fees and expenses, tax preparation expenses, filing fees and printing, mailing and duplication costs. Prior to the Closing Date, the Predecessor Managing Owner assumed all routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Fund. Accordingly, such expenses are not reflected in the Statements of Income and Expenses of the Fund. 
 (l) Non-Recurring Fees and Expenses 
 The Fund pays all non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses (referred to as extraordinary fees and expenses in the Trust Agreement), if any, of itself, as determined by the Managing Owner. Non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses are fees and expenses which are non-recurring and unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities, litigation costs or indemnification or other unanticipated expenses. Such non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses, by their nature, are unpredictable in terms of timing and amount.      For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016   and 2015, the Fund did not incur such expenses. 

(6) Financial Instrument Risk 
 In the normal course of its business, the Fund is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The term  off-balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in a future obligation or loss in excess of the amounts shown on the Statements of Financial Condition. The financial instruments used by the Fund are currency futures, whose values are based upon an underlying asset and generally represent future commitments that have a reasonable possibility of being settled in cash or through physical delivery. The financial instruments are traded on an exchange and are standardized contracts. 
 Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Fund due to market changes, including fluctuations in currency prices. In entering into these futures contracts, there exists a market risk that such futures contracts may be significantly influenced by adverse market conditions, resulting in such futures contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures contracts at the same time, the Fund could experience substantial losses. 
   Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of the Commodity Broker and/or clearinghouse to perform according to the terms of a futures contract. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transactions. The Commodity Broker, when acting as the Fund s futures commission merchant in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Fund all assets of the Fund relating to domestic futures trading  
 17 

and the Commodity Broker is not allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the Commodity Broker. In addition, CFTC regulations also require the Commodity Broker to hold in a secure account assets of the Fund related to foreign futur  es trading. The Fund s risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and not represented by the futures contract or notional amounts of the instruments.  
 The Fund has not utilized, nor does it expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind, other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business noted above. 

(7) Share Purchases and Redemptions 
 (a) Purchases 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Administrator who serves as the Fund s transfer agent ( Transfer Agent ) to create one or more Baskets. For purposes of processing both creation and redemption orders, a  business day  means any day other than a day when banks in New York City are required or permitted to be closed. Creation orders must be placed by 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Transfer Agent receives a valid creation order is the creation order date. The day on which a creation order is settled is the creation order settlement date. As provided below, the creation order settlement date may occur up to three business days after the creation order date. By placing a creation order, and prior to delivery of such Baskets, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the creation order. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, Baskets are issued on the creation order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the creation order date at the applicable net asset value per Share as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which its futures contracts are traded, whichever is later, on the creation order date, but only if the required payment has been timely received. Upon submission of a creation order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a creation order settlement date up to three business days after the creation order date. 
 Creation orders may be placed either (i) through the Continuous Net Settlement ( CNS ) clearing processes of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the  NSCC ) (the  CNS Clearing Process ) or (ii) if outside the CNS Clearing Process, only through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ( DTC  or the  Depository ) (the  DTC Process ), or a successor depository. 
 (b) Redemptions 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Transfer Agent to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Managing Owner receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. The day on which a redemption order is settled is the redemption order settlement date. As provided below, the redemption order settlement date may occur up to three business days after the redemption order date. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets. Individual Shareholders may not redeem directly from the Fund. Instead, individual Shareholders may only redeem Shares in integral multiples of 200,000 and only through an Authorized Participant. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, by placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to the Fund not later than the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. Upon submission of a redemption order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a redemption order settlement date up to three business days after the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. 
 Redemption orders may be placed either (i) through the CNS Clearing Process or (ii) if outside the CNS Clearing Process, only through the DTC Process, or a successor depository, and only in exchange for cash. 
 The redemption proceeds from the Fund consist of the cash redemption amount. The cash redemption amount is equal to the net asset value of the number of Basket(s) of the Fund requested in the Authorized Participant s redemption order as of the closing time of the NYSE Arca or the last to close of the exchanges on which the Fund s futures contracts are traded, whichever is later, on the redemption order date. The Managing Owner will distribute the cash redemption amount at the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date through DTC to the account of the Authorized Participant as recorded on DTC s book-entry system. 
 18 

The r  edemption proceeds due from the Fund are delivered to the Authorized Participant at 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date if, by such time, the Fund s DTC account has been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed. If the Fund s D  TC account has not been credited with all of the Baskets to be redeemed by such time, the redemption distribution is delivered to the extent of whole Baskets received. Any remainder of the redemption distribution is delivered on the next business day to th  e extent of remaining whole Baskets received if the Transfer Agent receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which the Managing Owner may, from time-to-time, determine     and the remaining Baskets to be redeemed are cred  ited to the Fund s DTC account by 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on such next business day. Any further outstanding amount of the redemption order will be cancelled. The Managing Owner is also authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding tha  t the Baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Fund s DTC account by 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the redemption order settlement date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized its obligation to deliver the Baskets through DTC s book-entry syst  em on such terms as the Managing Owner may determine from time-to-time.

 Overview/Introduction 
 PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (the  Fund ), a series of PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Trust (the  Trust ), a Delaware statutory trust, establishes long positions in certain futures contracts (the  DX Contracts ) with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index Excess Return, the  Long Index  or the  Index , over time. The performance of the Fund also is intended to reflect the excess, if any, of its interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds (affiliated or otherwise) over the expenses of the Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund may hold United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds for margin and/or cash management purposes. 
 The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are traded through the currency markets of ICE Futures U.S. (formerly known as the New York Board of Trade   ), under the symbol  DX.  The changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts are related to the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the U.S. Dollar Index    (the  USDX    ). The Index provides a general indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar relative to the six major world currencies (each an  Index Currency,  and collectively, the  Index Currencies ) which comprise the USDX    Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. 
 As of the date of this Report, each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago (USA) LLC, Virtu Financial BD LLC, Knight Capital Americas LLC, Timber Hill LLC, Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC, Jefferies   Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, UBS Securities LLC, Cantor Fitzgerald   Co., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Goldman, Sachs   Co., Goldman Sachs Execution   Clearing, L.P. and Citadel Securities LLC has executed a Participant Agreement and are the only Authorized Participants. 
 On February 23, 2015 (the  Closing Date ), Invesco completed the purchase of the assets of DB Commodity Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( DBCS ), including all of its interests in the Fund and the sole and exclusive power to direct the business and affairs of the Trust and the Fund, as well as certain other assets of DBCS pertaining to the management of the Trust and the Fund, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a certain asset purchase agreement (the  Transaction ). Invesco now serves as the managing owner (the  Managing Owner ), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund, in replacement of DBCS (the  Predecessor Managing Owner ). 
 Effective as of the Closing Date, the Managing Owner, on behalf of the Trust and the Fund, has appointed Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to serve as the index sponsor (the  Index Sponsor ). Prior to the Closing Date, the index sponsor was Deutsche Bank AG London. The Index Sponsor calculates and publishes the daily index levels and the indicative intraday index levels. Additionally, the Index Sponsor also calculates the indicative value per Share of the Fund throughout each business day. The Index Sponsor may subcontract its services from time-to-time to one or more third parties. 
 The Shares are designed for investors who want a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in a group of currency futures on U.S. and non-U.S. markets. 
 21 

The USDX        mark is a registered service mark owned by ICE Futures U.S., Inc.  
 As of the date of this Report, the DX Contracts are not subject to speculative position limits. There can be no assurance that the DX Contracts will not become subject to speculative position limits. Should the Fund become subject to speculative position limits with respect to its DX Contracts holdings, the Fund s ability to issue new Baskets or the Fund s ability to reinvest income in additional DX Contracts may be limited to the extent that these activities would cause the Fund to exceed the potential future position limits. Limiting the size of the Fund may affect the correlation between the price of the Shares, as traded on the NYSE Arca, and the net asset value of the Fund. That is, the inability to create additional Baskets could result in Shares trading at a premium or discount to the net asset value of the Fund. 
 If the Managing Owner determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it has become impracticable or inefficient for any reason for the Fund to gain full or partial exposure to the DX Contracts, the Fund may: 

invest in a different month DX Contract other than the specific DX Contract that was originally required by the Index, or     

invest in another futures contract substantially similar to the DX Contracts, if available, or     

invest in the futures contracts referencing the Index Currencies, or     

invest in a forward agreement, swap, or other OTC derivative referencing the Index Currencies,     

 if, in the commercially reasonable judgment of the Managing Owner, such above instruments tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with the DX Contract. 
 The Fund is an index tracking fund and does not utilize any trading system, whether discretionary, systematic or otherwise. The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in DX Contracts. In turn, the Fund seeks to track the Index by establishing long positions in DX Contracts accordingly. Therefore, the Managing Owner serves in an administrative role in order to ensure that the Fund invests in a manner that seeks to track the Index.  
 Under the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, as amended (the  Trust Agreement ), Wilmington Trust Company, the trustee of the Trust and the Fund (the  Trustee ), has delegated to the Managing Owner the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of the Trust and the Fund. The Trustee will have no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Managing Owner, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Managing Owner. 
 The Shares are intended to provide investment results that generally correspond to the changes, positive or negative, in the levels of the Index over time. The value of the Shares is expected to fluctuate in relation to changes in the value of the Fund s portfolio. The market price of the Shares may not be identical to the net asset value per Share, but these two valuations are expected to be very close. 
 Index Description 
 The Managing Owner pays the Index Sponsor a licensing fee and an index services fee for performing its duties. These fees constitute a portion of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses which are paid out of the Management Fee and are not charged to or reimbursed by the Fund. 
 Neither the Managing Owner nor any affiliate of the Managing Owner has any rights to influence the selection of the futures contracts underlying the Index. Neither the Managing Owner, nor, after the Closing Date, the Fund is affiliated with the Index Sponsor. The Managing Owner has entered into a license agreement with the Index Sponsor to use the Index. 
 The Fund is not sponsored or endorsed by Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. or any subsidiary or affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG or Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (collectively,  Deutsche Bank ). The Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index (USDX ) Futures Index   Excess Return TM  (the  Index ) is the exclusive property of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.   DBIQ  is a service mark of Deutsche Bank AG and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.  Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, concerning the Index, the Fund or the advisability of investing in securities generally. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index has any obligation to take the needs of the Managing Owner or its clients into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the Index. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index is responsible for or has participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at, quantities or valuation of the Fund. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Index has any obligation or liability in connection with the administration or trading of the Fund.  
 22 

NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE INDEX, WARRANTS OR GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS, OM  ISSIONS, OR INTERRUPTIONS THEREIN. NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE INDEX, MAKES ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED BY INVESCO POWERSHARES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC FROM   THE USE OF THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN. NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE INDEX, MAKES ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, OF MERCHANTABILITY OR F  ITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL DEUTSCHE BANK OR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE INDEX HAVE ANY LIAB  ILITY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY, THERE ARE NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF ANY A  GREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN DEUTSCHE BANK AND INVESCO POWERSHARES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC.  
 No purchaser, seller or holder of the Shares of this Fund, or any other person or entity, should use or refer to any Deutsche Bank trade name, trademark or service mark to sponsor, endorse, market or promote this Fund without first contacting Deutsche Bank to determine whether Deutsche Bank s permission is required. Under no circumstances may any person or entity claim any affiliation with Deutsche Bank without the written permission of Deutsche Bank. 
 The Index is designed to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, from investing in the first to expire DX Contracts whose changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, in turn, are tied to the USDX   . The first to expire DX Contracts are the futures contracts that expire in March, June, September and December. DX Contracts are traded exclusively through ICE Futures U.S., under the symbol  DX.  
 The changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of DX Contracts are related to the Index Currencies. (Although the Index tracks the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in the first to expire DX Contracts, the closing level of the Index is in effect, and in part, a reflection of the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of the underlying Index Currencies.) The Index Currencies are Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. The Index Currencies represent the currencies of the major trading partners of the U.S. 
 The USDX    is composed of notional amounts of each Index Currency. The notional amounts of the Index Currencies included in the USDX    reflect a geometric weighted average of the change in the Index Currencies  exchange rates against the U.S. dollar relative to March 1973. March 1973 was chosen as the base period of the USDX    because it represents a significant milestone in foreign exchange history when the world s major trading nations allowed their currencies to float freely against each other. 
 The fair value of DX Contracts is based on foreign exchange futures prices for the underlying Index Currencies. The fair value of DX Contracts is calculated in the same way as a spot index. DX Contracts, similar to single currency futures contracts, will trade at a forward premium or discount based on the interest rate differential between the U.S. dollar and the Index Currencies. 
 Volatility of the USDX    has been historically comparable in range and variability to a broad-based, multi-capitalization stock index future. The DX Contract price is sized at $1,000 times the USDX    closing level. Thus, if the USDX    closing level is 100.00, the DX Contract will be valued $100,000. If the USDX    closing level is 112.50, each DX Contract will have a $112,500 value. 
 The sponsor of the Index is Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (previously defined as the  Index Sponsor ). The Index Sponsor may from time-to-time subcontract the provision of the calculation and other services described below to one or more third parties. 
 USDX    Composition 
 The Index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in the first to expire DX Contracts. In turn, the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of DX Contracts are related to the changes, positive and negative, in the level of the USDX   . 
   The USDX    provides a general indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar and is composed of notional amounts of each of the Index Currencies. The notional amounts of each Index Currency included in the USDX    are weighted to reflect the currencies of the largest trading partners of the U.S. These largest trading partners constitute the bulk of international trade with the United States and have well-developed foreign exchange markets with rates freely determined by market participants. In addition,  
 23 

many currencies not included in the USDX        move in close correlation with those that are included. The USDX        is computed 24 hours a day, seven days a week based on exchange rates supplied to Reuters by s  ome 500 banks worldwide.  
 The following table reflects the index base weights (the  Index Base Weights ) of each Index Currency as of March 1973 with respect to the USDX   : 

The USDX    has been calculated since inception in March 1973. The closing level at inception was 100.00. 
 The Euro was included in the USDX    in 1999 and replaced the following currencies that were originally included in the USDX   : Belgian Franc, Dutch Guilder, German Mark, French Franc and Italian Lira. 
 Please see  http://www.invescopowershares.com  with respect to the most recently available weighted composition of the Fund and the composition of the Index on the Base  Date (as defined below) . 
 Index Calculation 
 The Index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of long positions in the first to expire DX Contracts relative to the value of the dollar as of December 31, 1986 (the  Base Date ), which expire in March, June, September and December. On the Base Date, the closing level was 100.00. Although the DX Contract started trading in 1985, the Base Date of December 31, 1986 was selected because reasonably reliable pricing data was not available prior to December 31, 1986. A quote of  105.50  means the U.S. dollar s value has risen 5.50% since the Base Date relative to the underlying basket of Index Currencies which comprise the USDX   . 
 The Index Sponsor calculates the closing level of the Index on both an excess return basis and a total return basis. The excess return index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts. The total return is the sum of the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts plus the return of 3-month U.S. Treasury Bills. The closing levels of the Index have been calculated using historic exchange closing price data of the DX Contracts since the Base Date. 
 The use of long positions on DX Contracts in the construction of the Long Index causes the Long Index to rise as a result of any upward price movement in the DX Contracts. In turn, this appreciation in the long DX Contracts reflects the rise of the U.S. dollar relative to the underlying basket of Index Currencies which comprise the USDX   . 
 Between the Base Date and June 30, 2016, the Long Index closing level has ranged on a daily basis from as high as 100.58 on January 5, 1987 to as low as 51.94 on April 29, 2011. Past Index levels are not necessarily indicative of future Index levels. 
 Index Rolls and Rebalancing of the USDX    
 The underlying DX Contracts of the Index are rolled quarterly over three consecutive business days starting on the Wednesday prior to the applicable IMM Date (each an  Index Roll Day ).  IMM Date  means the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December, a traditional settlement date in the International Money Market. 
 24 

DX Contracts are rolled on each Index Roll Day as follows:  

On each Index Roll Day, 1/3 of the DX Contracts that will expire on the next IMM Date are sold and positions in the DX Contracts that expire on the IMM Date following the next IMM Date are purchased.     

On each Index Roll Day, new notional holdings are calculated for the old DX Contracts leaving the Index as well as the new DX Contracts entering the Index.     

On all days that are not Index Roll Days, the notional holdings of the DX Contracts in the Index remain constant.     

 There are no regularly scheduled adjustments or rebalancings of the USDX   . The USDX    has only been adjusted once, when the Euro was introduced as the common currency for the European Union (EU) bloc of countries. Without any other adjustments, the combination of components and their respective weightings in the USDX    have yielded performance results similar to other commonly used US dollar indexes, whether those index methodologies are based on trade weights or capital flow weights. 
 Margin Calls 
 Like other futures and derivatives traders, the Fund may be subject to margin calls from time-to-time. The term  margin  has a different meaning in the context of futures contracts and other derivatives than it does in the context of securities. In particular,  margin  on a futures position does not constitute a borrowing of money or the collateralization of a loan. The Fund does not borrow money. 
 To establish a position in an exchange-traded futures contract, the Fund makes a deposit of  initial margin.  The amount of initial margin required to be deposited in order to establish a position in an exchange-traded futures contract varies from instrument to instrument depending, generally, on the historical volatility of the futures contract in question. Determination of the amount of the required initial margin deposit in respect of a particular contract is made by the exchange on which the contract is listed. To establish a long position in an over-the-counter instrument, the counterparty may require an analogous deposit of collateral, depending upon the anticipated volatility of the instrument and the creditworthiness of the person seeking to establish the position. The deposit of initial margin provides assurance to futures commission merchants and clearing brokers involved in the settlement process that sufficient resources are likely to be on deposit to enable a client s position to be closed by recourse to the initial margin deposit should the client fail to meet a demand for variation margin, even if changes in the value of the contract in question, which are marked to market from day to day, continue to reflect the contract s historical volatility. Collateral deposited in support of an over-the-counter instrument serves a similar purpose. 
 Once a position has been established on a futures exchange,  variation margin  generally may be credited or assessed at least daily to reflect changes in the value of the position, except in certain instances where midday variation margin calls are made. In contrast to  initial margin,   variation margin  represents a system of marking to market the futures contract s value. Thus, traders in    exchange-traded futures contracts are assessed daily in an amount equal to that day s accumulated losses in respect of any open position (or are credited daily with accumulated gains in respect of such position). Collateral may move between the parties to an over-the-counter instrument in a similar manner as gains or losses accumulate in the instrument. As with initial margin, variation margin serves to secure the obligations of the investor under the contract and to protect those involved in the settlement process against the possibility that a client will have insufficient resources to meet its contractual obligations. Collateral deposited in support of an over-the-counter instrument serves a similar purpose. Like initial margin (or an equivalent deposit of collateral), variation margin (or an equivalent deposit of collateral) does not constitute a borrowing of money, is not considered to be part of the contract purchase price and is returned upon the contract s termination unless it is used to cover a loss in the contract position. United States Treasury Obligations are used routinely to collateralize OTC derivative positions, and are deposited routinely as margin to collateralize futures positions. The Fund may liquidate United States Treasury Obligations to meet an initial or variation margin requirement. 
 Performance Summary 
 This Report covers the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the  Three Months Ended June 30, 2016  and the  Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 , respectively) and the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015(hereinafter referred to as the "Six Months Ended June 30, 2016" and the "Six Months Ended June 30, 2015", respectively) 
  The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC (the  NYSE Alternext )) on February 20, 2007 and, as of November 25, 2008, is listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the  NYSE Arca ). 
   Performance of the Fund and the exchange traded Shares are detailed below in  Results of Operations . The Fund s performance information from inception up to and excluding the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance associated with the  
 25 

Predecessor Managing Owner.   The Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund since the Closing Date, and the Fund s performance information since the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance   associated with the Managing Owner.   Past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future performance.  
 The Index provides a general indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar relative to the six major world currencies (the  Index Currencies ), which comprise the USDX    Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. The Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index Total Return (Long Index-TR), consists of the Index plus 3- month United States Treasury Obligations returns. Past Index results are not necessarily indicative of future changes, positive or negative, in the Index closing levels. 
 The section  Summary of the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index Total Return and Underlying DX Contract Returns for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  below provides an overview of the changes in the closing levels of the Index by disclosing the change in closing levels of the Index itself and the underlying DX Contracts of the Index. Please note also that the Fund s objective is to track the Index (not the Long Index-TR ) and the Fund does not attempt to outperform or underperform the Index. 
  Summary of the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index Total Return and Underlying DX Contract Returns for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  

If the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds were to exceed the Fund s fees and expenses, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund is expected to outperform the Index and underperform the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index (USDX ) Futures Index Total Return (the  Long Index-TR ). The only difference between the Index and the Long Index-TR is that the Index does not include interest income from a hypothetical basket of fixed income securities while the Long Index-TR does include such a component. The difference between the Index and the Long Index-TR is attributable entirely to the hypothetical interest income from this hypothetical basket of fixed income securities. If the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds exceeds the Fund s fees and expenses, then the amount of such excess is expected to be distributed periodically. The market price of the Shares is expected to closely track the Index. The aggregate return on an investment in the Fund over any period is the sum of the capital appreciation or depreciation of the Shares over the period, plus the amount of any distributions during the period. Consequently, the Fund s aggregate return is expected to outperform the Index by the amount of the excess, if any, of its interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds over its fees and expenses but, as a result of the Fund s fees and expenses, the aggregate return on the Fund is expected to underperform the Long Index-TR. If the Fund s fees and expenses were to exceed the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds, the aggregate return on an investment in the Fund is expected to underperform the Index.  
 Net Asset Value 
 Net asset value means the total assets of the Fund, including, but not limited to, all currency futures contracts, cash and investments less total liabilities of the Fund, each determined on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), consistently applied under the accrual method of accounting. In particular, net asset value includes any unrealized appreciation or depreciation on open currency futures contracts, and any other credit or debit accruing to the Fund but unpaid or not received by the Fund. All open currency futures contracts will be calculated at their then current market value, which will be based upon the settlement price for that particular currency futures contract traded on the applicable primary exchange on the date with respect to which net asset value is being determined. Under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, instances where the settlement price is not available, the Managing Owner may value any asset of the Fund pursuant to such other principles as the Managing Owner deems fair and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with normal industry standards. Interest earned on the Fund s brokerage account is accrued monthly. The amount of any distribution is a liability of the Fund from the day when the distribution is declared until it is paid. 
 Net asset value per Share is the net asset value of the Fund divided by the number of outstanding Shares. 
 26 

Critical Accounting Policies  
 The Fund s critical accounting policies are as follows: 
 Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates, and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the financial statements and accompanying notes. The Fund s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. There were no significant estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements. 
 Currency futures contracts, United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds are recorded on a trade date basis and at fair value in the financial statements, with changes in fair value, if any, reported in the Statements of Income and Expenses. 
 The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period, is fundamental to the Fund s financial statements. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). 
 United States Treasury Obligations are fair valued using an evaluated quote provided by an independent pricing service. Futures contracts are valued at the final settlement price set by an exchange on which they are principally traded. Investments in open-end and closed-end registered investment companies that do not trade on an exchange are valued at the end of day NAV per share. Investments in open-end and closed-end registered investment companies that trade on an exchange are valued at the last sales price or official closing price as of the close of the customary trading session on the exchange where the security is principally traded. Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification for fair value measurement and disclosure guidance requires a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. See Note 5(c) within the financial statements in Item 1 for further information. 
 When market closing prices are not available, the Managing Owner may value an asset of the Fund pursuant to policies the Managing Owner has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards. 
 Realized gains (losses) from the sale or disposition of securities or derivatives are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statements of Income and Expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the sale or disposition occurs, respectively. 
 Interest income on United States Treasury Obligations is recognized on an accrual basis when earned. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the United States Treasury Obligations. Dividend income (net of withholding tax, if any) is recorded on the ex-dividend date. 
 Market Risk 
 Trading in futures contracts involves the Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase a particular currency at a specified date and price. The market risk associated with the Fund s commitments to purchase currencies is limited to the gross or face amount of the contracts held. 
 The Fund s exposure to market risk is also influenced by a number of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of the Fund s trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of the investors  capital. 
 Credit Risk 
   When the Fund enters into futures contracts, the Fund is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and on most foreign futures exchanges is the clearing

house associated with the particul  ar exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cas  es where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearinghouse w  ill meet its obligations to the Fund.  
 The Commodity Broker, when acting as the Fund s futures commission merchant in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Fund all assets of the Fund relating to domestic futures trading and the Commodity Broker is not allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the Commodity Broker. In addition, CFTC regulations also require the Commodity Broker to hold in a secure account assets of the Fund related to foreign futures trading.  
 Liquidity 
 The Fund s entire source of capital is derived from the Fund s offering of Shares to Authorized Participants. The Fund in turn allocates its net assets to currency futures trading. A significant portion of the net asset value is held in United States Treasury Obligations which may be used as margin for the Fund s trading in currency futures contracts and United States Treasury Obligations, money market mutual funds and cash, which may be used for cash management purposes. The percentage that United States Treasury Obligations bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of the Fund s currency futures change. A portion of the Fund s United States Treasury Obligations are held for deposit with the Commodity Broker to meet margin requirements. All remaining cash, money market mutual funds and United States Treasury Obligations are on deposit with The Bank of New York Mellon. Interest earned on the Fund s interest-bearing funds and dividends from the Fund s holdings of money market mutual funds are paid to the Fund. 
 The Fund s currency futures contracts may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations or for other reasons. For example, currency futures exchanges may limit fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as  daily limits.  During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a particular futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the futures contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Although the DX Contracts that the Fund invests in are not currently subject to daily limits, the DX Contracts held by the Fund could become subject to such limits in the future. Such market conditions could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating its currency futures positions. 
 Because the Fund trades futures contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of futures contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties (including the Commodity Broker and/or exchange clearinghouses) to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). 
 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Transfer Agent to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed by 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The day on which the Managing Owner receives a valid redemption order is the redemption order date. The day on which a redemption order is settled is the redemption order settlement date. As provided below, the redemption order settlement date may occur up to three business days after the redemption order date. Redemption orders are irrevocable. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets. Individual Shareholders may not redeem directly from the Fund. Instead, individual Shareholders may only redeem Shares in integral multiples of 200,000 and only through an Authorized Participant. 
 Unless otherwise agreed to by the Managing Owner and the Authorized Participant as provided in the next sentence, by placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book-entry system to the Fund not later than the redemption order settlement date as of 2:45 p.m., Eastern Time, on the business day immediately following the redemption order date. Upon submission of a redemption order, the Authorized Participant may request the Managing Owner to agree to a redemption order settlement date up to three business days after the redemption order date. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. 
 Redemption orders may be placed either (i) through the Continuous Net Settlement ( CNS ) clearing processes of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the  NSCC ) (the  CNS Clearing Process ) or (ii) if outside the CNS Clearing Process, only through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company ( DTC  or the  Depository ) (the  DTC Process ), or a successor depository, and only in exchange for cash. By placing a redemption order, and prior to receipt of the redemption proceeds, an Authorized Participant s DTC account is charged the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order and such fee is not borne by the Fund.

Cash Flows  
 The primary cash flow activity of the Fund is to raise capital from Authorized Participants through the issuance of Shares. This cash is used to invest in United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds and to meet margin requirements as a result of the positions taken in DX Contracts to match the fluctuations of the Index the Fund is tracking. 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities was $265.3 million and $(151.8) million for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts primarily include net income (loss) and net purchases and sales of United States Treasury Obligations which are held at fair value on the Statements of Financial Condition. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track Index. The Fund may hold United States Treasury obligations and money market mutual funds for margin and/or cash management purposes. 
 During the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 $1,492.0 million was paid to purchase United States Treasury Obligations and $1,781.0 million was received from sales and maturing United States Treasury Obligations. During the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015, $2,148.9 million was paid to purchase United States Treasury Obligations and $1,948.0 million was received from sales and maturing United States Treasury Obligations. Unrealized appreciation/depreciation on United States Treasury Obligations and futures increased (decreased) net cash provided by (used for) operating activities by $ (0.0) million and $14.1 million during the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Financing Activities 
 The Fund s net cash flow provided by (used for) financing activities was $(273.7) million and $284.2 million during the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This included $280.1 million and $1,155.4 million from the sale of Shares to Authorized Participants and $553.8 million and $871.2 million from Shares redeemed by Authorized Participants during the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  Results of Operations  
 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 
 The Fund was launched on February 15, 2007 at $25.00 per Share. The Shares traded on the NYSE Alternext from February 20, 2007 to November 25, 2008 and have been trading on the NYSE Arca since November 25, 2008. The Fund s performance information from inception up to and excluding the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance associated with the Predecessor Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund since the Closing Date, and the Fund s performance information since the Closing Date is a reflection of the performance associated with the Managing Owner. Past performance of the Fund is not necessarily indicative of future performance.  
 The Fund seeks to track changes in the closing levels of the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index (USDX   ) Futures Index  Excess Return (the  Long Index  or the  Index ), over time, plus the excess, if any, of the Fund s interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations and dividends from its holdings in money market mutual funds over the expenses of the Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its Index. The Fund may hold United States Treasury Obligations and money market mutual funds for margin and/or cash management purposes. 
 The following graphs illustrate changes in (i) the price of the Shares (as reflected by the line  Market ), (ii) the Fund s NAV (as reflected by the line  NAV ), and (iii) the closing levels of the Index (as reflected by the line  DB Long US Dollar Index (USDX) Futures Index ER ). Whenever the interest and dividend income earned by the Fund exceeds Fund expenses, the price of the Shares generally has exceeded the levels of the Index primarily because the Share price reflects interest and dividend income from the Fund s collateral holdings whereas the Index does not consider such income. There can be no assurances that the price of the Shares will exceed the Index levels. 
   The Index is a set of rules applied to a body of data and does not represent the results of actual investment or trading. The Index is frictionless, in that it does not take into account fees or expenses associated with investing in the Fund. Also, because it does not represent actual futures positions, the Index is not subject to, and does not take into account the impact of, speculative position limits (if applicable) or certain other similar limitations on the ability of the Fund to trade the DX Contracts. The  TR  version of the Index includes an assumed amount of interest income based on prevailing rates that is adjusted from time to time. The Fund, by contrast, invests actual money and trades actual futures contracts. As a result, the performance of the Fund involves friction, in that fees and expenses impose a drag on performance. The Fund may be subject to speculative position limits (if applicable) and certain other limitations on its ability to trade the DX Contracts, which may compel the Fund to trade futures or other instruments that are not the  
 29 

DX Contracts as proxies for the DX Contracts. The interest ra  te   and dividend income   actually earned by the Fund over any period may differ from the assumed amount of interest income factored into the  TR  version of the Index over the same period. All of these factors can contribute to discrepancies between changes   in net asset value per Share and changes in the level of the Index over any period of time.   The dividends received by the Fund from its holdings in money market mutual funds, if any, is not taken into account when determining the performance of the Index a  nd, therefore, it may also contribute to those discrepancies.   The extent to which the Fund has invested at an aggregate notional level approximating the Index value as opposed to the Fund s aggregate net asset value also may contribute to those discrepanci  es. Fees and expenses always will tend to cause changes in the net asset value per Share to underperform changes in the value of the Index over any given period, all other things being equal. Actual interest income   from the Fund s holdings of United States   Treasury Obligations   could be higher or lower than the assumed interest income factored into the  TR  version of the Index, and t  ogether with the dividends   could cause changes in the net asset value per Share to outperform or underperform changes in the v  alue of the  TR  version of the Index over any given period, all other things being equal. Similarly, trading futures or other instruments that are not the DX Contracts as proxies for the DX Contracts could cause changes in the net asset value per Share to   outperform or underperform changes in the value of the Index over any given period, all other things being equal.

 WHILE THE FUND S OBJECTIVE IS NOT TO GENERATE PROFIT THROUGH ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUT IS TO TRACK THE INDEX., BECAUSE THE INDEX WAS ESTABLISHED IN AUGUST 2006, CERTAIN INFORMATION RELATING TO THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE  HYPOTHETICAL.  HYPOTHETICAL INFORMATION MAY HAVE CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. 
 WITH RESPECT TO INDEX DATA, NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT THE INDEX WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE CLOSING LEVELS CONSISTENT WITH OR SIMILAR TO THOSE SET FORTH HEREIN. SIMILARLY, NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT THE FUND WILL GENERATE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THE FUND S PAST PERFORMANCE OR THE HISTORICAL ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY INVESTMENT METHODOLOGIES, WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. 
 WITH RESPECT TO INDEX DATA, ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL INFORMATION IS THAT IT IS GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. TO THE EXTENT THAT INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN RELATES TO THE PERIOD DECEMBER 1986 THROUGH JULY 2006, THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS REFLECT THE APPLICATION OF THE INDEX S METHODOLOGY, AND SELECTION OF DX CONTRACTS, IN HINDSIGHT. 
 NO HYPOTHETICAL RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS FACTORS, [INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  SET FORTH IN THE FUND S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, RELATED TO THE CURRENCIES MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUND S EFFORTS TO TRACK THE INDEX OVER TIME WHICH CANNOT BE, AND HAVE NOT BEEN, ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF THE INDEX INFORMATION SET FORTH ON THE FOLLOWING PAGES, ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS FOR THE FUND. FURTHERMORE, THE INDEX INFORMATION DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK OR ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FUND. 
 THE MANAGING OWNER AND ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS HAVE LIMITED EXPERIENCE MANAGING THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS FOR THE FUND AND HAVE ONLY MANAGED AN EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND THAT RELATES TO A BROAD-BASED COMMODITY INDEX FOR A SHORT PERIOD. BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITED ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF THE MANAGING OWNER THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS SET FORTH HEREIN, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY WARY OF PLACING UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE INDEX RESULTS. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NONE OF THE PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE MANAGING OWNER. 
 THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER, AN INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF DEUTSCHE BANK AG, COMMENCED OPERATIONS IN JANUARY 2006. AS THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER, THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER AND ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS MANAGED THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS FOR THE FUND FROM INCEPTION UP TO AND EXCLUDING THE CLOSING DATE. BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITED ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS TO COMPARE TO THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS SET FORTH HEREIN, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY WARY OF PLACING UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE INDEX RESULTS IN RESPECT OF ANY PERIOD. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NONE OF THE PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION AFTER THE CLOSING DATE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER. 
 THE FUND S PERFORMANCE INFORMATION FROM INCEPTION UP TO AND EXCLUDING THE CLOSING DATE IS A REFLECTION OF THE PERFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREDECESSOR MANAGING OWNER. THE MANAGING OWNER HAS SERVED AS MANAGING OWNER OF THE FUND SINCE THE CLOSING DATE, AND THE FUND S PERFORMANCE INFORMATION SINCE THE CLOSING DATE IS A REFLECTION OF THE PERFORMANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANAGING OWNER. PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

 34 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  
 In the normal course of its business, the Fund is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. The term  off- balance sheet risk  refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in a future obligation or loss. The financial instruments used by the Fund are currency futures, whose values are based upon an underlying asset and generally represent future commitments which have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash or through physical delivery. The financial instruments are traded on an exchange and are standardized contracts. 
 The Fund has not utilized, nor does it expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind, other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business noted above, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interest of the Fund. While the Fund s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Fund s financial position. The Managing Owner expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
 The Fund s contractual obligations are with the Managing Owner and the Commodity Broker. Management Fee payments made to the Managing Owner are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Fund s net asset value. Commission payments to the Commodity Broker are on a contract-by-contract, or round-turn, basis. As such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as net asset values and trading activity are not known until a future date. These agreements are effective for one-year terms, renewable automatically for additional one-year terms unless terminated. Additionally, these agreements may be terminated by either party for various reasons. For the avoidance of doubt, from inception up to and excluding the Closing Date, all Management Fees were paid to the Predecessor Managing Owner. Since the Closing Date, the Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund and all Management Fee accruals since the Closing Date have been paid to the Managing Owner. 

ITEM 3.   
 
     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

 INTRODUCTION 
 The Fund is designed to replicate positions in a currency futures index. The market sensitive instruments held by it are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Fund s main line of business. 
 Market movements can produce frequent changes in the fair market value of the Fund s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Fund s market risk is primarily influenced by changes in the prices of currencies. 
 Value at Risk, or VaR, is a measure of the maximum amount which the Fund could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty in the markets in which the Fund trades and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated VaR or the Fund s experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of this, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification included in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to VaR or by the Fund s attempts to manage its market risk. 
 Standard of Materiality 
 Materiality as used in this section,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and the potential losses caused by such movements, taking into account the effects of margin, and any other multiplier features, as applicable, of the Fund s market sensitive instruments. 
 QUANTIFYING THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements 
 The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures contain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ) and Section 21E of the Exchange Act). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact (such as the dollar amount of maintenance margin required for market risk sensitive instruments held at the end of the reporting period). 
 35 

Value at risk (VaR  ), is a statistical measure of the value of losses that would not be expected to be exceeded over a given time horizon and at a given probability level arising from movement of underlying risk factors. Loss is measured as a decline in the fair value of the   portfolio as a result of changes in any of the material variables by which fair values are determined. VaR is measured over a specified holding period (one day) and to a specified level of statistical confidence (99th percentile). However, the inherent un  certainty in the markets in which the Fund trades and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated VaR or the Fund s experience   to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of this, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification included in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representati  on that the Fund s losses in any market sector will be limited to VaR or by the Fund s attempts to manage its market risk.  
 THE FUND S TRADING VALUE AT RISK 
 The Fund calculates VaR using the actual historical market movements of the Fund s net assets. 
 The following table indicates the trading VaR associated with the Fund s net assets as of June 30, 2016. 

The following table indicates the trading VaR associated with the Fund s net assets as of December 31, 2015. 

*   
 
 The VaR represents the one day downside risk, under normal market conditions, with a 99% confidence level. It is calculated using historical market moves of the Fund s net assets and uses a one year look back.    

 NON-TRADING RISK 
 The Fund has non-trading market risk as a result of investing in short-term United States Treasury Obligations. The market risk represented by these investments is expected to be immaterial. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING PRIMARY TRADING RISK EXPOSURES 
 The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures except for those disclosures that are statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The Fund s primary market risk exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund s current market exposure will not change materially. Investors may lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Fund. 
 Several factors may affect the price of the Index Currencies (which underlie the DX Contracts), including, but not limited to: 

National debt levels and trade deficits, including changes in balances of payments and trade;     

Domestic and foreign inflation rates and investors  expectations concerning inflation rates;     

Domestic and foreign interest rates and investors  expectations concerning interest rates;     

Currency exchange rates;     

Investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and currency funds;     

Global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations;     

 36 

Supply and demand changes which influence the foreign exchange rates of various currencies;     

Monetary policies of governments (including exchange control programs, restrictions on local exchanges or markets and limitations on foreign investment in a country or on investment by residents of a country in other countries), trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;     

Governmental intervention in the currency market, directly and by regulation, in order to influence currency prices; and     

Expectations among market participants that a currency s value soon will change.     

 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-TRADING RISK EXPOSURE 
 General 
 The Fund is unaware of any (i) anticipated known demands, commitments or capital expenditures; (ii) material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in its capital resources; or (iii) trends or uncertainties that will have a material effect on operations. 
 QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING MEANS OF MANAGING RISK EXPOSURE 
 Under ordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s discretionary power is limited to determining whether the Fund will make a distribution. Under emergency or extraordinary circumstances, the Managing Owner s discretionary powers increase, but remain circumscribed. These special circumstances, for example, include the unavailability of the Index or certain natural or man-made disasters. The Managing Owner does not actively manage the Fund to avoid losses. The Fund initiates positions only on the  long  side of the market and does not employ  stop-loss  techniques. 

ITEM     4.   
 
         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

   For purposes of this Item 4, all references to the  Fund  shall be read to specifically include the Fund and the Trust. Please note that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of the Trust are the aggregate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of the Fund and that of PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund, each a series of the Trust. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the management of the Managing Owner, including Daniel Draper, its Principal Executive Officer and President, and Steven Hill, its Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, Investment Pools, the Fund carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, and, based upon that evaluation, Daniel Draper, the Principal Executive Officer and President, and Steven Hill, the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, Investment Pools, of the Managing Owner concluded that the Fund s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information the Fund is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Fund in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management of the Managing Owner, including its Principal Executive Officer and President and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, Investment Pools, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in the Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Fund s quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Fund s internal control over financial reporting.

Item   1A.   
 
            Ris  k Factors.        

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ( ) informed the Fund that it has identified an issue related to its independence under Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (referred to as the Loan Rule). The Loan Rule prohibits accounting firms, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, from being deemed independent if they have certain financial relationships with their audit clients or certain affiliates of those clients. The Fund is required under various securities laws to have its financial statements audited by an independent accounting firm. 
   
 The Loan Rule specifically provides that an accounting firm would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of an audit client s equity securities. For purposes of the Loan Rule, audit clients include the Fund as well as all registered investment companies advised by the Managing Owner and its affiliates, including other subsidiaries of the Managing Owner s parent company, Invesco Ltd. (collectively, the Invesco Fund Complex). PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP informed the Fund it has relationships with lenders who hold, as record owner, more than ten percent of the shares of certain funds within the Invesco Fund Complex. These relationships call into question PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  s independence under the Loan Rule with respect to those funds, as well as all other funds in the Invesco Fund Complex. 
   
 On June 20, 2016, the SEC Staff issued a  no-action  letter to another mutual fund complex (see Fidelity Management   Research Company et al., No-Action Letter) related to the audit independence issue described above. In that letter, the SEC confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against a fund that relied on audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the Loan Rule in certain specified circumstances. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP confirmed that the circumstances which called into question its independence under the Loan Rule with respect to the audits of the Invesco Fund Complex are substantially similar to circumstances described in the no action letter.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has concluded that its objectivity and impartiality was not impaired and that they have complied with PCAOB Rule 3526(b)(1) and (2).  Therefore, the Managing Owner, the Fund and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have concluded that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP can continue as the Fund s independent registered public accounting firm.  The Invesco Fund Complex intends to rely upon the no-action letter  
   
 If in the future the independence of PwC is called into question under the Loan Rule by circumstances that are not addressed in the SEC s no-action letter, the Fund will need to take other action in order for the Fund s filings with the SEC containing financial statements to be deemed compliant with applicable securities laws. Such additional actions could result in additional costs, impair the ability of the Fund to issue new shares or have other material adverse effects on the Fund. In addition, the SEC has indicated that the no-action relief will expire 18 months from its issuance, after which the Invesco Fund Complex will no longer be able to rely on the letter unless it s term is extended or made permanent by the SEC Staff. 

Item   2.   
 
         Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.    

 (a) There have been no unregistered sales of the Fund s securities. No Fund securities are authorized for issuance by the Fund under equity compensation plans.
