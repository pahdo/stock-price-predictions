NOTE

Organization   

DirectView
Holdings, Inc., (the  Company ), was incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 2, 2006. On July 6, 2012 the
Company changed its domicile from Delaware and incorporated in the State of Nevada.  

The
Company has the following four subsidiaries: DirectView Video Technologies Inc., DirectView Security Systems Inc., Ralston Communication
Services Inc., and Meeting Technologies Inc.  

The
Company is a full-service provider of teleconferencing services to businesses and organizations. The Company s conferencing
services enable its clients to cost-effectively conduct remote meetings by linking participants in geographically dispersed
locations. The Company s primary focus is to provide high value-added conferencing services to organizations such as
professional service firms, investment banks, high tech companies, law firms, investor relations firms, and other domestic
and multinational companies. The Company is also a provider of the latest technologies in surveillance systems, digital video
recording and services. The systems provide onsite and remote video and audio surveillance.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, three wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a subsidiary
with which the Company has a majority voting interest of approximately 58% (the other 42% is owned by non-controlling interests,
including 23% which is owned by the Company s CEO who is a majority shareholder of the Parent Company) as of September 30,
2016. In the preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company, intercompany transactions and balances
are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the net earnings of subsidiaries applicable to non-controlling interests.  

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q
and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes
included herein should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December
31, 2015 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016.  

In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items) necessary to present fairly the Company s
financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ending September
30, 2016 have been included. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year.  

Use
of Estimates   

In
preparing the unaudited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses
for the six months then ended. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management
include, but are not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, valuation of stock-based
compensation, the useful life of property and equipment, valuation of beneficial conversion features on convertible debt and the
assumptions used to calculate derivative liabilities.

Non-controlling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements   

The
Company follows ASC 810-10-65,  Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.  This statement clarifies
that a non-controlling (minority) interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the entity that should be reported as equity
in the unaudited consolidated financial statements. It also requires consolidated net income to include the amounts attributable
to both the parent and non-controlling interest, with disclosure on the face of the consolidated income statement of the amounts
attributed to the parent and to the non-controlling interest. In accordance with ASC 810-10-45-21, the losses attributable to
the parent and the non-controlling interest in subsidiary may exceed their interests in the subsidiary s equity. The excess
and any further losses attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest shall be attributed to those interests even
if that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance. As of September 30, 2016, the Company reflected a non-controlling
interest of $28,807 in connection with our majority-owned subsidiary, DirectView Security Systems Inc. as reflected in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company places its cash with a high credit quality financial institution. The Company s account at this institution
is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 the Company has not reached bank balances exceeding the FDIC insurance limit. To reduce its risk associated with the
failure of such financial institution, the Company evaluates at least annually the rating of the financial institution in which
it holds deposits.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company follows FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ), for assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing
generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:  

Level 1:  
      Observable
    inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   

Level 2:  
      Observable
    market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data   

Level 3:  
      Unobservable
    inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions   

Cash
and cash equivalents include money market securities that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities
and are therefore classified as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy.  

In
addition, FASB ASC 825-10-25 Fair Value Option expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect
the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments.  

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable
and due to related parties approximate their estimated fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The carrying amount of the notes and convertible promissory notes approximates the estimated fair value for these financial instruments
as management believes that such notes constitute substantially all of the Company s debt and the interest payable on the
notes approximates the Company s incremental borrowing rate.

NOTE
1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)   

Accounts
Receivable   

The
Company has a policy of reserving for questionable accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses
in its existing accounts receivable. The Company uses specific identification of accounts to reserve possible uncollectible receivables.
The Company periodically reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an analysis of
past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account balances deemed
to be uncollectible are charged to the bad debt expense after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for
recovery is considered remote. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management determined that an allowance is necessary
which amounted to $38,000 at both dates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $20,275
and $0 respectively of expenses related to uncollectible accounts receivable.  

Advertising   

Advertising
is expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $176,618 and $267,903
respectively.  

Shipping
costs   

Shipping
costs are included in other selling, general and administrative expenses and was deemed to be not material for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Inventories   

Inventories,
consisting of finished goods related to our products are stated at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in, first-out
method. The Company acquires inventory for specific installation jobs. As a result, the Company generally orders inventory only
as needed for installations and there was an insignificant amount of inventory on hand at December 31, 2015. Due to the anticipation
of customers needs the Company purchased inventory items and had $23,748 in inventory as of September 30, 2016.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements
are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts,
and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. The Company examines the possibility of decreases
in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

Long-Lived
Assets of the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets
may not be recoverable, pursuant to guidance established in ASC 360-10-35-15,   Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  .
The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount
of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its book
value. The Company did not consider it necessary to record any impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015.

I ncome
Taxes   

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method as prescribed by ASC Topic 740: Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities, and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance, when in the Company s opinion it is likely that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized.  

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 740-10: Income Taxes related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the evaluation of a tax position
is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained
upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position.
The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit
to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized
tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial
reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. The accounting standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures, and transition. The adoption had no effect on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.  

Stock
Based Compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively,
the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for
an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
 measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is
reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based
on the fair value of the award at the reporting date. The Company recorded stock based compensation expense of $0 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recorded stock based
compensation of $44,100 to employees and $9,760 to non-employees.  

Revenue
recognition   

The
Company follows the guidance of the FASB ASC 605-10-S99  Revenue Recognition Overall   SEC Materials. The Company
records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred,
the s ales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.
When a customer order contains multiple items such as hardware, software, and services which are delivered at varying times, the
Company determines whether the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting. Delivered items should be considered
separate units of accounting if delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there is objective and reliable
evidence of the fair value of undelivered items, and if delivery of undelivered items is probable and substantially in the Company s
control. Sales are recorded net of discounts and discounts are determined to be immaterial.   

The
following policies reflect specific criteria for the   various
revenue streams of the Company:  

Revenue
is recognized upon completion of conferencing services. The Company generally does not charge up-front fees and bills its customers
based on usage.

NOTE

Revenue
for video equipment sales and security surveillance equipment sales is recognized upon delivery and installation.  Due
to the nature of the Company s business it is not practicable to return products therefore the Company has determined that
it is not necessary to provide a provision for sales returns and allowances. The Company s manufacturers provide the highest
quality products available.   If there is a defect in a product related to materials or workmanship
the Company extends the manufacturer s warranty to its customers. To date this process has never occurred. Therefore no
warranty liability is recorded.   

Revenue
from periodic maintenance agreements is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant
obligations remain and collectibility of the related receivable is probable.  

Cost
of sales includes cost of products and cost of service. Product cost includes the cost of products and freight costs. Cost of
services includes labor and fuel expenses.  

Concentrations
of Credit Risk and Major Customers   

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts
receivable. The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. Almost all of the Company s
sales are credit sales which are primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent upon the industry economics prevailing
in these areas; however, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is limited due to
generally short payment terms. The Company also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to help further
reduce credit risk.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, one customer accounted for 22% of revenues.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, three customers accounted for 60% of revenues. The following is a list of percentage
of revenue generated by the three customers:  

As
of September 30, 2016, two customers accounted for 60% of total accounts receivable. The following is a list of percentage of
accounts receivable owed by the two customers:  

As
of December 31, 2015, three customers accounted for 65% of total accounts receivable. The following is a list of percentage of
accounts receivable owed by the three customers:

Research
and Development   

Research
is planned search or critical investigation aimed at discovery of new knowledge with the hope that such knowledge will be useful
in developing a new product or service (hereinafter  product ) or a new process or technique (hereinafter  process )
or in bringing about a significant improvement to an existing product or process. Development is the translation of research findings
or other knowledge into a plan or design for a new product or process or for a significant improvement to an existing product
or process whether intended for sale or use. It includes the conceptual formulation, design, and testing of product alternatives,
construction of prototypes, and operation of pilot plants. It does not include routine or periodic alterations to existing products,
production lines, manufacturing processes, and other on-going operations even though those alterations may represent improvements
and it does not include market research or market testing activities. Per Statement of Financial Account Standards Number 2, the
Company expenses research and development cost as incurred.  

Related
Parties   

Parties
are considered to be related to the Company if the parties that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company,
its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with
which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other
to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company
discloses all related party transactions. All transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged.
Property purchased from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related
party in excess of the cost is reflected as a distribution to related party.  

Net
Loss per Common Share   

Net
loss per common share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260: Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260 ). Basic loss per
share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
The computation of diluted net earnings per share does not include dilutive common stock equivalents in the weighted average shares
outstanding as they would be anti-dilutive. At September 30, 2016 the Company had 1,475,345,119 share equivalents issuable pursuant
to embedded conversion features. At December 31, 2015 the Company had 1,240,096,048 share equivalents issuable pursuant to embedded
conversion features.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not expect the future adoption
of any such pronouncements to have a significant impact on the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, except
as described below.  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2014-09 )  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 establishes
a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes
most of the existing revenue recognition guidance and notes that lease contracts with customers are a scope exception. ASU 2014-09
requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional
disclosures. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09. Public business
entities may elect to adopt the amendments as of the original effective date; however, adoption is required for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial
statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE
2   GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS   

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. At
September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $25 million, a stockholders  deficit of approximately
$7 million and a working capital deficiency of $7,447,743. The net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 totaled $979,366.These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon increasing sales and obtaining additional
capital and financing. Management intends to attempt to raise funds by way of a public or private offering. While the Company
believes in the viability of its strategy to increase sales volume and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be
no assurances to that effect. The Company s limited financial resources have prevented the Company from aggressively advertising
its products and services to achieve consumer recognition. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments
to reflect the possible effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities
that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

the balance on a straight-line basis for the term of 2 years commencing in July 2014 and August 2015. In September 2016 the Company
moved its office to a different floor in the same building. Consequently, the company amortized the remainder of the leasehold
improvements during September 2016. The monthly rent expense remained the same. The original monthly rent was $5,000 per month
which was increased to $6,460 in November 2015.

NOTE
8   DERIVATIVE LIABILITY   

The
Company enters into financing arrangements that contain embedded derivative features due to down round ( Ratchet )
provisions or conversion formulas that cause derivative treatment. The Company accounts for these arrangements in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification topic 815, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( ASC 815 )
as well as related interpretation of this standard. In accordance with this standard, derivative instruments are recognized as
either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and are measured at fair values with gains or losses recognized in earnings.
The Company determines the fair value of derivative instruments based on available market data using appropriate valuation models,
considering all of the rights and obligations of each instrument.

NOTE
8   DERIVATIVE LIABILITY (continued)   

We
estimate fair values of derivative financial instruments using various techniques (and combinations thereof) that are considered
consistent with the objective measuring fair values. In selecting the appropriate technique, we consider, among other factors,
the nature of the instrument, the market risks that it embodies and the expected means of settlement. For less complex derivative
instruments we generally use the Black-Scholes model, adjusted for the effect of dilution, because it embodies all of the requisite
assumptions (including trading volatility, estimated terms, dilution and risk free rates) necessary to fair value these instruments.
Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that
may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors.
In addition, option-based techniques (such as Black-Scholes model) are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading
market price of our common stock. Since derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair values,
our income (expense) going forward will reflect the volatility in these estimates and assumption changes. Under the terms of the
new accounting standard, increases in the trading price of the Company s common stock and increases in fair value during
a given financial quarter result in the application of non-cash derivative expense. Conversely, decreases in the trading price
of the Company s common stock and decreases in trading fair value during a given financial quarter result in the application
of non-cash derivative income.  

The
following table presents a reconciliation of the derivative liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2016:  

Total
derivative liability at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounted to $2,637,863 and $3,718,242, respectively. The change
in fair value included in earnings of $1,472,386 is due in part to the quoted market price of the Company s common stock
decreasing from $.126 at December 31, 2015 to $.0024 at September 30, 2016 coupled with substantially reduced conversion prices
due to the effect of  Ratchet  provisions incorporated in convertible notes payable.  

The
Company used the following assumptions for determining the fair value of the convertible instruments granted under the Black-Scholes
option pricing model:

NOTE
15   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

Subsequent
to September 30, 2016 the Company issued 58,941,209 shares of common stock upon conversion of $51,820 of convertible
promissory notes and $500 of accrued interest.  These notes were converted at contractual rates ranging from $.00066 to

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.    

Overview   

Our
company was formed in October 2006 and immediately thereafter we acquired Ralston Communication Services and Meeting Technologies
from DirectView, Inc., a Nevada corporation of which Mr. and Mrs. Ralston were officers and directors immediately prior to such
acquisition, in exchange for the assumption by us of these subsidiaries working capital deficiencies and any and all trade credit
and other liabilities. Both of these entities had historically provided the video conferencing services we continue to provide.
Thereafter, in February 2007, we formed DirectView Security Systems, Inc. ( DirectView Security ) and in July
2007 we formed DirectView Video. DirectView Security began offering services and products immediately from inception.  

Our
operations are conducted within two divisions:  

The
    vast majority of our business is derived from our security division which provides surveillance systems, digital video recording
    and services to businesses, organizations and law enforcement, and   

Our
    video conferencing division which is a full-service provider of teleconferencing products and services to businesses and organizations.   

We
operate our security division through DirectView Security where we provide a wide array of video and audio hardware and software
options to create custom security and surveillance solutions for large and small businesses as well as residential customers.
The Company currently services customers in transportation, hotel and hospitality, education, cannabis, food services, and real
estate industries.  

We
provide our customers with the latest technologies in surveillance systems, digital video recording and services. The systems
provide onsite and remote video and audio surveillance. We generate revenue through the sale and installation of surveillance
systems and the sale of maintenance agreements. We source our products from a variety of different suppliers and our product and
service offerings include:  

DRV
    Recorders and Cameras  
      Video
    Intercoms   

NVR
    Recorders and IP Cameras   
      Laser
    and Video Beam Perimeter Security   

Motion
    Detection and Thermal Imagery   
      Security
    Design and Consulting   

Remote
    Control Device Management   
      Equipment
    Maintenance Service Plans   

Access
    Control Solutions  

We
have also developed custom software programs and applications to work with the products we offer to customers to enhance their
convenience and capability. We have developed a mobile application which we call the  DirectView Security App  to
enable full remote management of deployed surveillance devices including positioning cameras, setting recording parameters, and
replay of selected video. The DirectView Security App provides full encryption and is compatible with all Apple and Android based
mobile devices. We are also in late stage development of a proprietary software platform targeted for educational institutions/daycare,
aviation, and religious organizations. The platform will enable tiered database controlled access to multiple encrypted live streaming
videos with audio with full scalability. The software will allow these businesses and organizations to provide parents, patrons
or customers access to see to view a particular classroom, attend a religious service, or watch any activity permitted by the
licensor of the software through any internet connected mobile device or computer.  

We
target businesses of various sizes ranging from residential to large scale businesses. Our main markets can be divided into five
categories which include:  

-Transportation
(Airport, Heliport, and Bus Terminal)  

-Hospitality
(Hotel, Golf Course, Food Service and Bars/Restaurant)  

-Industrial
(Warehousing and Storage, Cannabis Grow House and Dispensary, and Manufacturing)  

-Educational
(Daycare, Private School, Learning Center/Religious Organization)  

-Residential
(Condo/Co-op, Property Management Company, and Private Home)  

Beginning
in 2014, we focused a significant amount of our business development and marketing efforts towards the legalized cannabis industry.
We see this market as a strong growth area for the Company due to our belief that the political landscape will continue to move
towards the legalization of marijuana for medical and recreational use across the country. By  the
middle of 2013, 18 states and the District of Columbia have already allowed the production and use of marijuana for medical purposes.
Two states, Colorado and Washington, also have approved cannabis for recreational use.  Additionally, many large security
service providers have publicly avoided servicing businesses engaged in the sale or growing of marijuana which we believe lowers
the competitive landscape.  

In
addition to conducting direct sales activities to businesses operating in this market, we also focus on partnerships with other
service providers in the industry that are generally involved in the design and construction of facilities to grow and dispense
marijuana. We have  a preferred provider agreement with Legacy Construction Company
of Colorado, LLC ( Legacy ). Under the terms of the preferred provider agreement, Legacy directs their retail
and marijuana facility construction clients to DirectView for video surveillance and security needs. Legacy has over fifteen years
of experience and expertise in commercial general contracting with specific experience in the retail and medical marijuana industry.
Legacy holds a Class A general contractors license in six states including Colorado,Wyoming, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah,
and Arizona.  We also have a strategic partnership agreement with Cannamor, LLC ( Cannamor ), a privately
held Colorado based consulting company focusing on legal cannabis growing and dispensing projects, where we are engaged as its
exclusive security solutions provider. Under the terms of the agreement, Cannamor exclusively endorses and recommends DirectView
as its vendor of choice for the planning and installation of video surveillance, video monitoring, video recording products and
related services to its prospective clients. Both of these arrangements have led to sales and a number of large potential project
leads within our sales pipeline. We continue to see this industry as a growing part of our security and surveillance business
for the foreseeable future.  

In
an effort to further expand our market opportunities, in April 2015, we began preparations to develop a unique body-worn-camera
solution to target law enforcement, business security and homeland security markets. We expect the solution to comprise of a line
of body-worn-cameras integrated with a suite of communications capabilities  including
high capacity streaming video,  Bluetooth  , GPS, push to talk, WIFI/4G LTE, and imbedded biometric access .
 We are also working to integrate the video feeds with backend storage solutions for video/audio
storage including playback and editing of stored evidence.  We have received body-worn-camera prototypes that have
been manufactured to our design specifications by a large third party manufacturer and we are currently beta testing those prototypes.
We intend to have that manufacturer produce a finished product upon successful completion of product testing.  

In
order to enhance the communications capability of the solution as well as our marketing capabilities, we entered into an agreement
with  xG Technology, Inc. ( xG ), a developer of wireless communications
and spectrum sharing technologies, to integrate our body-worn-camera device and related hardware with xG s xMax private
mobile broadband technology. The planned integration will consolidate the private, secure, high-performance communications capabilities
of xMax with the features and functionality of our body-worn cameras.   

We
intend to offer our body-worn-cameras and the related suite of communications and storage solutions to our target customers through
both direct sales and strategic partnerships with companies that sell complimentary products in the areas of law enforcement,
homeland security and private security. In addition to our integration agreement with xG, we entered into  a
co-marketing agreement with PositiveID Corporation ( PSID   ), a developer
of diagnostic testing systems for use by first responders, to jointly market both companies  products to homeland security
and first responder markets.  We believe that co-marketing and product integration agreements such as these will expand
the breadth of our product offerings and enable us to leverage the marketing capabilities of our partners to increase sales opportunities
upon product launch.  

Our
video conferencing products and services enable our clients to cost-effectively conduct remote meetings by linking participants
in geographically dispersed locations. Our primary focus is to provide high value-added conferencing products and services to
organizations such as commercial, government, medical and educational sectors. We generate revenue through the sale of conferencing
services based upon usage, the sale and installation of video equipment and the sale of maintenance agreements.  

Our
Outlook    

Our
net sales are currently not sufficient to fund our operating expenses. We have relied upon funds from the issuance of notes, the
sale of common stock and advances from our executive officers to provide working capital to our company. These funds, however,
are not sufficient to pay all of our expenses nor to provide the additional capital we believe is necessary to permit us to properly
market our company in an effort to increase our sales. We are always looking for opportunities with new dealers to expand our
IP based surveillance products offerings and plan to evaluate the market for our products throughout 2016 to determine whether
we should hire additional employees in our sales force. We seek to leverage our current customer base which includes major international
hotel chains, well known real estate development companies, and respected educational facilities, to build our reputation as a
trusted security provider and generate customer referrals. Beginning in 2014 we also began targeting our marketing efforts
toward the cannabis industry. We see the specific security needs of this industry, representing a significant opportunity for
sales growth. Each state has specific requirements for security which includes extensive video surveillance and perimeter
security. Additionally, some larger security companies have been hesitant to enter this market up to this point we believe this
will help reduce competitive pressures. While we believe our strategy for growth will result in an increase in demand for our
products and service and generate revenues, no assurance can be provided that we will successfully implement our strategy. We
are subject to significant business risks and may need to raise additional capital in order to realize and effectuate the above
strategy.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   

   Compared
to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Net
Sales   

Overall,
our net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately 65% and 36% from the comparable periods
in 2015. The following table provides comparative data regarding the source of our net sales in each of these periods and the
change from 2016 to 2015:  

Sales
of product for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately 68% as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease is attributed to a lower sales force in the three months ended September 30, 2016. Sales of product for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased approximately 29% as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 attributed
to a lower sales force in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Service revenue decreased by approximately 52% and 50% in
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, due to customers decreasing
their service needs in 2016 compared to 2015.  

Net
sales decreased due to lower customers  service needs. In an effort to continue to increase our sales in future periods,
we believe we need to hire additional sales staff to initiate a telemarketing campaign and to obtain leads from various lead
sources such as lead generating telemarketing lists, email marketing campaigns and other sources. However, given our lack of working
capital, we cannot assure that we will ever be able to successfully implement our current business strategy or increase our revenues
in future periods.  

Cost
of Sales   

Cost
of product includes product and delivery costs relating to the sale of product revenue. Cost of services includes labor and installation
for service revenue. Overall, cost of sales decreased approximately 84% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to September 30, 2015. Cost of sales decreased approximately 38% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to September
30, 2015. The following table provides comparative data regarding the breakdown of the cost of sales in each of these periods
and the change from 2016 to 2015:  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our cost of product decreased approximately 91% as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015 which is directly related to the decrease in product sales for the same period. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, our cost of product decreased approximately 37% as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which
is also directly related to the decrease in product sales for the same period. Our cost of services for 2016 decreased 68%
and 39% as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to less installation fees for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Total
operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $377,101, a decrease of $63,581, or approximately 14%, from
total operating expenses for the comparable three months ended September 30, 2015 of $440,682. This decrease is primarily attributable
to compensation and related taxes and less marketing efforts offset slightly by bad debt expense recognized in the three months
ended September 30, 2016  

  .  

  Total
operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,217,148, an increase of $42,837, or approximately 4%,
from total operating expenses for the comparable nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $1,174,311.This increase is primarily
attributable to an increase in legal and accounting expenses, research and development, bad debt expense which was offset by a
decrease in rent expense and a decrease in marketing and public relations expense.  

Loss
from Operations   

We
reported a loss from operations of $315,980 and $1,048,719 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to a loss from operations of $377,633 and $924,731 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. This represented a
decrease of $61,653 or 16% and an increase of $123,988 or 13% respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Other
Income (Expense)   

Total
other income was $1,005,095 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to total other expense of $990,832
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other income was primarily attributable to the change in fair value
of derivative liabilities. Total other expense was $505,218 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to total
other expense of $1,450,748 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in other expense was primarily attributable
to a decrease in initial derivative expense and a decrease in loss on conversion of related party loans offset by an increase
in change in fair value of derivative liabilities and an increase in amortization of debt discount.  

Net
Income (Loss)   

We
reported a net income of $689,115 and a net loss of $1,553,937 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to a net loss of $1,368,465 and $2,375,479 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net loss from non-controlling
interest for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,107 and $3,525 respectively compared to net income of $44,862
and $94,798 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $27,261. Our working capital deficit is $7,447,743
at September 30, 2016.  

We
reported a net decrease in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $302,754. While we currently have no material
commitments for capital expenditures, at September 30, 2016 we owed approximately $141,792 under various notes payable. During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, we have raised $726,644 of net proceeds from convertible notes payable.  

Accrued

On
April 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) to issue and sell a 5% Original
Issue Discount Convertible Promissory Note (the  Note  and together with the SPA, the  Transaction Documents )
to an institutional investor (the  Investor ), in the principal amount of $105,263 (the  Principal Amount ).
Pursuant to the Transaction Documents, on or about April 1, 2016, the Company received $100,000 (before expenses and fees) in
funding from the Investor. The Company s issuance of the securities to the Investor pursuant to the SPA are exempt from
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.  

The
Note shall mature on March 31, 2017 (the  Maturity Date ) and shall accrue interest at an annual rate equal to 10%.
The Principal Amount shall be paid on the Maturity Date (or sooner as provided in the Note) in cash. The interest shall be paid
on the Maturity Date (or sooner as provided in the Note) in cash or in shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0001
per share (the  Common Stock ). In accordance with the terms of the Note, the Investor shall be entitled to convert
a portion or all of the Principal Amount and interest due and outstanding under the Note into shares of Common Stock equal to
70% of the lowest traded price in the prior thirty (30) trading days.  

On
September 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) to issue and sell a 5% Original
Issue Discount Convertible Promissory Note (the  Note  and together with the SPA, the  Transaction Documents )
to an institutional investor (the  Investor ), in the principal amount of $157,895 (the  Principal Amount )
in multiple tranches. Pursuant to the Transaction Documents, on or about September 1, 2016, the Company received $25,000 (before
expenses and fees) related to the first tranche in funding from the Investor. The Company s issuance of the securities to
the Investor pursuant to the SPA are exempt from registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities
Act ), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities
Act.  

The
Note and tranches shall mature on twelve months following the funding of each tranche (the  Maturity Date ) and shall
accrue interest at an annual rate equal to 10%. The Principal Amount shall be paid on the Maturity Date (or sooner as provided
in the Note) in cash. The interest shall be paid on the Maturity Date (or sooner as provided in the Note) in cash or in shares
of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Common Stock ). In accordance with the terms
of the Note, the Investor shall be entitled to convert a portion or all of the Principal Amount and interest due and outstanding
under the Note into shares of Common Stock equal to 60% of the lowest traded price in the prior thirty (30) trading days.  

Our
net sales are not sufficient to fund our operating expenses. We will need to raise significant additional capital to fund our
operating expenses, pay our obligations, and grow our company. We reported a net loss of $1,553,937 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016 we had a working capital deficit of $7,447,743. We do not anticipate we will be profitable
in 2016. Therefore our operations will be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing. Financing transactions may
include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. The trading price
of our common stock and a downturn in the U.S. equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through
the issuance of equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur
unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that
would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may
experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing
holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital may restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability
to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will likely be required to curtail
our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations. Furthermore we have debt obligations, which must be satisfied.
If we are successful in securing additional working capital, we intend to increase our marketing efforts to grow our revenues.
Other than those disclosed above, we do not presently have any firm commitments for any additional capital and our financial condition
as well as the uncertainty in the capital markets may make our ability to secure this capital difficult. There are no assurances
that we will be able to continue our business, and we may be forced to cease operations in which event investors could lose their
entire investment in our company. Included in our Notes to the financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and the year ended December 31, 2015 is a discussion regarding Going Concern.  

Operating
activities

cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $976,366 and was primarily attributable
to our net loss of $1,553,937 coupled with a change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $1,472,386 and a decrease in other
assets of $47,687. The losses were offset by depreciation of $15,156, derivative liability expenses of $230,036, amortization
of debt discount of $1,460,187, amortization of deferred financing costs of $4,583, amortization of original issue discount of

Contractual
Obligations   

We
have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs,
cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates.
We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant
assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information
within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  

The
following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016, and the effect these obligations are expected
to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s applications
of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for our company include revenue recognition and accounting for stock based
compensation, use of estimates, accounts receivable, property and equipment and income taxes.  

Revenue
Recognition   

We
follow the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 for revenue recognition. In
general, we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery
has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. When a customer
order contains multiple items such as hardware, software, and services which are delivered at varying times, we determine whether
the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting. Delivered items should be considered separate units of accounting
if delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value
of undelivered items, and if delivery of undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control. The following policies
reflect specific criteria for our various revenues streams:  

Revenue
    is recognized upon completion of conferencing services. We generally do not charge up-front fees and bill our customers based
    on usage.   

Revenue
    for video equipment sales and security surveillance equipment sales is recognized upon delivery and installation.   

Revenue
    from periodic maintenance agreements is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant
    obligations remain and collectability of the related receivable is probable.   

Stock
Based Compensation   

In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB ASC Topic 718: Compensation   Stock Compensation
( ASC 718 ). Under ASC 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements
based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees
are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based
awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. Companies may elect to apply this statement either prospectively,
or on a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis
consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under ASC 718. Upon adoption of ASC 718, the Company elected
to value employee stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation method that uses assumptions that relate to the expected
volatility of the Company s common stock, the expected dividend yield of our stock, the expected life of the options and
the risk free interest rate. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods or period of
service of the option grant.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the
reported net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

Account
Receivable   

We
have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts based on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing
accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance is necessary based on an
analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Account
balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential
for recovery is considered remote.  

Property
and Equipment   

Property
and equipment are carried at cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements
are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts,
and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. The Company examines the possibility of decreases
in the value of fixed assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.  

Income
Taxes   

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method as prescribed by ASC Topic 740: Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ).
It requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted
for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the balance sheet date.  

Deferred
tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation
of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and
deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probably that taxable profit will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilized.  

Deferred
tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.  

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to
settle our current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.  

Pursuant
to accounting standards related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only
if it is  more likely than not  that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination
being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
on examination. For tax positions not meeting the  more likely than not  test, no tax benefit is recorded. The
adoption had no effect on our financial statements.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   and Adoption of New Accounting Principles   

There
are no recent accounting pronouncements or new accounting principles that have an effect on the Company s financial statements,
except as described below.  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2014-09 )  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 establishes
a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes
most of the existing revenue recognition guidance and notes that lease contracts with customers are a scope exception. ASU 2014-09
requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional
disclosures. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09. Public business
entities may elect to adopt the amendments as of the original effective date; however, adoption is required for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial
statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties.
We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as stockholder s equity
or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity.  

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

Not required for smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, including Roger Ralston,
our chief executive officer, and Michele Ralston, our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. 

Disclosure controls and procedures refer
to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to
apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. 

Management conducted its evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer. Based
on that evaluation, our management, including Roger Ralston, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michele Ralston, our Chief Financial
Officer, concluded that because of the significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting described below, our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Management s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting  

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(F) and 15d-15(F) under the Securities
Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( Section 404 ) on an annual basis. As previously
reported on our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, management identified significant deficiencies related to (i) our
internal audit functions and (ii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions. 

Management has determined that our internal
audit function is significantly deficient due to insufficient qualified resources to perform internal audit functions. 

Due to our size and nature, segregation
of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, we
will implement procedures to assure that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions
will be performed by separate individuals. 

We believe that the foregoing steps
will remediate the material weaknesses identified above, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these steps and make
any changes that our management deems appropriate. Due to the nature of these material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting, there is more than a remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to our annual or interim
financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected. 

Changes in Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal
controls over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

We are currently not involved in any litigation
that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body
pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting
our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries officers or directors in their capacities
as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.  

We believe there are no changes that constitute
material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016.

promissory note net of debt discount, deferred financing and OID as of September 30, 2016 amounted to $724. 

On September 1, 2016 the Company executed a
Securities Purchase Agreement (SPA). In connection with the SPA the Company may issue 5% original issue discount (OID) convertible
promissory notes with an aggregate principal balance amounting to $157,895. In connection with the SPA, on September 1, 2016 the
Company issued a 5% original issue discount (OID) convertible promissory note with a principal balance of $157,895. This convertible
debenture converts at 60% of the lowest trading price during the 30 days prior to conversion. The promissory note will be fulfilled
by issuing multiple tranches. On September 1, 2016, at the closing of the first tranche, the outstanding principle amount totaled
$32,895. Each tranche will have a twelve month maturity date following the issuances of the tranche. The Company also recorded
OID of $7,895. The OID and debt discount are being amortized over the term of the note. The balance of the convertible promissory
note amounted to $32,895 as of September 30, 2016. The balance of the convertible promissory note net of debt discount and OID
as of September 30, 2016 amounted to $2,741.

On October 18, 2016 the Company issued a 5%
original issue discount (OID) convertible promissory note with a principal balance of $26,316 with a six month maturity date. This
convertible debenture converts at 70% of the lowest trading price during the 30 days prior to conversion. The Company also will
record OID of $1,316. The OID and debt discount will be amortized over the term of the note. 

On October 28, 2016 the Company issued a 5%
original issue discount (OID) convertible promissory note with a principal balance of $26,316 with a six month maturity date. This
convertible debenture converts at 70% of the lowest trading price during the 30 days prior to conversion. The Company also will
record OID of $1,316. The OID and debt discount will be amortized over the term of the note. 

In the period of July 1, 2016 through September
30, 2016 the Company issued 48,070,511 shares of common stock at contractual rates ranging from $.00121 to $.003 for the conversion
of $96,595 in principal of convertible notes payable and $1,500 in the conversion of accrued interest. 

Subsequent to September 30, 2016 the Company
issued 46,623,027 shares of common stock upon conversion of $43,210 of convertible promissory notes and $500 of accrued interest.
These notes were converted at contractual rates ranging from $.00072 to $.00126. 

The preceding securities were not registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), but qualified for exemption under Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act. The securities were exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act because the issuance
of such securities by the Company did not involve a  public offering,  as defined in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act, due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the transaction, size of the offering, and manner of the offering and
number of securities offered. The Company did not undertake an offering in which it sold a high number of securities to a high
number of investors. In addition, the Investor had the necessary investment intent as required by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act since they agreed to, and received, the securities bearing a legend stating that such securities are restricted pursuant to
Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these securities would not be immediately redistributed into the
market and therefore not be part of a  public offering.  Based on an analysis of the above factors, the Company has
met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

Other than as disclosed above, there were no
unregistered sales of the Company s equity securities during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that were not previously disclosed
in a current report on Form 8-K, or quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
