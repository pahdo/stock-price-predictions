  MYLAN N.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

The accompanying unaudited   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   (   interim financial statements   ) of   Mylan N.V.   and subsidiaries ( Mylan  or the  Company ) were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for reporting on Form 10-Q; therefore, as permitted under these rules, certain footnotes and other financial information included in audited financial statements were condensed or omitted. The interim financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the interim results of operations, comprehensive earnings, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented. For periods prior to February 27, 2015, the Company s   interim financial statements   present the accounts of Mylan Inc. and subsidiaries.  
  These   interim financial statements   should be read in conjunction with the   Consolidated Financial Statements   and   Notes   thereto in   Mylan N.V.   s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as amended. The   December 31, 2015     Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet   was derived from audited financial statements. 
  The interim results of operations and comprehensive earnings for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year or any other future period.  
   
           2. 
    Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable 
     The Company recognizes net sales when title and risk of loss pass to its customers and when provisions for estimates, including discounts, sales allowances, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks and other promotional programs are reasonably determinable. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions. No significant revisions were made to the methodology used in determining these provisions during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Such allowances were   $1.83 billion   and   $1.84 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Other current liabilities include   $824.1 million   and   $681.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for certain sales allowances and other adjustments that are paid to customers. 
  Through its wholly owned subsidiary Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( MPI ), the Company has access to a   $400 million   accounts receivable securitization facility (the  Receivables Facility ). The receivables underlying any borrowings are included in accounts receivable, net, in the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . There were   $759.3 million   and   $914.2 million   of securitized accounts receivable at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
           3. 
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
     In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-16,   Income Taxes (Topic 740)   ( ASU 2016-16 ), which reduces the complexity in the accounting standards by allowing the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted using a modified retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted using a retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its Statement of Cash Flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which simplifies the accounting for share-based compensation payments. The new standard requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within

those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 840)   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which provides principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than twelve months regardless of classification. Leases with a term of twelve months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ), which requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting). The amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive earnings the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09  updated with  ASU 2015-14 ,  ASU 2016-08 ,  ASU 2016-10  and  ASU 2016-12 ), which revises accounting guidance on revenue recognition that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principal of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, and can be applied using a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

    Acquisitions and Other Transactions 
     Meda AB    
  On   February 10, 2016  , the Company issued an offer announcement under the Nasdaq Stockholm s Takeover Rules and the Swedish Takeover Act (collectively, the  Swedish Takeover Rules ) setting forth a public offer to the shareholders of   Meda AB   (publ.) (   Meda   ) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of   Meda   (the    Offer   ), with an enterprise value, including the net debt of   Meda  , of approximately Swedish kronor ( SEK  or  kr )   83.6 billion   (based on a SEK/USD exchange rate of   8.4158  ) or   $9.9 billion   at announcement. On   August 2, 2016  , the Company announced that the Offer was accepted by Meda shareholders holding an aggregate of approximately   343 million   shares, representing approximately   94%   of the total number of outstanding Meda shares, as of   July 29, 2016  , and the Company declared the Offer unconditional. On   August 5, 2016  , settlement occurred with respect to the Meda shares duly tendered by July 29, 2016 and, as a result, Meda is now a controlled subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Offer, each Meda shareholder that duly tendered Meda shares into the Offer received at settlement (1) in respect of   80%   of the number of Meda shares tendered by such shareholder,   165kr   in cash per Meda share, and (2) in respect of the remaining   20%   of the number of Meda shares tendered by such shareholder,   0.386   of the Company s ordinary shares per Meda share (subject to treatment of fractional shares as described in the offer document published on June 16, 2016). The non-tendered shares will be acquired for cash through a compulsory acquisition proceeding, in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)), with advance title to such non-tendered shares expected to be acquired within six to twelve months of the acquisition date. The compulsory acquisition proceeding price will accrue interest as required by the Swedish Companies Act. Meda s shares were delisted from the Nasdaq Stockholm

exchange on August 23, 2016. On November 1, 2016, the Company made an offer to the remaining Meda shareholders to tender all their Meda shares for cash consideration of   161.31kr   per Meda share (the  November Offer ) to provide such remaining shareholders with an opportunity to sell their shares in Meda to the Company in advance of the automatic acquisition of their shares for cash in connection with the compulsory acquisition proceeding. The acceptance period for the November Offer expires on November 23, 2016 and settlement is expected to occur on or around November 30, 2016. Meda shareholders who tender their shares in the November Offer will not have the right to withdraw their acceptances, and there are no conditions to the completion of the November Offer. Any Meda shareholders that do not accept the November Offer will automatically receive all-cash consideration plus statutory interest for their Meda shares as determined in the compulsory acquisition proceeding. The November Offer is not being made, nor will any tender of shares be accepted from or on behalf of holders in, any jurisdiction in which the making of the November Offer or the acceptance of any tender of shares would contravene applicable laws or regulations or require any offer documents, filings or other measures. In connection with either the November Offer or the compulsory acquisition proceeding, it has been assumed that the fair value of the non-tendered shares would be approximately   161kr   per share at settlement.  
  The total purchase price was approximately   $6.92 billion  , net of cash acquired, which includes cash consideration paid of approximately   $5.3 billion  , the issuance of approximately   26.4 million   Mylan N.V. ordinary shares at a fair value of approximately   $1.3 billion   based on the closing price of the Company s ordinary shares on   August 5, 2016  , as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market (the  NASDAQ ) and an assumed liability of approximately   $431.0 million   related to the November Offer and the compulsory acquisition proceeding of the non-tendered Meda shares, which is classified as a current liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company used the acquisition method of accounting to account for this transaction. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction have been recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs of approximately   $65.8 million   and   $212.5 million   were incurred during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which were recorded as components of research and development expense ( R D ), selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A ), interest expense and other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , these costs include approximately   $44.4 million   and   $128.6 million  , respectively, of losses on non-designated foreign currency forward and option contracts entered into in order to economically hedge the SEK purchase price of the Offer (explained further in Note   11     Financial Instruments and Risk Management  ). For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   acquisition related costs include approximately   $45.2 million   of financing fees related to the terminated 2016 Bridge Credit Agreement (explained further in Note   12     Debt  ). 
  The preliminary allocation of the   $6.92 billion   purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Meda is as follows:   

  The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon preliminary calculations, valuations and assumptions that are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information during the

     Table of Contents

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued 

measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas subject to change relate to the finalization of the working capital components, the valuation of intangible assets and income taxes.  
  The acquisition of Meda creates a more diversified and expansive portfolio of branded and generic medicines along with a strong and growing portfolio of over-the-counter ( OTC ) products. The combined company has a balanced global footprint with significant scale in key geographic markets, particularly the U.S. and Europe. The acquisition of Meda also provides Mylan with entry into a number of new and attractive emerging markets, including China, Southeast Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Mexico, complemented by Mylan s presence in India, Brazil and Africa. The Company recorded a step-up in the fair value of inventory of approximately   $107 million  . During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded amortization of the inventory step-up of approximately   $42.8 million  , which is included in cost of sales in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  .  
  The identified intangible assets of   $8.06 billion   are comprised of product rights and licenses that have a weighted average useful life of   20 years  . Significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of identified intangible assets were based on company specific information and projections which are not observable in the market and are thus considered Level 3 measurements as defined by U.S. GAAP. The goodwill of   $3.68 billion   arising from the acquisition consisted largely of the value of the employee workforce and the expected value of products to be developed in the future. The newly acquired operations have been included in the Generics segment for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . In addition, all of the goodwill was assigned to the Generics segment.   None   of the goodwill recognized in this transaction is currently expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  
  The settlement of the Offer constituted an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Rottapharm Agreement referred to below) under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2014 (the  Rottapharm Agreement ), among Fidim S.r.l., Meda Pharma S.p.A and Meda, the occurrence of which accelerated an unconditional deferred purchase price payment of approximately   $308 million   (   275 million  ) relating to Meda s acquisition of Rottapharm S.p.A. which otherwise would have been payable in January 2017. The amount was paid as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The operating results of   Meda   have been included in the Company s   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations   since the acquisition date. The total revenues of   Meda   for the period from the acquisition date to   September 30, 2016  , were   $331.1 million   and net loss, net of tax, was   $260.6 million  . The net loss, net of tax, includes the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition related costs.  
  Renaissance     Topicals Business 
  On   June 15, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of the non-sterile, topicals-focused business (the    Topicals Business   ) of   Renaissance Acquisition Holdings, LLC   (   Renaissance   ) for approximately   $1.0 billion   in cash at closing, including amounts deposited into escrow for potential contingent payments, subject to customary adjustments. The   Topicals Business   provides the Company with a complementary portfolio of approximately   25   products, an active pipeline of approximately   25   products, and an established U.S. sales and marketing infrastructure targeting dermatologists. The   Topicals Business   also provides an integrated manufacturing and development platform. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company used the acquisition method of accounting to account for this transaction. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction were recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The U.S. GAAP purchase price was   $972.7 million  , which includes estimated contingent consideration of approximately   $16 million   related to the potential   $50 million   payment contingent on the achievement of certain 2016 financial targets. The   $50 million   contingent payment has been paid into escrow. The preliminary allocation of the   $972.7 million   purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the   Topicals Business   is as follows:

The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon preliminary calculations, valuations and assumptions that are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas subject to change relate to the finalization of the working capital adjustment and income taxes.  
  The acquisition of the   Topicals Business   broadened the Company s dermatological portfolio. The amount allocated to in-process research and development ( IPR D ) represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the closing date of the acquisition, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The fair value of IPR D of   $275.0 million   was based on the excess earnings method, which utilizes forecasts of expected cash inflows (including estimates for ongoing costs) and other contributory charges. A discount rate of   12.5%   was utilized to discount net cash inflows to present values. IPR D is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and will be subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion and launch of each product, the Company will make a determination of the estimated useful life of the individual asset. The acquired IPR D projects are in various stages of completion and the estimated costs to complete these projects total approximately   $65 million  , which is expected to be incurred through 2018. There are risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the projects included in IPR D, and no assurances can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate the fair value of IPR D will not change or the timely completion of each project to commercial success will occur.  
  The identified intangible assets of   $467.0 million   are comprised of   $454.0 million   of product rights and licenses that have a weighted average useful life   14 years   and   $13.0 million   of contract manufacturing agreements that have a weighted average useful life of   five years  . Significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of identified intangible assets were based on company specific information and projections which are not observable in the market and are thus considered Level 3 measurements as defined by U.S. GAAP.  
  The goodwill of   $307.3 million   arising from the acquisition consisted largely of the value of the employee workforce and the expected value of products to be developed in the future. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Generics segment.   None   of the goodwill recognized in this transaction is currently expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Acquisition related costs of approximately   $3.6 million   were incurred during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   related to this transaction, which were recorded as a component of SG A in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations since the acquisition date or on a pro forma basis for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Jai Pharma Limited 
  On November 20, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of certain female healthcare businesses from   Famy Care Limited   (such businesses    Jai Pharma Limited   ).

a cash payment of   $750 million   plus additional contingent payments of up to   $50 million   for the filing for approval with, and receipt of approval from, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of a product under development by   Jai Pharma Limited  . 
  In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company used the acquisition method of accounting to account for this transaction. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction were recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The U.S. GAAP purchase price was   $711.1 million  , which excludes the   $50 million   paid into escrow at closing that is contingent upon at least   one   of   two   former principal shareholders of   Jai Pharma Limited   continuing to provide consulting services to   Jai Pharma Limited   for the   two   year post-closing period, which amount is being treated as compensation expense over the service period. The U.S. GAAP purchase price also excludes   $7 million   of working capital and other adjustments and includes estimated contingent consideration of approximately   $18 million   related to the   $50 million   contingent payment. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , adjustments were made to the preliminary purchase price allocation recorded at November 20, 2015. The adjustments recorded in respect of goodwill, current liabilities and deferred tax liabilities are reflected in the  measurement period adjustments  column of the table below. As of   September 30, 2016  , the preliminary allocation of the   $711.1 million   purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for   Jai Pharma Limited   is as follows:   
 ____________  
            (a)   
    As previously reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as amended.  
               (b)   
    The measurement period adjustments were recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and are related to the recognition of certain goodwill, current liabilities and adjustments to deferred tax liabilities to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. 
     The goodwill of   $325.3 million   arising from the acquisition consisted largely of the value of the employee workforce and the expected value of products to be developed in the future. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Generics segment. The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon preliminary calculations, valuations and assumptions that are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas subject to change relate to the finalization of the working capital adjustment and income taxes, which will be finalized in the fourth quarter of 2016. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received approvals from the relevant Indian regulatory authorities to legally merge its wholly owned subsidiary,   Jai Pharma Limited  , into   Mylan Laboratories Limited  . The merger resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of   $150 million   for the tax deductible goodwill in excess of the book goodwill with a corresponding benefit to income tax provision for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . On a pro forma basis, the acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

EPD Business 
  On   February 27, 2015   (the  EPD Transaction Closing Date ), the Company completed the acquisition (the  EPD Transaction ) of Mylan Inc. and Abbott Laboratories  non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business (the  EPD Business ) in an all-stock transaction.   Mylan N.V.   s purchase price for the   EPD Business  , which was on a debt-free basis, was   $6.31 billion   based on the closing price of Mylan Inc. s stock as of the EPD Transaction Closing Date, as reported by the NASDAQ.  
  The operating results of the EPD Business have been included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations since February 27, 2015. The total revenues of the acquired EPD Business for the period from the acquisition date to   September 30, 2015   were   $1.01 billion   and the net loss, net of tax, was   $68.6 million  . The net loss, net of tax, includes the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition related costs.  
  Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Results 
  The following table presents supplemental unaudited pro forma information for the acquisitions of   Meda  , as if it had occurred on   January 1, 2015  , and the   EPD Business  , as if it had occurred on   January 1, 2014  . The unaudited pro forma results reflect certain adjustments related to past operating performance and acquisition accounting adjustments, such as increased amortization expense based on the fair value of assets acquired, the impact of transaction costs and the related income tax effects. The unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated synergies which may be achievable, or have been achieved, subsequent to the closing of the   Meda   transaction and EPD Transaction. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the acquisitions been completed on the stated dates above, nor are they indicative of the future operating results of   Mylan N.V.   and its subsidiaries.  

Other Transactions 
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a marketed pharmaceutical product for an upfront payment of approximately   $57.9 million  , which is included in investing activities in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows  . The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and is amortizing the product right over a weighted useful life of   five years  . 
  On January 8, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with   Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   (   Momenta   ) to develop, manufacture and commercialize up to   six   of   Momenta   s current biosimilar candidates, including   Momenta   s biosimilar candidate, ORENCIA  (abatacept). As part of the agreement, Mylan made an up-front cash payment of   $45 million   to Momenta. Under the terms of the agreement, Momenta is eligible to receive additional contingent milestone payments of   up to     $200 million  . The Company and   Momenta   will jointly be responsible for product development and will equally share in the costs and profits related to the products. Under the agreement, Mylan will lead the worldwide commercialization efforts.  
  On November 2, 2016, the Company and Momenta announced that dosing had begun in a Phase 1 study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834, a proposed bisoimilar or ORENCIA  (abatacept), to U.S. and

European Union sourced ORENCIA  in normal healthy volunteers. Under the agreement, Momenta has achieved the milestone necessary to earn a   $25 million   payment from the Company which will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  In accordance with   ASC 730, Research and Development  ,     the Company is accounting for the contingent milestone payments as non-refundable advance payments for services to be used in future R D activities, which are required to be capitalized until the related services have been performed. More specifically, as costs are incurred within the scope of the collaboration, the Company will record its share of the costs as R D expense. In addition to the upfront cash payment, during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   the Company incurred approximately   $9.0 million   and   $22.3 million  , respectively, of R D expense related to this collaboration. To the extent the contingent milestone payments made by the Company exceed the liability incurred, a prepaid asset will be reflected on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. To the extent the contingent milestone payments made by the Company are less than the expense incurred, the difference between the payment and the expense will be recorded as a liability on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
   
           5. 
    Share-Based Incentive Plan 
     The Company s shareholders have approved the   2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan   (as amended, the    2003 Plan   ).

    Earnings per Ordinary Share Attributable to   Mylan N.V.    
     Basic earnings per ordinary share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to   Mylan N.V.   ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per ordinary share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to   Mylan N.V.   ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding related to potentially dilutive securities or instruments, if the impact is dilutive.

On   August 5, 2016  , in conjunction with the Offer, the Company issued approximately   26.4 million   Mylan N.V. ordinary shares to Meda shareholders. The impact of the issuance of these ordinary shares is included in the calculation of basic earnings per share. The weighted average impact for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was   16.1 million   and   5.4 million   ordinary shares, respectively. 
  On September 15, 2008, concurrent with the sale of   $575 million   aggregate principal amount of Cash Convertible Notes due 2015 (the  Cash Convertible Notes ), Mylan Inc. entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with certain counterparties. In connection with the consummation of the EPD Transaction, the terms of the convertible note hedge were adjusted so that the cash settlement value would be based on Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. The terms of the warrant transactions were also adjusted so that, from and after the consummation of the EPD Transaction, the Company could settle the obligations under the warrant transactions by delivering Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. Pursuant to the warrant transactions, and a subsequent amendment in 2011, there were approximately   43.2 million   warrants outstanding, with approximately   41.0 million   of the warrants that had an exercise price of   $30.00  . The remaining warrants had an exercise price of   $20.00  . The warrants met the definition of derivatives under the FASB s guidance regarding accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities; however, because these instruments were determined to be indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares and met the criteria for equity classification under the FASB s guidance regarding contracts in an entity s own equity  ,   the warrants were recorded in shareholders  equity in the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  .   On April 15, 2016, in connection with the expiration and settlement of the warrants, the Company issued approximately 17.0 million Mylan N.V. ordinary shares.   The impact of the issuance of these ordinary shares is included in the calculation of basic earnings per share from the date of issuance. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   10.4 million   ordinary shares is the weighted average impact included in the calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share. The dilutive impact of the warrants, prior to settlement, is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share based upon the average market value of the Company s ordinary shares during the period as compared to the exercise price. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   6.6 million   warrants were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   20.3 million   and   22.1 million   warrants, respectively, were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share. 
  Basic and diluted (loss) earnings per ordinary share attributable to   Mylan N.V.   are calculated as follows: 

Additional stock awards and restricted stock awards were outstanding during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per ordinary share for each respective period because the effect would be anti-dilutive. Excluded shares at   September 30, 2016   include certain share-based compensation awards and restricted ordinary shares whose performance conditions had not been fully met. Such excluded

shares and anti-dilutive awards represented   13.9 million   shares and   7.3 million   shares for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   3.9 million   shares for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Inclusive of the impact from the acquisitions of Meda and the   Topicals Business  , amortization expense over the remainder of   2016   and for years ended   December 31, 2017   through   2020   is estimated to be as follows: 

11. 
    Financial Instruments and Risk Management 
     The Company is exposed to certain financial risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The primary financial risks that are managed by using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. 
  Foreign Currency Risk Management 
  In order to manage foreign currency risk, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate risk associated with changes in spot exchange rates of mainly non-functional currency denominated assets or liabilities. The foreign exchange forward contracts are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities on the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . Any gains or losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the period incurred in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  . 
  In order to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with the expected payment of the Swedish krona-denominated cash portion of the purchase price of the Offer, the Company entered into a series of non-designated foreign exchange forward and option contracts with a total notional amount of   45.2kr billion  . During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized losses of   $44.4 million   and   $128.6 million   for the changes in fair value related to these contracts which is included in   other expense, net   in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  . These contracts settled during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company has also entered into forward contracts to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated sales from certain international subsidiaries. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges to manage foreign currency transaction risk and are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities on the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . Any changes in fair value are included in earnings or deferred through accumulated other comprehensive earnings ( AOCE ), depending on the nature and effectiveness of the offset. Any ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedging relationship is recognized immediately in earnings in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  . 
  Following the acquisition of Meda, the Company designated certain Euro borrowings as a hedge of its investment in certain Euro-functional currency subsidiaries in order to manage foreign currency translation risk. The notional amount of the net investment hedges was    288 million   and consists primarily of Euro denominated debt which has a maturity date in   August 2017  . Borrowings designated as net investment hedges are marked to market using the current spot exchange rate as of the end

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued 

of the period, with gains and losses included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCE until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investments. The Company recorded   no   ineffectiveness from its net investment hedges for the three or   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Interest Rate Risk Management 
  The Company enters into interest rate swaps in order to manage interest rate risk associated with the Company s fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These derivative instruments are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities in the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  .  
  Cash Flow Hedging Relationships 
  The Company s interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges fix the interest rate on a portion of the Company s variable-rate debt or hedge part of the Company s interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates. Any changes in fair value are included in earnings or deferred through AOCE, depending on the nature and effectiveness of the offset. Any ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedging relationship is recognized immediately in earnings in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  .  
  Following the acquisition of Meda, the Company designated certain interest rate swaps with a notional amount of    750 million   as cash flow hedges. The maturity date of these swaps is   June 2017  .  
  In September 2015, the Company entered into a series of forward starting swaps to hedge against changes in interest rates related to future debt issuances. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of expected future issuances of long-term bonds. The Company executed   $500 million   of notional value swaps with an effective date of June 2016 and an additional   $500 million   of notional value swaps with an effective date of November 2016. Both sets of swaps had a maturity of   10 years  . As discussed further in Note   12     Debt  , during the second quarter of 2016, the Company issued   $2.25 billion   in an aggregate principal amount of   3.950%   Senior Notes due 2026 and the Company terminated these swaps. As a result of this termination, the Company recorded losses of   $64.9 million   in AOCE, which are being amortized over the life of the   3.950%   Senior Notes due 2026. In addition, during the second quarter of 2016, approximately   $2.1 million   of hedge ineffectiveness related to these forward starting swaps was recorded in interest expense on the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  .  
  Fair Value Hedging Relationships 
  The Company s interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges convert the fixed rate on a portion of the Company s fixed-rate senior notes to a variable rate. Any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments, as well as the offsetting change in fair value of the portion of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, is included in interest expense. 
  The Company regularly reviews the creditworthiness of its financial counterparties and does not expect to incur a significant loss from the failure of any counterparties to perform under any agreements. The Company is not subject to any obligations to post collateral under derivative instrument contracts. Certain derivative instrument contracts entered into by the Company are governed by master agreements, which contain credit-risk-related contingent features that would allow the counterparties to terminate the contracts early and request immediate payment should the Company trigger an event of default on other specified borrowings. The Company records all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets  . Accordingly, there are no offsetting amounts that net assets against liabilities.

Fair Value Measurement 
  Fair value is based on the price that would be received from the sale of an identical asset or paid to transfer an identical liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: 
             
    Level 1:   Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. 
                
    Level 2:   Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 3:   Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. 
     In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value.

For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including the LIBOR yield curve, foreign exchange forward prices and bank price quotes. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets and liabilities: 
             
    Cash equivalents     valued at observable net asset value prices. 
                
    Trading securities     valued at the active quoted market price from broker or dealer quotations or transparent pricing sources at the reporting date. 
                
    Available-for-sale fixed income investments     valued at the quoted market price from broker or dealer quotations or transparent pricing sources at the reporting date. 
                
    Available-for-sale equity securities     valued using quoted stock prices from public exchanges at the reporting date and translated to the U.S. Dollar at prevailing spot exchange rates, as applicable. 
                
    Interest rate swap derivative assets and liabilities     valued using the LIBOR/EURIBOR yield curves at the reporting date. Counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. 
                
    Foreign exchange derivative assets and liabilities     valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices and spot rates at the reporting date. Counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions.

The fair value measurement of contingent consideration is determined using Level 3 inputs. The Company s contingent consideration represents a component of the total purchase consideration for the respiratory delivery platform, the acquisition of   Agila  , the acquisition of Jai Pharma Limited, the acquisition of the   Topicals Business   and certain other acquisitions. The measurement is calculated using unobservable inputs based on the Company s own assumptions. For the respiratory delivery platform, Jai Pharma Limited and certain other acquisitions, significant unobservable inputs in the valuation include the probability and timing of future development and commercial milestones and future profit sharing payments. A discounted cash flow method was used to value contingent consideration at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which was calculated as the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using a market rate of return. Discount rates ranging from   1.4%   to   9.8%   were utilized in the valuations. For the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of   Agila   and the acquisition of the   Topicals Business  , significant unobservable inputs in the valuation include the probability of future payments to the seller of amounts withheld at the closing date. Significant changes in unobservable inputs could result in material changes to the contingent consideration liability. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , accretion of   $10.4 million   and   $30.7 million  , respectively, was recorded in interest expense in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  . During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , accretion of   $9.7 million   and   $28.5 million  , respectively, was recorded in interest expense in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  . 
  Although the Company has not elected the fair value option for other financial assets and liabilities, any future transacted financial asset or liability will be evaluated for the fair value election.

  The MTN program contains covenants that, among other things, restrict Meda's ability and the ability of certain of Meda's subsidiaries to substantially change the general nature of its business; create liens to secure debt securities or other publicly traded debt; or sell or dispose of Meda's assets to the extent such sales or disposition could jeopardize Meda s ability to fulfill its obligations under the MTN program; and require Meda to maintain the listing of the loans under the MTN program on Nasdaq Stockholm. As long as the loans under the MTN program are listed on Nasdaq Stockholm, Meda is required to comply with certain Nasdaq Stockholm financial reporting requirements. The MTN program also provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include nonpayment, breach of covenants, payment defaults or acceleration of other indebtedness, failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. These covenants and events of default are subject to a number of important qualifications, limitations and exceptions that are described in the general terms and conditions of the MTN program. If an event of default with respect to the loans under the MTN program occurs, the principal amount of all of the loans under the MTN program then outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of acceleration, may become immediately due and payable.

On   August 5, 2016  , in conjunction with the Offer, the Company issued approximately   26.4 million   Mylan N.V. ordinary shares to Meda shareholders. On February 27, 2015, as part of the EPD Transaction, the Company acquired the EPD Business from Abbott Laboratories in exchange for   110 million   ordinary shares of Mylan N.V.  
  On   April 3, 2015  , the Company and Stichting Preferred Shares Mylan (the  Foundation ) entered into a call option agreement (the  Call Option Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Call Option Agreement,   Mylan N.V.   granted the Foundation a call option (the  Option ), permitting the Foundation to acquire from time-to-time   Mylan N.V.   preferred shares up to a maximum number equal to the total number of   Mylan N.V.   ordinary shares issued at such time to the extent such shares are not held by the Foundation. In response to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. s ( Teva ) unsolicited expression of interest to acquire Mylan on July 23, 2015, the Foundation exercised the Option and acquired   488,388,431   Mylan preferred shares pursuant to the terms of the Call Option Agreement. Each Mylan ordinary share and preferred share was entitled to   one vote   on each matter properly brought before a general meeting of shareholders. On July 27, 2015, Teva announced its entry into an agreement to acquire the Generic Drug Unit of Allergan plc and the withdrawal of its unsolicited, non-binding expression of interest to acquire Mylan. On September 19, 2015, the Foundation requested the redemption of the Mylan preferred shares issued. Mylan ordinary shareholders approved the redemption of the preferred shares on January 7, 2016 at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders and on March 17, 2016, the redemption of the Mylan preferred shares became effective. The Foundation will continue to have the right to exercise the Option in the future in response to a new threat to the interests of Mylan, its businesses and its stakeholders from time to time. 
  With effect from February 27, 2015, the general meeting authorized the board to repurchase Company shares for a maximum period of   18 months  , with such authorization expiring on August 27, 2016 (the  Share Repurchase Authorization ). More specifically, the general meeting authorized the board to repurchase the maximum number of ordinary shares allowed under Dutch law and applicable securities regulations on the NASDAQ for a period of   18 months  . On June 24, 2016, at the annual general meeting, the Company s shareholders approved an extension of the Share Repurchase Authorization, which will now expire on   December 24, 2017  . On July 27, 2016, the board approved the commensurate extension of the Share Repurchase Program (as defined below). 
  On   November 16, 2015  , the Company announced that its board of directors approved the repurchase of up to   $1.0 billion   of the Company s ordinary shares either in the open market through privately-negotiated transactions or in one of more self tender offers (the  Share Repurchase Program ). At   September 30, 2016  , the Share Repurchase Program has approximately   $932.5 million   remaining for ordinary share repurchases. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of ordinary shares.

    Segment Information 
     The Company has   two   segments,  Generics  and  Specialty.  The Generics segment primarily develops, manufactures, sells and distributes generic or branded generic pharmaceutical products in tablet, capsule, injectable, transdermal patch, gel, cream or ointment form, as well as active pharmaceutical ingredients ( API ). The Specialty segment

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued 

engages mainly in the development and sale of branded specialty nebulized and injectable products. Meda operations have been included in the Generics segment for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer, who evaluates the performance of the Company s segments based on total revenues and segment profitability. Segment profitability represents segment gross profit less direct R D expenses and direct SG A. Certain general and administrative and R D expenses not allocated to the segments, net charges for litigation settlements, impairment charges and other expenses not directly attributable to the segments, are reported in Corporate/Other. Additionally, amortization of intangible assets and other purchase accounting related items, as well as any other significant special items, are included in Corporate/Other. Items below the earnings from operations line on the Company s   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations   are not presented by segment, since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability. The Company does not report depreciation expense, total assets and capital expenditures by segment, as such information is not used by the chief operating decision maker.  
  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  included in   Mylan N.V.   s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as amended. Intersegment revenues are accounted for at current market values and are eliminated at the consolidated level. 
  Due to our acquisition of Meda on August 5, 2016 and the integration of our portfolio across our branded, generics and OTC platforms in all of our regions, effective October 1, 2016, the Company is expanding its reportable segments. The Company will report its results in three segments on a geographic basis as follows: (1) North America, (2) Europe and (3) Rest of World. This change in segment reporting will begin with the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2016. Comparative segment financial information will be recast for prior periods to conform to this revised segment structure. Identifiable intangible assets and goodwill previously allocated to the Generics and Specialty Segments will be reallocated to the new segments. The Company s measure of segment profitability will remain unchanged.  
  Presented in the table below is segment information for the periods identified and a reconciliation of segment information to total consolidated information.

The Company computes its provision for income taxes using an estimated effective tax rate for the full year with consideration of certain discrete tax items which occurred within the interim period. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received approvals from the relevant Indian regulatory authorities to legally merge its wholly owned subsidiary,   Jai Pharma Limited  , into   Mylan Laboratories Limited  . The merger resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of   $150 million   for the tax deductible goodwill in excess of the book goodwill with a corresponding benefit to income tax provision for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . In addition to the benefit recognized for the merger of the aforementioned entities, the effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   versus the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was also impacted by the   Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement  . 
   
   Legal Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inquiries and proceedings and litigation matters that arise from time to time, some of which are described below. The Company is also party to certain litigation matters including those for which Merck KGaA or Strides Arcolab has agreed to indemnify the Company, pursuant to the respective sale and purchase agreements. 
  While the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses with respect to the claims asserted against it and intends to vigorously defend its position, the process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate resolution of any such proceeding. It is possible that an unfavorable resolution of any of the matters described below, or the inability or denial of Merck KGaA,   Strides Arcolab  , or another indemnitor or insurer to pay an indemnified claim, could have a material effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or ordinary share price. Unless otherwise disclosed below, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the respective litigation or to provide an estimate of the range of reasonably possible losses. Legal costs are recorded as incurred and are classified in SG A in the Company s   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  . 
  Lorazepam and Clorazepate 
  On June 1, 2005, a jury verdict was rendered against Mylan, MPI, and co-defendants Cambrex Corporation and Gyma Laboratories in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in the amount of approximately   $12.0 million  , which has been accrued for by the Company. The jury found that Mylan and its co-defendants willfully violated Massachusetts, Minnesota and Illinois state antitrust laws in connection with API supply agreements entered into between the Company and its API supplier (Cambrex) and broker (Gyma) for   two   drugs, Lorazepam and Clorazepate, in 1997, and subsequent price increases on these drugs in 1998. The case was brought by   four   health insurers who opted out of earlier class action settlements agreed to by the Company in 2001 and represents the last remaining antitrust claims relating to Mylan s 1998 price increases for Lorazepam and Clorazepate. Following the verdict, the Company filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, a motion for a new trial, a motion to dismiss   two   of the insurers and a motion to reduce the verdict. On December 20, 2006, the Company s motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial were denied and the remaining motions were denied on January 24, 2008. In post-trial filings, the plaintiffs requested that the verdict be trebled and that request was granted on January 24, 2008. On February 6, 2008, a judgment was issued against Mylan and its co-defendants in the total amount of approximately   $69.0 million  , which, in the case of   three   of the plaintiffs, reflects trebling of the compensatory damages in the original verdict (approximately   $11.0 million   in total) and, in the case of the fourth plaintiff, reflects their amount of the compensatory damages in the original jury verdict plus doubling this compensatory damage award as punitive damages assessed against each of the defendants (approximately   $58.0 million   in total), some or all of which may be subject to indemnification obligations by Mylan. Plaintiffs are also seeking an award of attorneys  fees and litigation costs in unspecified amounts and prejudgment interest of approximately   $8.0 million  . The Company and its co-defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and have challenged the verdict as legally erroneous on multiple grounds. The appeals were held in abeyance pending a ruling on the motion for prejudgment interest, which has been granted. Mylan has contested this ruling along with the liability finding and other damages awards as part of its appeal, which was filed in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On January 18, 2011, the Court of Appeals issued a judgment remanding the case to the District Court for further proceedings based on lack of diversity with respect to certain plaintiffs. On June 13, 2011, Mylan filed a certiorari petition with the U.S. Supreme Court requesting review of the judgment of the D.C. Circuit. On October 3, 2011, the certiorari petition was denied. The case is now proceeding before the District Court. On January 14, 2013, following limited court-ordered jurisdictional discovery, the plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint containing additional factual averments with respect to the diversity

of citizenship of the parties, along with a motion to voluntarily dismiss   775   (of   1,387  ) self-funded customers whose presence would destroy the District Court s diversity jurisdiction. The plaintiffs also moved for a remittitur (reduction) of approximately   $8.1 million   from the full damages award. Mylan s brief in response to the new factual averments in the complaint was filed on February 13, 2013. On July 29, 2014, the court granted both plaintiffs  motion to amend the complaint and their motion to dismiss   775   self-funded customers. 
  In connection with the Company s appeal of the judgment, the Company submitted a surety bond underwritten by a third-party insurance company in the amount of   $74.5 million   in February 2008. On May 30, 2012, the District Court ordered the amount of the surety bond reduced to   $66.6 million  . 
  Pricing and Medicaid Litigation 
  Dey L.P. (now known as Mylan Specialty L.P. and herein as    Mylan Specialty   ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was named as a defendant in several class actions brought by consumers and third-party payors. Mylan Specialty reached a settlement of these class actions, which was approved by the court and all claims have been dismissed. Additionally, a complaint was filed under seal by a plaintiff on behalf of the United States of America against   Mylan Specialty   in August 1997. In August 2006, the Government filed its complaint-in-intervention and the case was unsealed in September 2006. The Government asserted that   Mylan Specialty   was jointly liable with a co-defendant and sought recovery of alleged overpayments, together with treble damages, civil penalties and equitable relief.   Mylan Specialty   completed a settlement of this action in December 2010. These cases all have generally alleged that   Mylan Specialty   falsely reported certain price information concerning certain drugs marketed by   Mylan Specialty  , that   Mylan Specialty   caused false claims to be made to Medicaid and to Medicare, and that Mylan Specialty caused Medicaid and Medicare to make overpayments on those claims. 
    
  Under the terms of the purchase agreement with Merck KGaA, Mylan is fully indemnified for the claims in the preceding paragraph and Merck KGaA is entitled to any income tax benefit the Company realizes for any deductions of amounts paid for such pricing litigation. Under the indemnity, Merck KGaA is responsible for all settlement and legal costs, and, as such, these settlements had no impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has accrued approximately   $63.3 million   in other current liabilities, which represents its estimate of the remaining amount of anticipated income tax benefits due to Merck KGaA. We are not aware of any outstanding claims related to Merck KGaA.  
    
  Modafinil Antitrust Litigation and FTC Inquiry 
  Beginning in April 2006, Mylan and   four   other drug manufacturers have been named as defendants in civil lawsuits filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by a variety of plaintiffs purportedly representing direct and indirect purchasers of the drug modafinil and in a lawsuit filed by Apotex, Inc., a manufacturer of generic drugs. These actions allege violations of federal antitrust and state laws in connection with the generic defendants  settlement of patent litigation with Cephalon relating to modafinil. Discovery has closed. On June 23, 2014, the court granted the defendants  motion for partial summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs  claims that the defendants had engaged in an overall conspiracy to restrain trade (and denied the corresponding plaintiffs  motion). On January 28, 2015, the District Court denied the defendants  summary judgment motions based on factors identified in the Supreme Court s   Actavis   decision. In an order of June 1, 2015, vacated and reissued on June 11, 2015, the District Court denied the indirect purchaser plaintiffs  motion for class certification. The indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed a petition for leave to appeal the certification decision, which was denied by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on December 21, 2015. On July 27, 2015, the District Court granted the direct purchaser plaintiffs  motion for class certification. On October 9, 2015, the Third Circuit granted defendants  petition for leave to appeal the class certification decision. On October 16, 2015, defendants filed a motion to stay the liability trial, which had been set to begin on February 2, 2016, with the District Court pending the appeal of the decision to certify the direct purchaser class; this motion was denied on December 17, 2015. On December 17, 2015, the District Court approved the form and manner of notice to the certified class of direct purchasers; the notice was subsequently issued to the class. On December 21, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to stay with the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which was granted on January 25, 2016; the trial is now stayed and the case has been placed in suspense. The appeal was fully briefed on April 28, 2016. Oral arguments on the appeal took place on July 12, 2016. On September 13, 2016, the Third Circuit reversed the district court s certification order and remanded for further proceedings. On October 14, 2016 direct purchaser plaintiffs filed a petition seeking rehearing. On October 31, 2016 the petition seeking rehearing was denied. On March 24, 2015, Mylan reached a settlement in principle with the putative indirect purchasers, and on November 20, 2015, Mylan entered into a settlement agreement with the putative indirect purchasers. Plaintiffs have not yet moved for preliminary approval of that settlement. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has accrued approximately   $16.0 million   related to this settlement.

  MYLAN N.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued 

On June 29, 2015, the City of Providence, Rhode Island filed suit in the District of Rhode Island against the same parties named as defendants in litigation pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, including Mylan, asserting state law claims based on the same underlying allegations. All defendants, including Mylan, moved to dismiss the suit on October 15, 2015 and the case was subsequently settled.  
  On July 10, 2015, the Louisiana Attorney General filed in the 19th Judicial District Court in Louisiana a petition against Mylan and   three   other drug manufacturers asserting state law claims based on the same underlying allegations as those made in litigation pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The petition was filed by the State of Louisiana purportedly in its capacity as an indirect purchaser. On May 16, 2016, the Judicial District Court deferred Mylan s declinatory exception of no personal jurisdiction and its peremptory exception of prescription, and granted in part and denied in part Mylan s peremptory exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action. On June 30, 2016, the plaintiff filed a supplemental and amended petition. The defendants filed a motion to strike and joint peremptory exceptions to the amended petition, which remain pending. On July 21, 2016, the plaintiff filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeal its application for a supervisory writ regarding the granting of defendant s exceptions, which the defendants have opposed. The appeal was denied on October 31, 2016. On April 20, 2016, the State of Louisiana filed a motion to consolidate the pending action with   four   other actions against other pharmaceutical manufacturers concerning products not related to modafinil, which Mylan opposed. On June 27, 2016, the Judicial Court declined to consolidate Mylan s case with the other   four   actions, with leave to renew the consolidation request after filing the above-referenced amended petition. On July 21, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion to reurge consolidation. Subsequently, the action to which plaintiff seeks to join Mylan was stayed, resulting in a stay of consolidation motion. 
  On July 28, 2016, United Healthcare filed a complaint against Mylan and   four   other drug manufacturers in the United States District of Minnesota, asserting state law claims based on the same underlying allegations as those made in litigation pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Mylan s response deadline is November 30, 2016. 
  In addition, by letter dated July 11, 2006, Mylan was notified by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) of an investigation relating to the settlement of the modafinil patent litigation. In its letter, the FTC requested certain information from Mylan, MPI and Mylan Technologies, Inc. pertaining to the patent litigation and the settlement thereof. On March 29, 2007, the FTC issued a subpoena, and on April 26, 2007, the FTC issued a civil investigative demand to Mylan, requesting additional information from the Company relating to the investigation. Mylan has cooperated fully with the government s investigation and completed all requests for information. On February 13, 2008, the FTC filed a lawsuit against Cephalon in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and the case was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On July 1, 2010, the FTC issued a third party subpoena to Mylan, requesting documents in connection with its lawsuit against Cephalon. Mylan has responded to the subpoena. The lawsuit against Cephalon settled and a Stipulated Order for Permanent Injunction and Equitable Monetary Relief was entered by the Court on June 17, 2015. 
  Pioglitazone 
  Beginning in December 2013, Mylan, Takeda, and several other drug manufacturers have been named as defendants in civil lawsuits consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by plaintiffs which purport to represent indirect purchasers of branded or generic Actos  and Actoplus Met . These actions allege violations of state and federal competition laws in connection with the defendants  settlements of patent litigation in 2010 relating to Actos and Actoplus Met . Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August 22, 2014. Mylan and the other defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint on October 10, 2014.   Two   additional complaints were subsequently filed by plaintiffs purporting to represent classes of direct purchasers of branded or generic Actos  and Actoplus Met . On September 23, 2015, the District Court granted defendants  motions to dismiss the indirect purchasers amended complaints with prejudice. The indirect purchasers filed a notice of appeal on October 22, 2015; however they have since abandoned and dismissed their appeal of the District Court s dismissal of claims asserted against Mylan. The putative direct purchaser class filed an amended complaint on January 8, 2016. Defendants  motion to dismiss was filed on January 28, 2016 and the briefing has been completed. The case has been stayed pending the resolution of the indirect purchasers  appeal against the defendants remaining in that case.  
  Shareholders Class Action 
  On June 11, 2015, City of Riviera Beach General Employees Retirement System and Doris Arnold (collectively, the  plaintiffs ) filed a purported class action complaint against Mylan and directors of Mylan Inc. (the  Directors ) in the Washington County, Pennsylvania, Court of Common Pleas (the  Pennsylvania Court ), on behalf of certain former shareholders of Mylan Inc. The complaint alleged both breach of fiduciary duty by the Directors and breach of contract by  
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  
  MYLAN N.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued 

Mylan and the Directors, relating to certain public disclosures made in connection with the   EPD Transaction   and the organization of, and Call Option Agreement with, the Foundation. The plaintiffs asked the Pennsylvania Court to: find that the Directors breached their fiduciary duties and that Mylan and the Directors breached the purported contract, rescind the vote of Mylan Inc. s former shareholders approving the   EPD Transaction  , award compensatory damages and award Plaintiffs their costs relating to the lawsuit. On June 22, 2015, Mylan and the Directors removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (the  District Court ). The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the District Court on July 10, 2015, that included the same basic causes of action and requested relief, dropped allegations against some of the Directors named in the original complaint and asserted the breach of contract claim not on behalf of a purported class of former shareholders of Mylan Inc. but on behalf of a purported subclass of such shareholders who held shares of Mylan continuously for a specified period following consummation of the   EPD Transaction  . On July 21, 2015, a second purported class action complaint against the same defendants, asserting the same basic claims and requesting the same basic relief on behalf of the same purported class and subclass, was filed by a different plaintiff in the District Court. On August 28, 2015, the District Court consolidated the   three   actions, and, on September 4, 2015, the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed a consolidated amended complaint (the  Consolidated Amended Complaint ) against the same defendants, asserting the same basic claims and requesting the same basic relief on behalf of the same purported class and subclass, but asserting the breach of contract claim against only Mylan. On September 30, 2015,   two   of the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed a motion for partial summary judgment, on the breach of contract claim against Mylan (the  Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ). On October 23, 2015, the District Court approved the voluntary dismissal of a third purported class action, commenced on August 28, 2015 against Mylan and the Directors, alleging federal securities and breach of contract claims against all defendants and breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Directors, all arising out of the same basic alleged facts and requesting the same basic relief on behalf of certain former shareholders of Mylan Inc. On November 25, 2015, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint, and Mylan filed an Opposition to the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and a Motion to Deny Summary Judgment. On December 21, 2015, the District Court consolidated the action with a fourth purported class action, commenced on November 24, 2015 by, among others, the plaintiff in the third action, against the same defendants, alleging only breach of contract arising out of the same basic alleged facts, and requesting the same basic relief on behalf of certain former shareholders of Mylan Inc. In consolidating the actions, the District Court ordered, among other things, that the Consolidated Amended Complaint would remain the operative complaint in the consolidated action and that the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Motion to Dismiss were not disturbed by the consolidation. A Report and Recommendation was issued by the Magistrate Judge on May 10, 2016, recommending to the District Court that the defendants  Motion to Dismiss the plaintiffs  Consolidated Amended Complaint be granted and that the case be dismissed with prejudice. The Magistrate Judge further recommended that the District Court deny the plaintiffs  Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as moot. Briefing on the plaintiffs  objections to the Report and Recommendation was completed on June 7, 2016. The District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge on August 12, 2016, dismissing the case with prejudice.  
  SEC Investigation 
  On September 10, 2015, Mylan N.V. received a subpoena from the SEC seeking documents with regard to certain related party matters. Mylan is cooperating with the SEC in its investigation, and we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter at this time. 
  MDRP Classification of   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   and   EpiPen Jr  Auto-Injector    
  In November 2014, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) related to the classification of the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The Company complied with various information requests received from the DOJ pursuant to the subpoena. The question in the underlying matter was whether   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   was properly classified with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services ( CMS ) as a non-innovator drug under the applicable definition in the Medicaid Rebate statute and subject to the formula that is used to calculate rebates to Medicaid for such drugs.   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   has been classified with CMS as a non-innovator drug since before Mylan acquired the product in 2007 based on longstanding written guidance from the federal government. Beginning in August 2016, questions regarding the pricing of the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   significantly increased and the Company received additional inquiries, including with respect to the classification of   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, from committees and members of Congress and from other federal and state governmental agencies. 
  Subsequent to these developments, on October 7, 2016, Mylan agreed to the terms of a   $465 million   settlement with the DOJ and other government agencies related to the classification of the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The terms of the settlement do not provide for any finding of wrongdoing on the part of Mylan Inc. or  
  
   56 

     Table of Contents  
  MYLAN N.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued 

any of its affiliated entities or personnel. The settlement terms provide for resolution of all potential Medicaid rebate liability claims by federal and state governments as to whether the product should have been classified as an innovator drug for CMS purposes, and subject to a higher rebate formula.   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   will begin being classified as an innovator drug on April 1, 2017. In connection with the settlement, Mylan expects to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mylan continues to work with the government to finalize the settlement. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded an accrual of   $465 million   related to the DOJ settlement which is included in other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  SEC Document Request  
  On October 7, 2016, Mylan received a document request from the Division of Enforcement at the SEC seeking communications with the CMS and documents concerning Mylan products sold and related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and any related complaints. Mylan intends to fully cooperate with the SEC s inquiry. 
  EpiPen  Auto-Injector   Federal Securities Litigation 
  Purported class action complaints were filed in October 2016 against Mylan N.V., Mylan Inc. and certain of their directors and officers (collectively, for purposes of this paragraph, the  defendants ) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of certain purchasers of securities of Mylan N.V. and/or Mylan Inc. The complaints allege that defendants made false or misleading statements and omissions of purportedly material fact, in violation of federal securities laws, in connection with disclosures relating to Mylan N.V. and Mylan Inc. s classification of their   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   as a non-innovator drug for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The complaints seek damages, as well as the plaintiffs  fees and costs. We believe that the claims in these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. 
  EpiPen  Auto-Injector   Israeli Securities Litigation 
  On October 13, 2016, a purported shareholder of Mylan N.V. filed a lawsuit, together with a motion to certify the lawsuit as a class action on behalf of certain Mylan N.V. shareholders, against Mylan N.V. and four of its officers (collectively, for purposes of this paragraph, the  defendants ) in the Tel Aviv District Court (Economic Division). The plaintiff alleges that the defendants made false or misleading statements and omissions of purportedly material fact in Mylan N.V. s reports to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange regarding Mylan N.V. s classification of its   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, in violation of both U.S. and Israeli securities laws, the Israeli Companies Law and the Israeli Torts Ordinance. The plaintiff seeks damages, among other remedies. We believe that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. 
  EpiPen  Auto-Injector   Civil Litigation 
  Beginning in August 2016, Mylan Specialty L.P. and other Mylan-affiliated entities have been named as defendants in certain putative class action lawsuits relating to the pricing and/or marketing of the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector  . The plaintiffs in these suits assert violations of various state consumer protection laws, as well as common law claims, including claims for unjust enrichment, restitution, disgorgement and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiffs  claims include purported challenges to the prices charged for the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   and/or the marketing of the product in packages containing two auto-injectors. We believe that the claims in these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. 
  EpiPen  Auto-Injector   State AG Investigations 
  Beginning in August 2016, the Company and certain of its affiliated entities received subpoenas and informal requests from various state attorneys general seeking information and documents relating to the pricing and/or marketing of the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector  . The Company is cooperating with these inquiries. 
  EpiPen  Auto-Injector   U.S. Congress/State Requests for Information and Documents 
  Mylan has also received several requests for information and documents from various Committees of the U.S. Congress and federal and state lawmakers concerning the marketing, distribution and sales of Mylan products. Mylan intends to engage with federal and state lawmakers as appropriate in response to their requests.

The Company believes that it has strong defenses to current and future potential civil litigation, as well as governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings, although it is reasonably possible that the Company may incur additional losses from these matters, the amount of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. In addition, the Company expects to incur additional legal and other professional service expenses associated with the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   pricing matters in future periods and will recognize these expenses as services are received. The Company believes that the ultimate amount paid for these services and claims could have a material effect on the Company's business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or ordinary share price in future periods. 
  Drug Pricing Matters  
  Department of Justice/Connecticut     Subpoenas 
  On December 3, 2015, a subsidiary of Mylan N.V. received a subpoena from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. DOJ seeking information relating to the marketing, pricing, and sale of our generic Doxycycline products and any communications with competitors about such products.  
  On September 8, 2016, a subsidiary of Mylan N.V., as well as certain employees and a member of senior management, received subpoenas from the DOJ seeking additional information relating to the marketing, pricing and sale of our generic Cidofovir, Glipizide-metformin, Propranolol and Verapamil products and any communications with competitors about such products. Related search warrants also were executed. The Company is fully cooperating with the DOJ s inquiry. 
  On December 21, 2015, the Company received a subpoena and interrogatories from the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General seeking information relating to the marketing, pricing and sale of certain of the Company s generic products (including Doxycycline) and communications with competitors about such products. The Company is fully cooperating with Connecticut s inquiry. 
  United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and Rhode Island Litigation 
  Beginning in March 2016,   sixteen   putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and   one   filed in the District of Rhode Island by indirect purchasers against Mylan Inc., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and other pharmaceutical manufacturers, alleging conspiracies to fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the prices of certain Doxycycline and Digoxin products and to allocate markets and customers for those products. In addition,   three   putative class action complaints have been filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by direct purchasers against Mylan and other pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has established an MDL in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where the cases have been consolidated. Mylan and its subsidiary intend to deny liability and to defend these actions vigorously. 
  On September 21, 2016, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by indirect purchasers against Mylan Inc. and other pharmaceutical manufacturers, alleging conspiracies to fix, maintain, and/or stabilize the price of certain Pravastatin products. Mylan intends to deny liability and to defend this action vigorously. 
  European Commission Proceedings 
  Perindopril 
  On or around July 8, 2009, the European Commission (the  Commission ) stated that it had initiated antitrust proceedings pursuant to Article 11(6) of Regulation No. 1/2003 and Article 2(1) of Regulation No. 773/2004 to explore possible infringement of Articles 81 and 82 EC and Articles 53 and 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement by Les Laboratoires Servier ( Servier ) as well as possible infringement of Article 81 EC by the Company s Indian subsidiary,   Mylan Laboratories Limited  , and   four   other companies, each of which entered into agreements with Servier relating to the product Perindopril. On July 30, 2012, the Commission issued a Statement of Objections to Servier SAS, Servier Laboratories Limited, Les Laboratories Servier, Adir, Biogaran, Krka, d.d. Novo mesto, Lupin Limited,   Mylan Laboratories Limited  , Mylan, Niche Generics Limited, Teva UK Limited, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Teva Pharmaceuticals Europe B.V. and Unichem Laboratories Limited.

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued 

Laboratories Limited   approximately    17.2 million  , including approximately    8.0 million   jointly and severally with Mylan Inc. The Company paid approximately   $21.7 million   related to this matter during the fourth quarter of 2014. In September 2014, the Company filed an appeal of the Commission s decision to the General Court of the European Union. The briefing on appeal is complete and we are awaiting the scheduling of the hearing date.  
  Citalopram 
  On March 19, 2010, Mylan and   Generics [U.K.] Limited  , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, received notice that the Commission had opened proceedings against Lundbeck with respect to alleged unilateral practices and/or agreements related to Citalopram in the European Economic Area. On July 25, 2012 a Statement of Objections was issued to Lundbeck, Merck KGaA,   Generics [U.K.] Limited  , Arrow, Resolution Chemicals, Xelia Pharmaceuticals, Alpharma, A.L. Industrier and Ranbaxy.   Generics [U.K.] Limited   filed a response to the Statement of Objections and vigorously defended itself against allegations contained therein. On June 19, 2013, the Commission issued a decision finding that   Generics [U.K.] Limited  , as well as the companies noted above, had violated European Union competition rules and fined   Generics [U.K.] Limited   approximately    7.8 million  , jointly and severally with Merck KGaA.   Generics [U.K.] Limited   has appealed the Commission s decision to the General Court of the EU. Briefing on the appeal has been completed and a hearing took place on October 8, 2015. On September 8, 2016, the General Court dismissed all appeals against the European Commission s decision. Mylan has until November 18, 2016 to appeal the decision to European Court of Justice. The Company has accrued approximately   $8.6 million   and   $9.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, related to this matter. It is reasonably possible that we will incur additional losses above the amount accrued but we cannot estimate a range of such reasonably possible losses at this time. There are no assurances, however, that settlements reached and/or adverse judgments received, if any, will not exceed amounts accrued.   Generics [U.K.] Limited   has also sought indemnification from Merck KGaA with respect to the    7.8 million   portion of the fine for which Merck KGaA and   Generics [U.K.] Limited   were held jointly and severally liable. Merck KGaA has counterclaimed against   Generics [U.K.] Limited   seeking the same indemnification. 
  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority 
  Paroxetine 
  On August 12, 2011,   Generics [U.K.] Limited   received notice that the Office of Fair Trading (subsequently changed to the Competition and Markets Authority (the  CMA )) was opening an investigation to explore the possible infringement of the Competition Act 1998 and Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, with respect to alleged agreements related to Paroxetine. On April 19, 2013, a Statement of Objections was issued to Beecham Group plc, GlaxoSmithKline UK Limited, GlaxoSmithKline plc and SmithKline Beecham Limited (formerly, SmithKline Beecham plc) (together,  GlaxoSmithKline ),   Generics [U.K.] Limited  , Merck KGaA, Actavis UK Limited (formerly, Alpharma Limited), Xellia Pharmaceuticals ApS (formerly, Alpharma ApS) and Alpharma LLC (formerly, Zoetis Products LLC, Alpharma LLC, and Alpharma Inc.) (together,  Alpharma ), and Ivax LLC (formerly, Ivax Corporation) and Norton Healthcare Limited (which previously traded as Ivax Pharmaceuticals UK) (together,  Ivax ).   Generics [U.K.] Limited   filed a response to the Statement of Objections, defending itself against the allegations contained therein. The CMA issued a Supplementary Statement of Objections ( SSO ) to the above-referenced parties on October 21, 2014 and a hearing with regard to the SSO took place on December 19, 2014. The CMA issued a decision on February 12, 2016, finding that GlaxoSmithKline,   Generics [U.K.] Limited  , Merck KGaA and Alpharma, were liable for infringing EU and U.K. competition rules. With respect to Merck KGaA and   Generics [U.K.] Limited  , the CMA issued a penalty of approximately    5.8 million  , for which Merck KGaA is liable for the entire amount; and of that amount   Generics [U.K.] Limited   is jointly and severally liable for approximately    2.7 million  , which was accrued for at   September 30, 2016  .   Generics [U.K.] Limited   has appealed the decision. A hearing is scheduled to commence on February 27, 2017 before the Competition Appeals Tribunal. 
  Strides Arcolab Limited Settlement 
  At the acquisition date of Agila, the Company estimated and accrued approximately   $20 million   for contingent consideration related to certain escrow arrangements. On November 1, 2016, the Company and Strides agreed on a settlement of substantially all outstanding regulatory, warranty and indemnity claims (the  Strides Settlement ). As a result of the settlement, the Company will have access to approximately   $80 million   of cash in the fourth quarter of 2016 which is currently contingently restricted. Approximately   $110 million   will be paid to either settle these pre-acquisition claims or be remitted to Strides. As such, the Company recorded approximately   $90 million   of expense in the third quarter of 2016. This amount is included in litigation settlements and other contingencies, net in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Prior to the Strides Settlement, the maximum contingent consideration

remaining was approximately   $173 million   and was related to the satisfaction of certain regulatory conditions, including potential regulatory remediation costs and the resolution of certain pre-acquisition contingencies.  
  Product Liability 
  The Company is involved in a number of product liability lawsuits and claims related to alleged personal injuries arising out of certain products manufactured and/or distributed by the Company, including but not limited to its Fentanyl Transdermal System, Phenytoin, Propoxyphene, Alendronate and Metoclopramide. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and claims and is vigorously defending itself with respect to those matters. From time to time, the Company has agreed to settle or otherwise resolve certain lawsuits and claims on terms and conditions that are in the best interests of the Company. The Company has accrued approximately   $32.5 million   and   $9.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. It is reasonably possible that we will incur additional losses and fees above the amount accrued but we cannot estimate a range of such reasonably possible losses or legal fees related to these claims at this time. There are no assurances, however, that settlements reached and/or adverse judgments received, if any, will not exceed amounts accrued.  
    
  Intellectual Property 
  In certain situations, the Company has used its business judgment to decide to market and sell products, notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent infringement(s) or other potential third party rights have not been finally resolved by the courts. The risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement may include, a reasonable royalty on sales or damages measured by the profits lost by the patent owner. If there is a finding of willful infringement, damages may be increased up to   three   times. Moreover, because of the discount pricing typically involved with bioequivalent products, patented branded products generally realize a substantially higher profit margin than bioequivalent products. An adverse decision could have an adverse effect that is material to our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or ordinary share price.  
    
  Other Litigation 
  The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings that are considered normal to its business, including but not limited to certain proceedings assumed as a result of the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business, Agila and the   EPD Business  . The Company has approximately   $10 million   accrued related to these various other legal proceedings. While it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such other proceedings, the ultimate outcome of any such proceeding is not currently expected to be material to the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or ordinary share price.

  Executive Overview 
  Mylan is a leading global pharmaceutical company, which develops, licenses, manufactures, markets and distributes generic, branded generic and specialty pharmaceuticals. Mylan is committed to setting new standards in healthcare by creating better health for a better world, and our mission is to provide the world s   7 billion   people access to high quality medicine. To do so, we innovate to satisfy unmet needs; make reliability and service excellence a habit; do what s right, not what s easy; and impact the future through passionate global leadership.  
  Mylan offers one of the industry s broadest product portfolios, including   more than     2,700   marketed products, to customers in   more than     165   countries and territories. We operate a global, high quality vertically-integrated manufacturing platform, which includes   more than     50   manufacturing and research and development ( R D ) facilities around the world and one of the world s largest active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) operations. We also operate a strong R D network that has consistently delivered a robust product pipeline. Additionally, Mylan has a specialty business that is focused on respiratory and allergy therapies. 
  Through the third quarter of 2016, Mylan had   two   segments,  Generics  and  Specialty.  Generics primarily develops, manufactures, sells and distributes generic or branded generic pharmaceutical products in tablet, capsule, injectable or transdermal patch form, as well as API. Our generic pharmaceutical business is conducted primarily in the United States ( U.S. ), Canada and Brazil (collectively,  North America  Europe; and India, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as well as our export activity into emerging markets (collectively,  Rest of World ). Beginning in 2016, revenue from the Company s Brazilian operation is included in the North America region. All prior period revenue from the Company s Brazilian operations has been recast from the Rest of World region to the North America region to conform to the presentation for the current period. This change had no impact on Mylan s segment reporting. Our API business is conducted through Mylan Laboratories Limited, which is included within Rest of World in our Generics segment. Specialty engages mainly in the development and sale of branded specialty injectable and nebulized products. We also report in Corporate/Other certain R D expenses, general and administrative expenses, litigation settlements, amortization of intangible assets and certain purchase accounting items, impairment charges, if any, and other items not directly attributable to the segments. 
   Due to our acquisition of Meda on August 5, 2016 and the integration of our portfolio across our branded, generics and over-the-counter platforms in all of our regions, effective October 1, 2016, the Company is expanding its reportable segments. The Company will report its results in three segments on a geographic basis as follows: (1) North America, (2) Europe and (3) Rest of World. This change in segment reporting will begin with the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2016. Comparative segment financial information will be recast for prior periods to conform to this revised segment structure. 
  On August 25, 2016, the Company announced that it was immediately expanding already existing patient assistance programs for   EpiPen  Auto-Injector  . On August 29, 2016, the Company announced that its U.S. subsidiary will launch the first authorized generic to   EpiPen  Auto-Injector  . The Company intends to continue to market and distribute branded   EpiPen  Auto-Injector  .  
  Meda AB    
  On   February 10, 2016  , the Company issued an offer announcement under the Nasdaq Stockholm s Takeover Rules and the Swedish Takeover Act (collectively, the  Swedish Takeover Rules ) setting forth a public offer to the shareholders of   Meda AB   (publ.) (   Meda   ) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of   Meda   (the    Offer   ), with an enterprise value, including the net debt of   Meda  , of approximately Swedish kronor ( SEK  or  kr )   83.6 billion   (based on a SEK/USD exchange rate of   8.4158  ) or   $9.9 billion   at announcement. On   August 2, 2016  , the Company announced that the Offer was accepted by Meda shareholders holding an aggregate of approximately   343 million   shares, representing approximately   94%   of the total number of outstanding Meda shares, as of   July 29, 2016  , and the Company declared the Offer unconditional. On   August 5, 2016  , settlement occurred with respect to the Meda shares duly tendered by July 29, 2016 and, as a result, Meda is now a controlled subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Offer, each Meda shareholder that duly tendered Meda shares into the Offer received at settlement (1) in respect of   80%   of the number of Meda shares tendered by such shareholder,   165kr   in cash  
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  

per Meda share, and (2) in respect of the remaining   20%   of the number of Meda shares tendered by such shareholder,   0.386   of the Company s ordinary shares per Meda share (subject to treatment of fractional shares as described in the offer document published on June 16, 2016). The non-tendered shares will be acquired for cash through a compulsory acquisition proceeding, in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)), with advance title to such non-tendered shares expected to be acquired within six to twelve months of the acquisition date. The compulsory acquisition proceeding price will accrue interest as required by the Swedish Companies Act. Meda s shares were delisted from the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange on August 23, 2016. On November 1, 2016, the Company made an offer to the remaining Meda shareholders to tender all their Meda shares for cash consideration of   161.31kr   per Meda share (the  November Offer ) to provide such remaining shareholders with an opportunity to sell their shares in Meda to the Company in advance of the automatic acquisition of their shares for cash in connection with the compulsory acquisition proceeding. The acceptance period for the November Offer expires on November 23, 2016 and settlement is expected to occur on or around November 30, 2016. Meda shareholders who tender their shares in the November Offer will not have the right to withdraw their acceptances, and there are no conditions to the completion of the November Offer. Any Meda shareholders that do not accept the November Offer will automatically receive all-cash consideration plus statutory interest for their Meda shares as determined in the compulsory acquisition proceeding. The November Offer is not being made, nor will any tender of share be accepted from or on behalf of holders in, any jurisdiction in which the making of the November Offer or the acceptance of any tender of shares would contravene applicable laws or regulations or require any offer documents, filings or other measures. In connection with either the November Offer or the compulsory acquisition proceeding, it has been assumed that the fair value of the non-tendered shares would be approximately   161kr   per share at settlement, and the shares will be purchased with all cash.  
  The total purchase price was approximately   $6.92 billion  , net of cash acquired, which includes cash consideration paid of approximately   $5.3 billion  , the issuance of approximately   26.4 million   Mylan N.V. ordinary shares at a fair value of approximately   $1.3 billion   based on the closing price of the Company s ordinary shares on   August 5, 2016  , as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Stock Market (the  NASDAQ ) and an assumed liability of approximately   $431.0 million   related to the November Offer and the compulsory acquisition proceeding of the non-tendered Meda shares, which is classified as a current liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
  Refer to Note   4     Acquisitions and Other Transactions   in  Item 1.   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    for additional information regarding significant recent events, including other acquisitions and transactions. 
  Litigation Settlements and Other Contingencies, Net 
  On October 7, 2016, the Company agreed to the terms of a   $465 million   settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other government agencies related to the classification of the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (the    Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement   ). This amount is included in litigation settlements and other contingencies, net in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  On November 1, 2016, the Company and Strides agreed on a settlement of substantially all outstanding regulatory, warranty and indemnity claims (the  Strides Settlement ). As a result of the settlement, the Company will also have access to approximately   $80 million   of cash in the fourth quarter of 2016 which is currently contingently restricted. In addition, the Company recorded approximately   $90 million   of expense in the third quarter of 2016. This amount is included in litigation settlements and other contingencies, net in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Refer to Note   18     Contingencies   in  Item 1.   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements    for additional information regarding these two items. 
   
  Financial Summary 
  The tables below are a summary of the Company s financial results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period: 
  
   63 

     Table of Contents  

Earnings from operations decreased for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period primarily due to the recognition of the   Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement   and the Strides Settlement, both of which are included in litigation settlements and other contingencies, net in the   Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations   in the current quarter, as well as higher amortization expense and operating expenses related to acquisitions completed during 2016. These items were partially offset by an increase in total revenues and the tax benefit that the Company realized during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

The   decrease   in earnings from operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the   Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement   and the Strides Settlement. In addition, diluted earnings per ordinary share attributable to   Mylan N.V.   ordinary shareholders for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period was also impacted by higher amortization expense and operating expenses related to acquisitions completed during 2016, losses related to the Company s SEK denominated foreign currency contracts, the write off of financing fees related to the termination of the 2016 Bridge Credit Agreement (defined below) and a higher average share count due to the impact of the ordinary shares issued in the EPD Transaction. These items were partially offset by an increase in total revenues and the tax benefit that the Company realized during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  A detailed discussion of the Company s financial results can be found below in the section titled  Results of Operations.  As part of this discussion, we also report sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measure of  constant currency  third party net sales and total revenues. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year s foreign exchange rates. We routinely evaluate our third party net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating a period-to-period comparison of our operational activities, and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason. The following table compares third party net sales on an actual and constant currency basis for each reportable segment and the geographic regions within the Generics segment and consolidated total revenues on an actual and constant currency basis for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  More information about non-GAAP measures used by the Company as part of this discussion, including adjusted cost of sales, adjusted gross margins, adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS can be found in  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

    Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified sales from its Brazilian operation from Rest of World to North America. The amount reclassified for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   was approximately   $11.0 million  . 
               (4)   
    For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , adjusted third party net sales in Europe totaled   $629.0 million  , adjusted generics segment third party net sales totaled   $2.26 billion   and adjusted total revenues were   $2.71 billion  . Adjusted third party net sales in Europe, adjusted generics segment third party net sales, and adjusted total revenues are non-GAAP financial measures that are discussed further in the section titled   Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Total Revenues  
  For the current quarter, Mylan reported total revenues of   $3.06 billion  , compared to   $2.70 billion   for the comparable prior year period, representing   an increase   of   $361.9 million  , or   13%  . Total revenues include both net sales and other revenues from third parties. Third party net sales for the current quarter were   $3.03 billion  , compared to   $2.68 billion   for the comparable prior year period, representing   an increase   of   $353.3 million  , or   13%  . Other third party revenues for the current quarter were   $27.6 million  , compared to   $19.0 million   for the comparable prior year period,   an increase   of   $8.6 million  . 
  The   increase   in total revenues included third party net sales growth in Generics of   17%   as a result of the acquisitions of   Meda   and the   Topicals Business  , and to a lesser extent, net sales from products launched subsequent to   October 1, 2015   ( new products ), which combined totaled approximately   $534.9 million  . This   increase   was partially offset by a decrease in net sales from existing products of approximately   $218.6 million   due to a combination of lower pricing and volumes in the current period. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on current period total revenues was approximately   $19.8 million  .  
  From time to time, a limited number of our products may represent a significant portion of our net sales, gross profit and net earnings. Generally, this is due to the timing of new product introductions and the amount, if any, of additional competition in the market. Our top ten products in terms of sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately   30%   and   33%   of the Company s total revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Generics Segment 
  For the current quarter, Generics third party net sales were   $2.61 billion  , compared to   $2.24 billion   for the comparable prior year period,   an increase   of   $372.4 million  , or   17%  . In the Generics segment, foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on third party net sales of approximately   $19.8 million  , or   1%   in the current quarter. As such, constant currency third party net sales   increased   by approximately   $352.6 million  , or   16%   when compared to the prior year period. The graph below shows Generics third party net sales by region for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the increase period over period: 
  
  Third party net sales from North America   increased   by   $8.2 million   or   1%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the prior year period. This   increase   was principally due to net sales from the acquisitions of   Meda   and the   Topicals Business  , and to a lesser extent, net sales from new product introductions as a result of leveraging our global platform, together totaling approximately   $213.6 million  . This increase was partially offset by lower volumes and pricing on existing products. The prior year period included the significant contribution of new products. The impact of foreign currency translation on current period third party net sales was insignificant within North America.  
  Products generally contribute most significantly to revenues and gross margins at the time of their launch, even more so in periods of market exclusivity, or in periods of limited generic competition. As such, the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on the Company s financial results. The entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Additionally, pricing is often affected by factors outside of the Company s control. 
  Third party net sales from Europe   increased   by   $230.1 million   or   38%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the prior year period. The   increase   in third party net sales was primarily the result of net sales from the acquisition of   Meda  , and to a lesser extent, net sales from new product introductions, totaling approximately   $220.4 million   in  
  
   66 

     Table of Contents  

the   third quarter   of   2016  . Pricing and volumes were essentially flat in the   third quarter   of   2016   as a result of our diversified product portfolio. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on current period third party net sales was   $7.9 million  , or   1%   within Europe. As such, constant currency third party net sales   increased   by approximately   $238.0 million  , or   39%   when compared to the prior year period.  
  Third party net sales from Mylan s business in France increased when compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of net sales from the acquisition of   Meda   and new product introductions, and we   remain the generics market leader  . In Italy, third party net sales increased when compared to the prior year period as a result of net sales from the acquisition of Meda. 
  Certain markets within Europe in which we do business have undergone government-imposed price reductions, and further government-imposed price reductions are expected in the future. Such measures, along with the tender systems discussed below, are likely to have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. However, government initiatives in certain markets that appear to favor generic products could help to mitigate this unfavorable effect by increasing rates of generic substitution and penetration. 
  Third party net sales from Rest of World   increased   by   $134.1 million  , or   25%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquisition of Meda principally in emerging markets, and to a lesser extent, net sales from new product introductions, together totaling approximately   $101.1 million  . In addition, net sales from existing products increased slightly, as higher volumes offset lower pricing throughout the region, including in our anti-retroviral ( ARV ) franchise. Sales within our ARV franchise progressively improved throughout the third quarter of 2016 as HIV tender volumes increased. Third party net sales from Rest of World were favorably impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation by approximately   $26.7 million  , or   5%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . As such, constant currency third party net sales increased by approximately   $107.3 million  , or   20%  . 
  In addition to third party net sales, the Rest of World region also supplies finished dosage form ( FDF ) generic products and API to Mylan subsidiaries in conjunction with the Company s vertical integration strategy. Intercompany sales recognized by Rest of World were approximately   $249.0 million   and   $205.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These intercompany sales eliminate within, and therefore are not included in Generics or consolidated third party net sales. 
  In Japan, third party net sales increased as a result of net sales from new products and higher volumes on existing products. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable pricing on existing products. In Australia, third party net sales increased primarily as a result of new product introductions, and to a lesser extent, net sales from the acquisition of   Meda  . As in Europe, both Australia and Japan have undergone government-imposed price reductions that have had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. 
  A number of markets in which we operate have implemented, or may implement, tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. Generally speaking, tender systems can have an unfavorable impact on sales and profitability. Under such tender systems, manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products. Upon winning the tender, the winning company will receive preferential reimbursement for a period of time. The tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender. The loss of a tender by a third party to whom we supply API can also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability. Sales continue to be negatively affected by the impact of tender systems.

  Specialty third party net sales   decreased   by   $19.1 million   or   4%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the prior year period. The   decrease   was primarily the result of lower unit volumes due to the timing of wholesaler purchases of the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector   in anticipation of the authorized generic launch. 
  Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
  Cost of sales   increased   from   $1.38 billion   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $1.77 billion   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , corresponding to the increase in sales. Cost of sales was primarily impacted by purchase accounting related amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related costs and restructuring and other special items, which are described further in the section titled   Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.   Gross profit for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.28 billion   and gross margins were   42%  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , gross profit was   $1.32 billion   and gross margins were   49%  . Gross margins were negatively impacted in the current quarter by increased purchase accounting related items, primarily amortization, as a result of the acquisitions of Meda and the Topicals Business, and the significant contribution in the prior year period of new products. Adjusted gross margins were approximately   57%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to approximately   58%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the acquisition of Meda and new product introductions each positively impacted adjusted gross margins by   50   basis points, respectively. These increases were offset by the significant contribution in the prior year period of new products.

A reconciliation between cost of sales, as reported under U.S. GAAP, and adjusted cost of sales and adjusted gross margin for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   is as follows:   
 ____________ 
            (a)   
    Adjusted gross profit is calculated as total revenues (adjusted total revenues for   2015  ) less adjusted cost of sales. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues (adjusted total revenues for   2015  ). 
       
  Operating Expenses 
  Research   Development Expense 
  R D expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $199.1 million  , compared to   $174.8 million   for the comparable prior year period,   an increase   of   $24.3 million  . The   increase   is primarily due to the inclusion of   Meda   and the   Topicals Business  , which increased R D expense by approximately   $12 million   in the current quarter. R D expense also   increased   due to expenses of approximately   $9.0 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   related to the Company s collaboration agreement entered into on January 8, 2016 with   Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   (   Momenta   ). The remainder is driven by the continued development of our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. 
  Selling, General   Administrative Expense 
  Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG A ) for the current quarter was   $656.9 million  , compared to   $537.1 million   for the comparable prior year period,   an increase   of   $119.8 million  . The increase in SG A is primarily due to the additional expense related to the acquisitions of   Meda   and the   Topicals Business   which increased SG A by approximately   $106.8 million   in the current quarter. In addition, SG A increased due to increased employee related costs and increased depreciation expense as a result of information technology related capital expenditures. 
  Litigation Settlements and Other Contingencies, Net 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded a   charge  , net of   $558.0 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively. In the current year period, the   charge   was primarily related to the   Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement   and the Strides Settlement. In the prior year period, the charge was primarily related to the settlement of an anti-trust matter. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled   $144.4 million  , compared to   $95.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $49.3 million  . The   increase   in the current quarter is primarily due to   $59.3 million   of interest related to the issuance of the June 2016 Senior Notes (as defined below) and approximately   $17.7 million   of interest related to borrowings acquired from Meda. Partially offsetting these increases was lower amortization of discounts as a result of the repayment of the Company s Cash Convertible Notes due 2015 (the  Cash Convertible Notes ) in September 2015, and the result of the refinancing of certain debt instruments in 2015.

Other Expense, Net    
  Other expense, net  , was   $50.2 million   in the current quarter, compared to   $50.9 million   for the comparable prior year period.   Other expense, net  , includes losses from equity affiliates, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest and dividend income.   Other expense, net   was comprised of the following for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

In the   third quarter   of   2016  , foreign exchange losses of   $27.8 million   included   $44.4 million   of losses related to the Company s SEK non-designated foreign currency contracts partially offset by foreign currency gains. 
  Income Tax (Benefit) Provision 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized an income tax   benefit   of   $205.5 million  , compared to an income tax   provision   of   $26.5 million   for the comparable prior year period. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received approvals from the relevant Indian regulatory authorities to legally merge its wholly owned subsidiary,   Jai Pharma Limited  , into   Mylan Laboratories Limited  . The merger resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of   $150 million   for the tax deductible goodwill in excess of the book goodwill with a corresponding benefit to income tax provision for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . In addition to the benefit recognized for the merger of the aforementioned entities, the effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   versus the comparable prior quarter period was impacted by the   Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement  .

    Currency impact is shown as unfavorable (favorable). 
               (2)   
    The constant currency revenue change is derived by translating third party net sales for the current period at prior year comparative period exchange rates. 
               (3)   
    Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified sales from its Brazilian operation from Rest of World to North America. The amount reclassified for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was approximately   $32.3 million  . 
               (4)   
    For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , adjusted third party net sales in Europe totaled   $1.61 billion  , adjusted generics segment third party net sales totaled   $5.95 billion   and adjusted total revenues were   $6.96 billion  . Adjusted third party net sales in Europe, adjusted generics segment third party net sales, and adjusted total revenues are non-GAAP financial measures that are discussed further in the section titled   Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
               (5)   
    The percentage changes in intersegment sales are considered not meaningful (or,  NM ) in terms of the Company s total revenue as intersegment sales eliminate in consolidation. 
     Total Revenues  
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Mylan reported total revenues of   $7.81 billion  , compared to   $6.94 billion   for the comparable prior year period, representing   an increase   of   $870.5 million  , or   13%  . Total revenues include both net sales and other revenues from third parties. Third party net sales for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $7.75

billion  , compared to   $6.89 billion   for the comparable prior year period, representing   an increase   of   $857.7 million  , or   12%  . Other third party revenues for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $63.6 million  , compared to   $50.8 million   for the comparable prior year period,   an increase   of   $12.8 million  . 
  The   increase   in total revenues included third party net sales growth in Generics of   12%   and Specialty of   12%  . Contributing to this increase was net sales from the acquisitions of   Meda   and the   Topicals Business   and net sales from new product introductions, and to a lesser extent, the two additional months of net sales from the   EPD Business   ( incremental EPD Business sales ) in the Generics segment when compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , all of which combined totaled approximately   $920.4 million  . Net sales from existing products   decreased   approximately   $67.9 million   as a result of a   decline   in pricing of approximately   $99.7 million  , partially offset by an increase in volumes of approximately   $31.8 million  . Mylan s total revenues were   unfavorably   impacted by the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting changes in the U.S. Dollar as compared to the currencies of Mylan s subsidiaries in Canada, the European Union, India, and the United Kingdom, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on current year total revenues was approximately   $12.3 million   resulting in an increase in constant currency total revenues of approximately   $882.8 million  , or   13%  .  
  From time to time, a limited number of our products may represent a significant portion of our net sales, gross profit and net earnings. Generally, this is due to the timing of new product introductions and the amount, if any, of additional competition in the market. Our top ten products in terms of sales, in the aggregate, represented approximately   30%   of the Company s total revenues for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Generics Segment 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Generics third party net sales were   $6.68 billion  , compared to   $5.94 billion   for the comparable prior year period,   an increase   of   $739.3 million  , or   12%  . In the Generics segment, foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact on third party net sales of approximately   $12.0 million   in the current year period. As such, constant currency third party net sales   increased   by approximately   $751.3 million  , or   13%   when compared to the prior year period. The graph below shows Generics third party net sales by region for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the increase period over period: 
  
  Third party net sales from North America   increased   by   $134.5 million   or   5%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the prior year period. This   increase   was principally due to net sales from the acquisitions of   Meda  , the   Topicals Business  , the incremental   EPD Business   sales, and to a lesser extent, net sales from new product introductions as a result of our global platform, together totaling approximately   $312.5 million  . This increase was partially offset by lower pricing on existing products while volumes on existing products increased slightly. The impact of foreign currency translation on the current period third party net sales was insignificant within North America.  
  Products generally contribute most significantly to revenues and gross margins at the time of their launch, even more so in periods of market exclusivity, or in periods of limited generic competition. As such, the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on the Company s financial results. The entrance into the market of additional competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Additionally, pricing is often affected by factors outside of the Company s control. 
  Third party net sales from Europe   increased   by   $444.7 million   or   28%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the prior year period. This   increase   was primarily the result of the acquisition of   Meda  , the incremental   EPD Business   sales, and to a lesser extent, net sales from new product introductions, together totaling approximately   $408.5

million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . In addition, there were higher volumes on existing products, while pricing was essentially flat as a result of our diversified product portfolio. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on current period third party net sales was   $10.2 million  , or   1%   within Europe. As such, constant currency third party net sales   increased   by approximately   $454.9 million  , or   29%   when compared to the prior year period.  
  Third party net sales from Mylan s business in France   increased   when compared to the prior year as a result of the acquisition of   Meda   and the incremental   EPD Business   sales, higher volumes and pricing on existing products and new product introductions. Our market share in France increased for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and we   remain the generics market leader  . In Italy, third party net sales   increased   when compared to the prior year period as a result of the acquisition of   Meda   and the incremental   EPD Business   sales, and to a lesser extent, new product introductions, which was partially offset by lower sales of existing products.  
  Certain markets in Europe in which we do business have undergone government-imposed price reductions, and further government-imposed price reductions are expected in the future. Such measures, along with the tender systems discussed below, are likely to have a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. However, government initiatives in certain markets that appear to favor generic products could help to mitigate this unfavorable effect by increasing rates of generic substitution and penetration. 
  Third party net sales from Rest of World   increased   by   $160.1 million   or   11%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the prior year period. This   increase   was primarily driven by the acquisition of   Meda  , the incremental   EPD Business   sales, and to a lesser extent, new product introductions across the region, together totaling   $199.4 million  , combined with higher sales volumes in Japan, India and emerging markets. These increases were partially offset by lower pricing in the region, including the ARV franchise. However, sales within our ARV franchise progressively grew throughout the first nine months of the year, and on a sequential basis third quarter sales increased over 30% from the second quarter of 2016. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on current period third party net sales was   $9.1 million  , or   1%   within Rest of World. As such, constant currency third party net sales   increased   by approximately   $151.0 million  , or   10%  .  
  In addition to third party net sales, the Rest of World region also supplies FDF generic products and API to Mylan subsidiaries in conjunction with the Company s vertical integration strategy. Intercompany sales recognized by Rest of World were approximately   $684.1 million   and   $522.1 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These intercompany sales eliminate within, and therefore are not included in Generics or consolidated third party net sales. 
  In Japan, third party net sales   increased   as a result of the incremental   EPD Business   sales, higher volumes on existing products and net sales from new product introductions. In Australia, third party net sales increased as result of net sales from new product introductions, the incremental   EPD Business   sales, and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of   Meda   and higher volumes on existing products. Within these countries, net sales from existing products increased as higher volumes offset lower pricing. As in Europe, both Australia and Japan have undergone government-imposed price reductions that have had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on sales and gross profit in these markets. 
  A number of markets in which we operate have implemented, or may implement, tender systems for generic pharmaceuticals in an effort to lower prices. Generally speaking, tender systems can have an unfavorable impact on sales and profitability. Under such tender systems, manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products. Upon winning the tender, the winning company will receive preferential reimbursement for a period of time. The tender system often results in companies underbidding one another by proposing low pricing in order to win the tender. Additionally, the loss of a tender by a third party to whom we supply API can also have a negative impact on our sales and profitability. Sales continue to be negatively affected by the impact of tender systems. 
  Specialty Segment

Specialty third party net sales   increased   by   $118.4 million   or   12%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   when compared to the prior year period. The   increase   was primarily the result of the realization of the benefits of customer contract negotiations over the last several quarters related to the   EpiPen  Auto-Injector  , and higher sales of the   Perforomist  Inhalation Solution   and   ULTIVA   , partially offset by lower volumes across the segment.  
  Cost of Sales and Gross Profit 
  Cost of sales increased from   $3.79 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $4.45 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , corresponding to the increase in sales. Cost of sales was primarily impacted by purchase accounting related amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related costs and restructuring and other special items, which are described further in the section titled   Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  . In addition to the increase in net sales, the increase in cost of sales was also impacted by acquisition related amortization expense of   Meda  , the   Topicals Business   and Jai Pharma Limited as well as an additional two months of amortization expense related to the EPD Business as compared to the prior year period. Gross profit for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $3.36 billion   and gross margins were   43%  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , gross profit was   $3.15 billion   and gross margins were   45%  . Gross margins were positively impacted in the current year by new product introductions and higher sales within Specialty which positively impacted gross margins by approximately   50   and   70   basis points, respectively. These increases were offset by the negative impact of increased purchase accounting related items, primarily amortization, as a result of the acquisitions of Meda and the Topicals Business, and the significant contribution in the prior year period of new products. Adjusted gross margins were approximately   56%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to approximately   55%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the combined impact of acquisitions and new product introductions and higher sales within Specialty positively impacted adjusted gross margins by approximately   50   basis points and   30   basis points, respectively. These increases were partially offset by the significant contribution in the prior year period of new products.

  Operating Expenses 
  Research   Development Expense 
  R D expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $632.2 million  , compared to   $512.9 million   for the comparable prior year period,   an increase   of   $119.3 million  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company made an upfront payment to Momenta for   $45 million   related to the Company s collaboration agreement and incurred approximately   $22.3 million   of additional R D expense related to the collaboration. The inclusion of   Meda   and the   Topicals Business   increased R D expense by approximately   $12 million   and the additional two months of expense related to the   EPD Business   in the current year increased R D expense by approximately   $9 million  . R D expense also   increased   due to the continued development of our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred approximately   $15 million   of milestone payments related to the collaboration with Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ( Theravance Biopharma ). In the prior year period, the Company incurred a   $15 million   upfront licensing payment related to the collaboration with Theravance Biopharma.  
  Selling, General   Administrative Expense 
  SG A for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $1.79 billion  , compared to   $1.58 billion   for the comparable prior year period,   an increase   of   $203.1 million  . Factors contributing to the   increase   in SG A include additional expense related to the acquisitions of   Meda  , the   Topicals Business   and the   EPD Business   which increased SG A by approximately   $175.4 million  . In addition, the increase in SG A is due to increased employee compensation expense as well as increased depreciation expense as a result of information technology related capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by decreases in consulting and professional services expense of approximately   $24.1 million   and legal expense of approximately   $27.0 million  , primarily due to higher acquisition related costs incurred in the prior year period.  
  Litigation Settlements and Other Contingencies, Net 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded a   charge  , net of   $556.4 million   and   $19.1 million  , respectively. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   charge   was primarily related to the   Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement   and the Strides Settlement. In the prior year period, the charge was primarily related to the settlement of antitrust matters, partially offset by the settlement of patent infringement matters.

Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $305.0 million  , compared to   $268.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $36.5 million  . The   increase   in the current year is primarily due to approximately   $73.2 million   of interest related to the issuance of the June 2016 Senior Notes and approximately   $17.7 million   of interest related to borrowings acquired from Meda. Partially offsetting these increases was lower amortization of discounts as a result of the repayment of the Company s Cash Convertible Notes in September 2015, and the result of the refinancing of certain debt instruments in 2015. 
  Other Expense, Net    
  Other expense, net  , was   $184.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared   $71.4 million   for the comparable prior year period.   Other expense, net  , includes losses from equity affiliates, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest and dividend income.   Other expense, net   was comprised of the following for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

In the current year foreign exchange losses of approximately   $81.6 million   included   $128.6 million   of losses related to the Company s SEK non-designated foreign currency contracts partially offset by foreign exchange gains. 
  Income Tax (Benefit) Provision 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized an income tax   benefit   of   $165.7 million  , compared to an income tax   provision   of   $44.0 million   for the comparable prior year period. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received approvals from the relevant Indian regulatory authorities to legally merge its wholly owned subsidiary,   Jai Pharma Limited  , into   Mylan Laboratories Limited  . The merger resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of   $150 million   for the tax deductible goodwill in excess of the book goodwill with a corresponding benefit to income tax provision for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . In addition to the benefit recognized for the merger of the aforementioned entities, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the comparable prior year period was also impacted by the   Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement  .  
   
  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Whenever the Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure set forth below and should consider non-GAAP measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, since these are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning across companies, or as prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures or measures with the same title used by other companies. 
  Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, measuring its operating performance, and incentive-based awards. In addition, primarily due to acquisitions, we believe that an evaluation of our ongoing operations (and comparisons of our current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of our financial results was limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial

measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. The financial performance of the Company is measured by senior management, in part, using adjusted metrics as described below, along with other performance metrics. Management s annual incentive compensation is derived, in part, based on the adjusted EPS metric. 
  Adjusted Third Party Net Sales from Europe, Adjusted Generics Segment Third Party Net Sales, Adjusted Third Party Net Sales and Adjusted Total Revenues 
  The Company has provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted third party net sales from Europe, adjusted Generics segment third party net sales, adjusted third party net sales and adjusted total revenues, each of which excludes an acquisition related customer incentive in Europe from the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

Adjusted Cost of Sales and Adjusted Gross Margin 
  We use the non-GAAP financial measure  adjusted cost of sales  and the corresponding non-GAAP financial measure  adjusted gross margin.  The principal items excluded from adjusted cost of sales include restructuring, acquisition related and other special items and purchase accounting amortization and other related items, which are described in greater detail below. 
  Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS 
  Adjusted net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. ( adjusted earnings ) is a non-GAAP financial measure and provides an alternative view of performance used by management. Management believes that, primarily due to acquisition activity, an evaluation of the Company s ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share ( adjusted EPS ) are two of the most important internal financial metrics related to the ongoing operating performance of the Company, and management also believes that investors  understanding of our performance is enhanced by these adjusted measures. Actual internal and forecasted operating results and annual budgets include adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS.

The significant items excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS include: 
  Purchase Accounting Amortization and Other Related Items 
  The ongoing impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions is excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. These amounts include the amortization of intangible assets and inventory step-up, intangible asset impairment charges (including in-process research and development), accretion and the fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration. 
    
  Upfront and Milestone-Related R D Expenses 
  These expenses and payments are excluded from adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS because they generally occur at irregular intervals and are not indicative of the Company s ongoing operations. Also included in this adjustment are certain expenses related to the Company s collaboration agreement with   Momenta   including certain milestone related costs. Such costs include payments related to Mylan s future decisions, on a product by product basis, to continue with the development of such product in the collaboration after certain R D work is performed. Related amounts are excluded from adjusted earnings as Mylan considers such payments as additional upfront buy-in payments for the products. 
  Restructuring, Acquisition Related and Other Special Items 
  Costs related to restructuring, acquisition and integration activities and other actions are excluded from adjusted cost of sales, adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS, as applicable. These amounts include items such as:  
             
    Exit costs associated with facilities to be closed or divested, including employee separation costs, impairment charges, accelerated depreciation, incremental manufacturing variances, equipment relocation costs and other restructuring related costs;  
                
    Certain acquisition related remediation and integration and planning costs, as well as other costs associated with acquisitions such as advisory and legal fees and certain financing related costs, and other business transformation and/or optimization initiatives, which are not part of a formal restructuring program, including employee separation and post-employment costs;  
                
    The pre-tax loss of the Company s   clean energy investments  , whose activities qualify for income tax credits under Section 45 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code  only included in adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS is the net tax effect of the entity s activities; and 
                
    Certain costs to further develop and optimize our global enterprise resource planning systems, operations and supply chain. 
     The Company has undertaken restructurings and other optimization initiatives of differing types, scope and amount during the covered periods and, therefore, these charges should not be considered non-recurring; however, management excludes these amounts from adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS because it believes it is helpful to understanding the underlying, ongoing operational performance of the business. 
  Litigation Settlements, Net 
  Charges and gains related to legal matters, such as those discussed in the   Notes to interim financial statements     Note   18     Contingencies   are generally excluded from adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. Normal, ongoing defense costs of the Company made in the normal course of our business are not excluded. 
  Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS  
  A reconciliation between net earnings attributable to   Mylan N.V.   ordinary shareholders and diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to   Mylan N.V.   ordinary shareholders, as reported under U.S. GAAP, and adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS for the periods shown follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary source of liquidity is cash   provided by   operations, which was   $1.70 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We believe that cash provided by operating activities and available liquidity will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital, capital expenditures and interest and principal payments on debt obligations. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations, or fund planned capital expenditures, will substantially depend upon our future operating performance (which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions), and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
  Operating Activities 
  
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities   increased   by   $341.2 million   to   $1.70 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to net cash   provided by   operating activities of   $1.36 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   net increase   in cash   provided by   operating activities was principally due to the following: 

an increase in non-cash expenses of   $1.09 billion   including increased depreciation and amortization as a result of recent acquisitions of approximately   $355.0 million  ,   $465.0 million   related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement,   $90 million   related to the Strides Settlement, the write off of certain financing fees and a number of other charges including the accretion of contingent consideration and increased losses in equity method investments;  
                
    a net increase in the amount of cash provided by changes in accounts receivable, including estimated sales allowances of   $237.6 million  , reflecting the timing of sales, cash collections and disbursements related to sales allowances; and 
                
    a net decrease in the amount of cash used in changes in income taxes payable of   $229.8 million   as a result of a lower amount of estimated tax payments made during the current year. 
     These items were partially offset by the following: 
             
    a decrease in net earnings of   $590.6 million  , including a   $294.4 million   increase in the benefit for deferred income taxes; and 
                
    a   net decrease   in the amount of cash provided by changes in trade accounts payable of   $287.5 million   as a result of the timing of cash payments.

Investing Activities 
  
  Cash   used in   investing activities was   $7.08 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $639.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , a net increase of   $6.44 billion  . The net increase in cash   used in   investing activities was principally the result of the following:  
             
    an increase in net cash paid for acquisitions of   $6.15 billion   which relates to the Company s acquisitions of   Meda   and the   Topicals Business  ; 
                
    an unconditional deferred payment of   $308 million   relating to Meda s acquisition of Rottapharm S.p.A paid in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the acquisition of   Meda  ; 
                
    a   $128.6 million   settlement of the Company s non-designated foreign exchange forward and option contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with the payment of the Swedish krona-denominated cash portion of the purchase price of Meda; 
                
    an increase in restricted cash of   $76.4 million  . In the current year, restricted cash increased approximately   $50 million   related to amounts deposited in escrow for potential contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of the   Topicals Business  ; and 
                
    an increase in capital expenditures, primarily for equipment and facilities, which totaled approximately   $239.5 million   in the current period, compared to   $207.3 million   in the comparable prior year period. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, capital expenditures for the   2016   calendar year are expected to be approximately   $400 million   to   $450 million  . 
     These items were partially offset by the following: 
             
    a decrease in payments for product rights and other investing activities, net, which totaled   $196.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $428.2 million   in the prior year period. In the current year, the Company paid   $57.9 million   to acquire a marketed pharmaceutical product and   $90 million   to acquire certain European intellectual property rights and marketing authorizations, which was accrued for at December 31, 2015. The prior year payments were the result of the acquisition of certain commercialization rights in the U.S. and other countries; and 
                
    a   decrease   in the purchase of marketable securities, which totaled   $22.8 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $59.1 million   in the prior year period. This change is primarily attributable to the Company s investment in   Theravance Biopharma   s common stock in the prior year.

Financing Activities 
  
  Cash   provided by   financing activities was   $5.39 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to cash   used in   financing activities of   $318.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , a net increase of   $5.71 billion  . The net increase in cash   provided by   financing activities was principally the result of the following: 
               
    an increase in the change in short-term borrowings of   $378.3 million  . In the prior year period, the Company decreased the borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility (the  Receivables Facility ) by approximately $325 million, net. 
     These items were partially offset by the following: 
             
    a   decrease   in proceeds from the cash convertible note hedge which totaled   $1.97 billion   in the prior year as the cash convertible note hedge settled in the third quarter of 2015 in conjunction with the maturity and full redemption of the Cash Convertible Notes; and 

a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options which totaled   $11.1 million   in the current year, as compared to   $92.8 million   in the prior year period. 
       
  Capital Resources 
  Our cash and cash equivalents at our non-U.S. operations totaled   $1.19 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . These funds are available to purchase the non-tendered Meda shares through the November Offer and compulsory acquisition proceeding. The Company anticipates having sufficient U.S. liquidity, including existing borrowing capacity and cash to be generated from operations, to fund foreseeable U.S. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of non-U.S. cash. If these funds are ultimately needed for the Company s operations in the U.S., the Company may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. If funds are needed from the Company s subsidiaries that do not have an ultimate U.S. parent, the Company will generally not be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate these funds because its foreign parent would not be subject to tax on receipt of these distributions.

Meda Borrowings 
  Upon settlement of the Offer on August 5, 2016, Meda became a controlled subsidiary of Mylan. Meda is party to certain debt obligations, all of which remained outstanding following the settlement of the Offer. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repaid approximately   $567 million   of Meda s bank loans.

  Amendment to the Revolving Facility, 2015 Term Loans and 2014 Term Loan 
  On February 22, 2016, the Company and Mylan Inc. (the  Borrower ) entered into (i) Amendment No. 3 (the  Revolving Amendment ) to the Revolving Credit Agreement dated December 19, 2014, as amended on May 1, 2015, further amended on June 19, 2015 and further amended on October 28, 2015 (as amended further by the Revolving Amendment, the  Revolving Credit Agreement ) which provided for a   $1.65 billion   revolving facility (the  Revolving Facility ), among the Borrower, the Company, certain lenders and issuing banks and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, (ii) Amendment No. 2 (the  2015 Term Amendment ) to the Term Credit Agreement dated July 15, 2015, as amended on October 28, 2015 (as amended further by the 2015 Term Amendment, the  2015 Term Credit Agreement ) which provided for a delayed-draw term loan credit facility including loans totaling   $1.6 billion   (the  2015 Term Loans ), among the Borrower, the Company, certain lenders and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and (iii) Amendment No. 3 (the  2014 Term Amendment ) to the Term Credit Agreement dated December 19, 2014, as amended on May 1, 2015 and further amended on October 28, 2015 (as amended further by the 2014 Term Amendment, the  2014 Term Credit Agreement ) which provided for an   $800 million   term loan (the  2014 Term Loan ), among the Borrower, the Company, certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Revolving Amendment, 2015 Term Amendment and 2014 Term Amendment provide that the Company s acquisition of Meda constitutes a Qualified Acquisition (as defined in each of the Revolving Credit Agreement, the 2014 Term Credit Agreement and the 2015 Term Credit Agreement) and amends the event of default provisions to provide that any  change of control  put rights under any indebtedness of any Acquired Entity or Business (as defined in each of the Revolving Credit Agreement, the 2014 Term Credit Agreement and the 2015 Term Credit Agreement) or its subsidiaries that are triggered as a result of the acquisition of any Acquired Entity or Business will not result in an event of default so long as any such indebtedness that is put in accordance with the terms of such indebtedness is paid as required by the terms of such indebtedness.

Long-term Debt Maturity 
  Mandatory minimum repayments remaining on the outstanding long-term debt at   September 30, 2016  , excluding the discounts and premiums, are as follows for each of the periods ending December 31: 
  
  The Company s next significant debt maturity is on November 29, 2016, as the Company s 1.350% Senior Notes due 2016 mature. The Company intends to utilize available liquidity to fund the repayment of the 1.350% Senior Notes due 2016. In addition, the loans of   $233.3 million   under Meda s Loan Agreement, due October 2017, are callable by the lender as a result of the completion of the Offer. The Company expects to use available liquidity to repay this amount if called. 
  The Company s 2015 Term Loans, 2014 Term Loan and Revolving Facility contain customary affirmative covenants for facilities of this type, including among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements, notices of default and certain material events, maintenance of corporate existence and rights, property, and insurance and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants for facilities of this type, including limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness, liens, mergers and certain other fundamental changes, investments and loans, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates, payments of dividends and other restricted payments and changes in our lines of business. The 2015 Term Loans, 2014 Term Loan and Revolving Facility contain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio financial covenant. We have been compliant with these financial covenants during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and we expect to remain in compliance for the next twelve months. 
  Collaboration and Licensing Agreements 
  We periodically enter into collaboration and licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the development, manufacture, marketing and/or sale of pharmaceutical products. Our significant collaboration agreements are focused on the development, manufacturing, supply and commercialization of multiple, high-value generic biologic compounds, insulin analog products and respiratory products. Under these agreements, we have future potential milestone payments and co-development expenses payable to third parties as part of our licensing, development and co-development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and are payable upon the satisfaction or achievement of certain developmental, regulatory or commercial milestones or as development expenses are incurred on defined projects. Milestone payment obligations are uncertain, including the prediction of timing and the occurrence of events triggering a future obligation and are not reflected as liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, except for milestone and royalty obligations reflected as acquisition contingent consideration. These agreements may also include potential sales based milestones and call for us to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty or a profit share. These sales based milestones or royalty obligations may be significant depending upon the level of commercial sales for each product.  
  Our most significant contingent payment relates to the potential future consideration related to the respiratory delivery platform. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and the ultimate success of the respective projects. Given the inherent uncertainty of these events, it is unclear when, if ever, we may be required to pay such amounts or pay amounts in excess of those accrued. The Company has also recorded contingent consideration related to the acquisition of the   Topicals Business  , the acquisition of Jai Pharma Limited, the acquisition of   Agila   Specialties Private Limited ( Agila ) and certain other acquisitions. The amount of contingent consideration recorded was   $651.5 million   and   $526.4 million   at  
  
   86 

     Table of Contents  

September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Approximately   $110 million   related to the Strides Settlement is included in the balance at   September 30, 2016  . In addition, the Company expects to incur approximately   $35 million   to   $40 million   of annual accretion expense related to the increase in the net present value of the contingent consideration liability. 
  On January 8, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with   Momenta   to develop, manufacture and commercialize up to   six   of   Momenta   s current biosimilar candidates, including   Momenta   s biosimilar candidate, ORENCIA  (abatacept). Mylan paid an up-front cash payment of   $45 million   to Momenta. Under the terms of the agreement, Momenta is eligible to receive additional contingent milestone payments of   up to     $200 million  . The Company and   Momenta   will jointly be responsible for product development and will equally share in the costs and profits related to the products. Under the agreement, Mylan will lead the worldwide commercialization efforts. 
  On November 2, 2016, the Company and Momenta announced that dosing had begun in a Phase 1 study to compare the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of M834, a proposed bisoimilar or ORENCIA  (abatacept), to U.S. and European Union sourced ORENCIA  in normal healthy volunteers. Under the agreement, Momenta has achieved the milestone necessary to earn a   $25 million   payment from the Company which will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  We are actively pursuing, and are currently involved in, joint projects related to the development, distribution and marketing of both generic and branded products. Many of these arrangements provide for payments by us upon the attainment of specified milestones. While these arrangements help to reduce the financial risk for unsuccessful projects, fulfillment of specified milestones or the occurrence of other obligations may result in fluctuations in cash flows. 
  Other Commitments  
  We are involved in various legal proceedings that are considered normal to our business. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and could cause the market value of our ordinary shares to decline. We have approximately   $525 million   accrued for legal contingencies, the majority of which relates to the   Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Settlement  . For certain contingencies assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of the former Merck Generics business, Merck KGaA, the seller, has agreed to indemnify Mylan. Strides has also agreed to indemnify Mylan for certain contingencies related to our acquisition of   Agila  . The inability or denial of Merck KGaA,   Strides Arcolab  , or another indemnitor or insurer to pay on an indemnified claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or ordinary share price. 
  We are continuously evaluating the potential acquisition of products, as well as companies, as a strategic part of our future growth. Consequently, we may utilize current cash reserves or incur additional indebtedness to finance any such acquisitions, which could impact future liquidity. In addition, on an ongoing basis, we review our operations including the evaluation of potential divestitures of products and businesses as part of our future strategy. Any divestitures could impact future liquidity.

     For a discussion of the Company s market risk, see  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in   Mylan N.V.   s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as amended. 
   
           ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
     An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
  Management identified the following change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting ( ICFR ) that occurred during the quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s ICFR. During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company began to implement and use a new Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) system in certain countries, which, when completed, will handle the business, financial and administrative processes for the Company. The Company has modified and will continue to modify its internal controls relating to its business and  
  
   87 

     Table of Contents  

financial processes throughout the entire ERP system implementation, which is expected to progress through the end of calendar 2017. While the Company believes that this new system and the related changes to internal controls will ultimately strengthen its ICFR, there are inherent risks in implementing any new ERP system and the Company will continue to evaluate and test control changes in order to provide certification as of its fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 on the effectiveness of its ICFR. 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Meda. Meda represented approximately   11%   and   4%   of the Company s consolidated total revenues for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and its assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) represented approximately   36%   of the Company s consolidated total assets, at September 30, 2016. Management did not include Meda when conducting its evaluation of changes in ICFR as of September 30, 2016. Meda is expected to be excluded from Management's evaluation of the Company's ICFR at December, 31 2016.

    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
     For information regarding legal proceedings, refer to Note   18     Contingencies  , in the accompanying   Notes to interim financial statements   in this Quarterly Report. 
   
           ITEM 1A.    
    RISK FACTORS 
     Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in Mylan s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as amended, and Mylan s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
  Risks Related to the Business of Mylan 
  WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED SCRUTINY FROM THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTS, OR NEGATIVE PUBLICITY WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS AND PRICING PRACTICES, AND OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO THE COMPANY, AND WE HAVE AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE PRICING PRESSURE ON THE PRICE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO SOCIAL OR POLITICAL PRESSURE TO LOWER THE COST OF DRUGS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE AND FUTURE PROFITABILITY. 
    
  There has been increased press coverage and increased scrutiny from third parties, including regulators, legislative bodies and enforcement agencies, with respect to matters relating to the Company s business and pricing practices, and other matters related to the Company. This increased press coverage, public scrutiny and protests by some consumers have included assertions of wrongdoing by the Company which, regardless of the factual or legal basis for such assertions, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, investigations, and calls for investigations, by governmental agencies at both the federal and state level and have resulted in, and may continue to result in, claims brought against the Company by governmental agencies or by private parties or by regulators taking other measures that could have a negative effect on the Company s business. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of any such investigations or claims or what other investigations or lawsuits or regulatory responses may result from such assertions, or their impact on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price. Any such investigation or claim could also result in reputational harm and reduced market acceptance and demand for our products, could harm our ability to market our products in the future, could cause us to incur significant expense, could cause our senior management to be distracted from execution of our business strategy, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 
  There has also recently been intense publicity regarding the pricing of pharmaceuticals more generally, including publicity and pressure resulting from prices charged by competitors and peer companies for new products as well as price increases by competitors and peer companies on older products that the public has deemed excessive. We have experienced and may continue to experience downward pricing pressure on the price of certain of our products due to social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs, which could reduce our revenue and future profitability.  
  Accompanying the press and media coverage of pharmaceutical pricing practices and public complaints about the same, there has been increasing U.S. federal and state legislative and enforcement interest with respect to drug pricing. In particular, U.S. federal prosecutors recently issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies, including Mylan, seeking information about their drug pricing practices, among other issues, and members of the U.S. Congress have sought information from certain pharmaceutical companies, including Mylan, relating to drug-price increases. Additionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in late 2015 the U.S. House of Representatives formed an Affordable Drug Pricing Task Force to advance legislation intended to control pharmaceutical drug costs and investigate pharmaceutical drug pricing. Since then, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate have conducted numerous hearings with respect to pharmaceutical drug pricing practices, including in connection with the investigation of specific price increases by several pharmaceutical companies such as Mylan. In addition to the effects of any investigations or claims brought against the Company described above, our revenue and future profitability could also be negatively affected if any such inquiries, of us or  
  
   89 

     Table of Contents  

of other pharmaceutical companies or the industry more generally, were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products. 
  Any of the events or developments described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as on our reputation.

    if the currency selected is another Optional Currency, the minimum amount (and, if higher, integral multiple) specified by the Agent pursuant to paragraph (B)(2) of clause 4.3   (Conditions relating to Optional Currencies)   or, if less, the Available Facility; and 
              (5) 
    in any event such that its Base Currency Amount is less than or equal to the Available Facility. 
              5.4. 
    Lenders  participation 
              (A)

    Unavailability of a currency 
     If before the Specified Time: 
           (A) 
    a Lender notifies the Agent that the Optional Currency requested is not readily available to it in the amount required; or 
              (B) 
    a Lender notifies the Agent that compliance with its obligation to participate in a Loan in the proposed Optional Currency would contravene a law or mandatory regulation applicable to it,  
     the Agent will give notice to the Company to that effect by the Specified Time on that day. In this event, any Lender that gives notice pursuant to this clause 6.2 will be required to participate in the Loan in the Base Currency (in an amount equal to that Lender s proportion of the Base Currency Amount) and its participation will be treated as a separate Loan denominated in the Base Currency during that Interest Period. 
            (A) 
    If a Term Loan is to be denominated in different currencies during two successive Interest Periods: 
              (1) 
    if the currency for the second Interest Period is an Optional Currency, the amount of the Loan in that Optional Currency will be calculated by the Agent as the amount of that Optional Currency equal to the Base Currency Amount of the Loan at the Agent s Spot Rate of Exchange at the Specified Time; 
              (2) 
    if the currency for the second Interest Period is the Base Currency, the amount of the Loan will be equal to the Base Currency Amount; 
              (3) 
    (unless the Agent and the Company agree otherwise in accordance with paragraph (B) below) the Company shall repay the Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period in the currency in which it was denominated for that Interest Period; and 
              (4) 
    (subject to clause 4.2   (Further conditions precedent))   the Lenders shall re-advance the Loan in the new currency in accordance with clause 6.5   (Agent s calculations). 
              (B) 
    If the Agent and the Company agree, the Agent shall: 
     
   31 
    
  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

(1) 
    apply the amount paid to it by the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (A)(4) above (or so much of that amount as is necessary) in or towards purchase of an amount in the currency in which the Term Loan is outstanding for the first Interest Period; and 
              (2) 
    use the amount it purchases in or towards satisfaction of the Company s obligations under paragraph (A)(3) above. 
              (C) 
    If the amount purchased by the Agent pursuant to paragraph (B)(1) above is less than the amount required to be repaid by the Company, the Agent shall promptly notify that Company and the Company shall, on the last day of the first Interest Period, pay an amount to the Agent (in the currency of the outstanding Term Loan for the first Interest Period) equal to the difference. 
              (D) 
    If any part of the amount paid to the Agent by the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (A)(4) above is not needed to purchase the amount required to be repaid by the Company, the Agent shall promptly notify the Company and pay the Company, on the last day of the first Interest Period that part of that amount (in the new currency). 
              6.4. 
    Same Optional Currency during successive Interest Periods 
              (A) 
    If a Term Loan is to be denominated in the same Optional Currency during two successive Interest Periods, the Agent shall calculate the amount of the Term Loan in the Optional Currency for the second of those Interest Periods (by calculating the amount of Optional Currency equal to the Base Currency Amount of that Term Loan at the Agent s Spot Rate of Exchange at the Specified Time) and (subject to paragraph (B) below): 
              (1) 
    if the amount calculated is less than the existing amount of that Term Loan in the Optional Currency during the first Interest Period, promptly notify the Company and the Company shall pay, on the last day of the first Interest Period, an amount equal to the difference; or 
              (2) 
    if the amount calculated is more than the existing amount of that Term Loan in the Optional Currency during the first Interest Period, promptly notify each Lender and, if no Default is continuing, each Lender shall, on the last day of the first Interest Period, pay its participation in an amount equal to the difference. 
              (B) 
    If the calculation made by the Agent pursuant to paragraph (A) above shows that the amount of the Term Loan in the Optional Currency for the second of those Interest Periods converted into the Base Currency at the Agent s Spot Rate of Exchange at the Specified Time has increased or decreased by less than 10 per cent. compared to its Base Currency Amount (taking into account any payments made pursuant to paragraph (A) above), no notification shall be made by the Agent and no payment shall be required under paragraph (A) above.

              (A) 
    All calculations made by the Agent pursuant to this clause 6 will take into account any repayment, prepayment, consolidation or division of Term Loans to be made on the last day of the first Interest Period. 
              (B) 
    Each Lender s participation in a Loan will, subject to paragraph (A) above, be determined in accordance with paragraph (B) of clause 5.4   (Lenders  participation).

              7.1. 
    Repayment of Facility A Loans 
     The Company shall repay the aggregate Facility A Loans in instalments by repaying on each Facility A Repayment Date an amount which reduces the Base Currency Amount of the outstanding aggregate Facility A Loans by the amount set out opposite that Facility A Repayment Date below.

              (b) 
    in the same currency as the maturing Facility C Loan (unless it arose as a result of the operation of clause 6.2   (Unavailability of a currency));   and 
              (c) 
    in whole or in part for the purpose of refinancing the maturing Facility C Loan; and 
              (2) 
    the proportion borne by each Lender s participation in the maturing Facility C Loan to the amount of that maturing Facility C Loan is the same as the proportion borne by that Lender s participation in the new Facility C Loans to the aggregate amount of those new Facility C Loans,

    that Lender shall promptly notify the Agent upon becoming aware of that event; 
              (B) 
    upon the Agent notifying the Company, the Commitments of that Lender will be immediately cancelled; and 
              (C)

              (2) 
    the shares of the Company are de-listed from the Nasdaq OMX Nordic Exchange, the Company shall without delay after becoming aware of such acquisition or de-listing give notice to the Agent thereof. The Agent may (and shall, if instructed by any of the Lenders) for a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of any such notice from the Company, negotiate with the Company with a view to agreeing terms and conditions acceptable to the Company and the Agent for continuing the Facilities.

     in each case in relation to that Recovery Claim. 
     Excluded Acquisition Proceeds    means any proceeds of a Recovery Claim which the Company notifies the Agent are, or are to be, applied: 
           (1) 
    in payment of amounts payable to the Vendor pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement by way of adjustment to the purchase price in respect of the Acquisition (except to the extent relating to a working capital adjustment); 
              (2) 
    to satisfy (or reimburse a member of the Group which has discharged) any liability, charge or claim upon a member of the Group by a person which is not a member of the Group; or 
              (3) 
    in the replacement, reinstatement and/or repair of assets of members of the Group which have been lost, destroyed or damaged, 
     in each case as a result of the events or circumstances giving rise to that Recovery Claim, if those proceeds are so applied as soon as possible (but in any event within 120 days, or such longer period as the Majority Lenders may agree) after receipt. 
           (B) 
    The Company shall prepay Loans, and cancel Available Commitments, in amounts equal to the amount of Acquisition Proceeds at the times and in the order of application contemplated by clause 8.4   (Application of mandatory prepayments and cancellations).

    A prepayment of Loans or cancellation of Available Commitments made under clause 8.3   (Acquisition Proceeds)   shall be applied in the following order: 
              (1) 
    first, in prepayment of Facility B Loans;

              (D) 
    Subject to paragraph (E) below, the Company may elect that any prepayment under clause 8.3   (Acquisition Proceeds)   be applied in prepayment of a Loan on the last day of the Interest Period relating to that Loan. If the Company makes that election then a proportion of the Loan equal to the amount of the relevant prepayment will be due and payable on the last day of its Interest Period. 
              (E) 
    If the Company has made an election under paragraph (D) above but a Default has occurred and is continuing, that election shall no longer apply and a proportion of the Loan in respect of which the election was made equal to the amount of the relevant prepayment shall be immediately due and payable (unless the Majority Lenders otherwise agree in writing).

PART 5:   COSTS OF UTILISATION 
            9.1. 
    Calculation of interest 
     The rate of interest on each Loan for each Interest Period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the: 
           (A) 
    Applicable Margin; and 
              (B) 
    relevant IBOR. 
      The Company to which a Loan has been made shall pay accrued interest on that Loan on the last day of each Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period is longer than six months, on the dates falling at six-monthly intervals after the first day of the Interest Period). 
            (A) 
    Prior to any change in Margin calculated in accordance with paragraph (C) below, the initial Applicable Margin in relation to each Facility A Loan and Facility B Loan shall be 3.25 per cent. per annum and will thereafter be adjusted (upwards or downwards) to the percentage rate per annum specified below opposite the range into which the Senior Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio for the Test Period (as calculated in accordance with the provisions of clause 20   (Financial Covenants)   as shown in the most recent Compliance Certificate, falls. 

43 
    
  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

(B) 
    Prior to any change in Margin calculated in accordance with paragraph (C) below, the initial Applicable Margin in relation to each Facility C Loan shall be 3.10 per cent. per annum and will thereafter be adjusted (upwards or downwards) to the percentage rate per annum specified below opposite the range into which the Senior Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio for the Test Period (as calculated under clause 20   (Financial Covenants)   as shown in the most recent Compliance Certificate, falls. 

(C) 
    Subject to sub-paragraph (D) below, any change in the Applicable Margin will apply to each Loan from and including the fifth Business Day after the date of receipt by the Agent of the relevant Compliance Certificate. 
              (D) 
    For so long: 
              (1) 
    the Company is in default of its obligation under this Agreement to provide a Compliance Certificate; or 
              (2) 
    a Default is outstanding, the Applicable Margin for: 
              (a) 
    a Facility A Loan or a Facility B Loan, will be 3.25 per cent. per annum; and 
              (b) 
    a Facility C Loan, will be 3.10 per cent. per annum. 
     
   44 
    
  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

(E) 
    If, following receipt by the Agent of the annual audited financial statements of the Group and any related Compliance Certificate, those statements and Compliance Certificate show that a higher Applicable Margin should have applied during a certain period, then the Company shall promptly pay to the Agent any amounts necessary to put the Agent and the Lenders in the position they would have been in had the appropriate rate of the Applicable Margin applied during such period. 
              (F) 
    Within three Business Days of the receipt by the Agent of each Compliance Certificate to be delivered under clause 19.2   (Compliance Certificate),   the Agent shall determine the Applicable Margin in relation to each Interest Period commencing after such date of determination (the    Margin Reset Date     )   and continuing until (but excluding) the next Margin Reset Date. 
               (A) 
    If the Company fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which, subject to paragraph (B) below, is one per cent higher than the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration of one Month. Any interest accruing under this clause 9.4 shall be immediately payable by the Company on demand by the Agent. 
              (B) 
    If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Loan which became due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan: 
              (1) 
    the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to that Loan; and 
              (2) 
    the rate of interest applying to the overdue amount during that first Interest Period shall be one per cent. higher than the rate which would have applied if the overdue amount had not become due. 
              (C) 
    Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable. 
              9.5. 
    Notification of rates of interest 
     The Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and the Company of the determination of a rate of interest under this Agreement.

(A) 
    The Company may select an Interest Period for a Loan in the Utilisation Request for a Term Loan or (if the Loan is a Term Loan and has already been borrowed) in a Selection Notice delivered not later than the Specified Time.

    If the Company fails to deliver a Selection Notice to the Agent, the relevant Interest Period will be three Months. 
              (C) 
    Subject to this clause 10, the Company may select an Interest Period of: 
              (1) 
    in relation to either Facility A or Facility B, three or six Months; and 
              (2) 
    in relation to Facility C, one, three or six Months, 
     or any other period agreed between the Company and the Agent (acting on the instructions of all the Lenders) in relation to the relevant Facility. 
           (D) 
    An Interest Period for a Loan shall not extend beyond the Termination Date. The Company may select an Interest Period of less than one Month ending on the relevant Termination Date. 
              (E) 
    Each Interest Period for a Loan shall start on the Utilisation Date or (if already made) on the last day of its preceding Interest Period. 
      If an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day, that Interest Period will instead end on the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not). 
   If two or more Interest Periods: 
           (A) 
    relate to Facility A Loans or to Facility B Loans in the same currency; and 
              (B) 
    end on the same date, those Facility A Loans or Facility B Loans (as relevant) will, unless the Company specifies to the contrary in the Selection Notice for the next Interest Period, be consolidated into, and treated as, a single Facility A Loan or Facility B Loan (as relevant), on the last day of the Interest Period. 
     11.        Changes to the calculation of interest 
   Subject to clause 11.2   (Market disruption),   if any IBOR is to be determined by reference to the Reference Banks but a Reference Bank does not supply a quotation by the Specified Time on the Quotation Day, the applicable IBOR shall be determined on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Reference Banks.

(A) 
    If a Market Disruption Event occurs in relation to a Loan for any Interest Period, then the rate of interest on each Lender s share of that Loan for the Interest Period shall be the rate per annum which is the sum of: 
              (1) 
    the Applicable Margin; and 
              (2) 
    the rate notified to the Agent by that Lender as soon as practicable and in any event before interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest Period, to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to that Lender of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select. 
              (B) 
    In this Agreement    Market Disruption Event    means: 
              (1) 
    at or about noon on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period the relevant IBOR is not available and none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies a rate to the Agent to determine any IBOR for the relevant currency and Interest Period; or 
              (2) 
    before close of business in Stockholm on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period, the Agent receives notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose participations in a Loan exceed 30 per cent. of that Loan) that the cost to it of obtaining matching deposits in the Relevant Interbank Market would be in excess of any IBOR. 
              11.3. 
    Alternative basis of interest or funding 
              (A) 
    If a Market Disruption Event occurs and the Agent or the Company so requires, the Agent and the Company shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than 30 days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest. 
              (B) 
    Any alternative basis agreed pursuant to paragraph (A) above shall, with the prior consent of all the Lenders and the Company, be binding on all Parties. 
               (A) 
    The Company shall, within five Business Days of demand by a Finance Party, pay to that Finance Party its Break Costs attributable to all or any part of a Loan or Unpaid Sum being paid by the Company on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for that Loan or Unpaid Sum. 
              (B) 
    Each Lender shall together with its demand, provide a certificate confirming the amount and basis of calculation of its Break Costs for any Interest Period in which they accrue.

    that Finance Party has obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit,  
     the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Company which that Finance Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Company. 
   The Company shall pay and, within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Finance Party against any cost, loss or liability that Finance Party incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of any Finance Document. 
            (A) 
    All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and accordingly, subject to clause 13.6(B) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document and such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and such Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that Party). 
              (B) 
    If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the    Supplier     )   to any other Finance Party (the    Recipient     )   under a Finance Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the    Relevant Party     )   is required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration): 
              (1) 
    (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT. The Recipient must (where this clause 13.6(B)(1) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and 
              (2) 
    (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT  
     
   52 
    
  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT. 
           (C) 
    Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority. 
              (D) 
    Any reference in this clause 13.6 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to any member of such group which is responsible for accounting for, or paying, VAT on behalf of such group, or on behalf of any or all of the members thereof. 
              (E) 
    In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly provide such Finance Party with details of that Party s VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party s VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply. 
               (A) 
    Subject to paragraph (C) below, each Party shall, within ten Business Days of a reasonable request by another Party: 
              (1) 
    confirm to that other Party whether it is: 
              (a) 
    a FATCA Exempt Party; or 
              (b) 
    not a FATCA Exempt Party; 
              (2) 
    supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party s compliance with FATCA; 
              (3) 
    supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party s compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of information regime. 
              (B) 
    If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (A)(1) above that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly.

    any law or regulation;

    any fiduciary duty; or 
              (3) 
    any duty of confidentiality. 
              (D) 
    If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (A)(1) or (2) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (C) above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information. 
               (A) 
    Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction. 
              (B) 
    Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction)), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall notify the Company, and the Agent and the Agent shall notify the other Finance Parties.

    the introduction or increase in mandatory costs imposed by the federal reserve or a central bank.

    Changes to the lenders 
              23.1. 
    Assignments and transfers by the Lenders 
     Subject to this clause 23, a Lender (the    Existing Lender     )   may: 
           (A) 
    assign any of its rights; or 
              (B) 
    transfer by novation any of its rights and obligations, 
     to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund or other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets (the    New Lender   ). 
           23.2. 
    Conditions of assignment or transfer 
              (A) 
    The consent of the Company is required for an assignment or transfer by an Existing Lender, unless the assignment or transfer is to another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 
              (B) 
    The consent of the Company to an assignment or transfer must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company will be deemed to have given its consent five Business Days after the Existing Lender has requested it unless consent is expressly refused by the Company within that time. 
              (C) 
    If a Lender assigns or transfers part of its participation in the Facilities other than to one of its Affiliates or another Lender the amount of such assignment or transfer must be a minimum of SEK 50,000,000. 
              (D) 
    An assignment will only be effective on: 
              (1) 
    receipt by the Agent (whether in the Assignment Agreement or otherwise) of written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent) that the New Lender will assume the same obligations to the other Finance Parties as it would have been under if it was an Original Lender; and 
              (2) 
    performance by the Agent of all  know your customer  or other checks relating to any person that it is required to carry out in relation to such assignment to a New Lender, the completion of which the Agent shall promptly notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender. 
              (E) 
    A transfer will only be effective if the procedure set out in clause 23.5   (Procedure for transfer)   is complied with. 
              (F) 
    If: 
     
   85 
    
  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

(1) 
    a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office; and 
              (2) 
    as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or change occurs, the Company would be obliged to make a payment to the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under clause 13   (Tax Gross up and Indemnities)   clause 14.1   (Increased Costs), 
     then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled to receive payment under those clauses to the same extent as the Existing Lender or Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred. This clause 23.2(F) shall not apply in respect of any assignment or transfer made in ordinary course of the primary syndication of the Facility. 
           (G) 
    Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes effective in accordance with this Agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender. 
      The New Lender shall, on the date upon which an assignment or transfer takes effect, pay to the Agent (for its own account) a fee of SEK 20,000. 
           23.4. 
    Limitation of responsibility of Existing Lenders 
              (A) 
    Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Lender for: 
              (1) 
    the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the Finance Documents or any other documents; 
              (2) 
    the financial condition of the Company; 
              (3) 
    the performance and observance by the Company of its obligations under the Finance Documents or any other documents; or 
              (4) 
    the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with any Finance Document or any other document,  
     and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded. 
           (B) 
    Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender and the other Finance Parties that it:

              (2) 
    will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Company and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force. 
              (C) 
    Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to: 
              (1) 
    accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights and obligations assigned or transferred under this clause 23; or 
              (2) 
    support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason of the non performance by the Company of its obligations under the Finance Documents or otherwise. 
               (A) 
    Subject to the conditions set out in clause 23.2   (Conditions of assignment or transfer)   a transfer is effected in accordance with paragraph (C) below when the Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

           (3) 
    the Agent, the Bookrunners, the Mandated Lead Arrangers, the New Lender and other Lenders shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between themselves as they would have acquired and assumed had the New Lender been an Original Lender with the rights and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent the Agent, the Bookrunners, the Mandated Lead Arrangers and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each other under the Finance Documents; and

           (A) 
    any charge, assignment or other Security Interest to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central bank; and 
              (B) 
    in the case of any Lender which is a fund, any charge, assignment or other Security Interest granted to any holders (or trustee or representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as security for those obligations or securities,  
     except that no such charge, assignment or Security Interest shall: 
           (1)

    require any payments to be made by the Company other than or in excess of, or grant to any person any more extensive rights than, those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Finance Documents. 
      If the Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a  pro rata basis  to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to clause 23.5   (Procedure for transfer)   or any assignment pursuant to clause 23.6   (Procedure for assignment)   the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):

           (B) 
    the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts, so that, for the avoidance of doubt: 
              (1) 
    when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable to the Existing Lender; and 
              (2) 
    the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this clause 23.9, have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts. 
              24. 
    Assignment and transfers by the Company

    all Lenders if the relevant Finance Document stipulates the matter is an all Lender decision; and 
              (b)

               (A) 
    Each Lender shall (in proportion to its share of the Total Commitments or, if the Total Commitments are then zero, to its share of the Total Commitments immediately prior to their reduction to zero) indemnify the Agent, within three Business Days of demand, against any cost, loss or liability (including, without limitation, for negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever) incurred by the Agent (otherwise than by reason of the Agent s gross negligence or wilful misconduct) (or in the case of any costs, loss or liability pursuant to clause 28.11   (Disruption to payment systems etc)   notwithstanding the Agent s negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever but not including any claim based on the fraud of the Agent) in acting as Agent under the Finance Documents (unless the Agent has been reimbursed by the Company pursuant to a Finance Document).

(B) 
    Alternatively the Agent may resign by giving 30 days  notice to the other Finance Parties and the Company, in which case the Majority Lenders (after consultation with the Company) may appoint a successor Agent. 
              (C) 
    If the Majority Lenders have not appointed a successor Agent in accordance with paragraph (B) above within 20 days after notice of resignation was given, the retiring Agent (after consultation with the Company) may appoint a successor Agent. 
              (D) 
    If the Agent wishes to resign because (acting reasonably) it has concluded that it is no longer appropriate for it to remain as agent and the Agent is entitled to appoint a successor Agent under paragraph (C) above, the Agent may (if it concludes (acting reasonably) that it is necessary to do so in order to persuade the proposed successor Agent to become a party to this Agreement as Agent) agree with the proposed successor Agent amendments to this clause 25 and any other term of this Agreement dealing with the rights or obligations of the Agent consistent with then current market practice for the appointment and protection of corporate trustees together with any reasonable amendments to the agency fee payable under this Agreement which are consistent with the successor Agent s normal fee rates and those amendments will bind the Parties. 
              (E) 
    The retiring Agent shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents. 
              (F)

              (G)

Any successor and each of the other Parties shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have, had if such successor had been an original Party. 
              (H) 
    After consultation with the Company, the Majority Lenders may, by notice to the Agent, require it to resign in accordance with paragraph (B) above. In this event, the Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph (B) above. 
              (I) 
    The Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph (B) above (and, to the extent applicable, shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint a successor Agent pursuant to paragraph (C) above) if on or after the date which is three months before the earliest FATCA Application Date relating to any payment to the Agent under the Finance Documents, either:

(1) 
    the Agent fails to respond to a request under clause 13.7   (FATCA Information)   and a Lender reasonably believes that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date; 
              (2) 
    the information supplied by the Agent pursuant to clause 13.7   (FATCA Information)   indicates that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date; or 
              (3) 
    the Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;  
     and (in each case) a Lender reasonably believes that a Party will be required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if the Agent were a FATCA Exempt Party, and that Lender, by notice to the Agent requires it to resign. 
            (A) 
    After consultation with the Company, the Majority Lenders may, by giving 30 days  notice to the Agent (or, at any time the Agent is an Impaired Agent, by giving any shorter notice determined by the Majority Lenders) replace the Agent by appointing a successor Agent. 
              (B) 
    The retiring Agent shall (at its own cost if it is an Impaired Agent and otherwise at the expense of the Lenders) make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under the Finance Documents. 
              (C) 
    The appointment of the successor Agent shall take effect on the date specified in the notice from the Majority Lenders to the retiring Agent. As from this date, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of this clause 25 (and any agency fees for the account of the retiring Agent shall cease to accrue from (and shall be payable on) that date). 
              (D) 
    Any successor Agent and each of the other Parties shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had been an original Party. 
               (A) 
    In acting as agent for the Finance Parties, the Agent shall be regarded as acting through its agency division which shall be treated as a separate entity from any other of its divisions or departments. 
     
   99 
    
  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

(B) 
    If information is received by another division or department of the Agent, it may be treated as confidential to that division or department and the Agent shall not be deemed to have notice of it. 
               (A) 
    Subject to clause 23.9   (Pro rata interest settlement)   the Agent may treat the person shown in its records as Lender at the opening of business (in the place of the Agent s principal office as notified to the Finance Parties from time to time) as the Lender acting through its Facility Office: 
              (1) 
    entitled to or liable for any payment due under any Finance Document on that day; and 
              (2) 
    entitled to receive and act upon any notice, request, document or communication or make any decision or determination under any Finance Document made or delivered on that day,  
     unless it has received not less than five Business Days  prior notice from that Lender to the contrary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
           (B) 
    Any Lender may by notice to the Agent appoint a person to receive on its behalf all notices, communications, information and documents to be made or despatched to that Lender under the Finance Documents. Such notice shall contain the address, email address, fax number and/or any other information required to enable the sending and receipt of information by that means (and, in each case, the department or officer, if any, for whose attention communication is to be made) and be treated as a notification of a substitute address, email address, fax number, department and officer by that Lender for the purposes of clause 30.3   (Addresses)   and the Agent shall be entitled to treat such person as the person entitled to receive all such notices, communications, information and documents as though that person were that Lender. 
      Without affecting the responsibility of the Company for information supplied by it or on its behalf in connection with any Finance Document, each Lender confirms to the Agent, the Bookrunners and the Mandated Lead Arrangers that it has been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with any Finance Document including but not limited to: 
           (A) 
    the financial condition, status and nature of each member of the Group; 
              (B) 
    the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of any Finance Document and any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document; 
     
   100 
    
  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

(C) 
    whether that Lender has recourse, and the nature and extent of that recourse, against any Party or any of its respective assets under or in connection with any Finance Document, the transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document; and 
              (D) 
    the adequacy, accuracy. and/or completeness of the Information Package and any other information provided by the Agent, any Party or by any other person under or in connection with any Finance Document, the transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document. 
      If a Reference Bank (or, if a Reference Bank is not a Lender, the Lender of which it is an Affiliate) ceases to be a Lender, the Agent shall (in consultation with the Company) appoint another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender to replace that Reference Bank. 
   Any amount payable to the Agent under clause 15.3   (Indemnity to the Agent),   clause 17   (Costs and expenses)   and clause 25.11   (Lenders  indemnity to the Agent)   shall include the cost of utilising the Agent s management time or other resources and will be calculated on the basis of such reasonable daily or hourly rates as the Agent may notify to the Company and the Lenders, and is in addition to any fee paid or payable to the Agent under clause 12   (Fees). 
           25.19. 
    Deduction from amounts payable by the Agent 
     If any Party owes an amount to the Agent under the Finance Documents the Agent may, after giving notice to that Party, deduct an amount not exceeding that amount from any payment to that Party which the Agent would otherwise be obliged to make under the Finance Documents and apply the amount deducted in or towards satisfaction of the amount owed. For the purposes of the Finance Documents that Party shall be regarded as having received any amount so deducted. 
   Each Finance Party confirms that each of the Bookrunners, the Mandated Lead Arrangers and the Agent has authority to accept on its behalf (and ratifies the acceptance on its behalf of any letters or reports already accepted by the Bookrunners, Mandated Lead Arrangers or the Agent) the terms of any reports or letters provided by accountants in connection with the Finance Documents or the transactions contemplated in the Finance Documents and to bind it in respect of those reports or letters and to sign such letters on its behalf and further confirms that it accepts the terms and qualifications set out in such letters.

26. 
    Conduct of business by the Finance Parties 
     No provision of this Agreement will: 
           (A) 
    interfere with the right of any Finance Party to arrange its affairs (tax or otherwise) in whatever manner it thinks fit; 
              (B) 
    oblige any Finance Party to investigate or claim any credit, relief, remission or repayment available to it or the extent, order and manner of any claim; or 
              (C) 
    oblige any Finance Party to disclose any information relating to its affairs (tax or otherwise) or any computations in respect of Tax. 
              27. 
    Sharing among the Finance Parties 
      If a Finance Party (a    Recovering Finance Party     )   receives or recovers any amount from the Company other than in accordance with clause 28   (Payment Mechanics)   and applies that amount to a payment due under the Finance Documents then: 
           (A) 
    the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify details of the receipt or recovery to the Agent; 
              (B) 
    the Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the amount the Recovering Finance Party would have been paid had the receipt or recovery been received or made by the Agent and distributed in accordance with clause 28   (Payment Mechanics),   without taking account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and 
              (C) 
    the Recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent an amount (the    Sharing Payment     )   equal to such receipt or recovery less any amount which the Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Finance Party as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with clause 28.6   (Partial payments). 
      The Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the Company and distribute it between the Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Finance Party) in accordance with clause 28.6   (Partial payments). 
           27.3. 
    Recovering Finance Party s rights 
              (A) 
    On a distribution by the Agent under clause 27.2   (Redistribution of payments),   the Recovering Finance Party will be subrogated to the rights of the Finance Parties which have shared in the redistribution. 
     
   102 
    
  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

(B) 
    If and to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party is not able to rely on its rights under paragraph (A) above, the Company shall be liable to the Recovering Finance Party for a debt equal to the Sharing Payment which is immediately due and payable. 
      If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Finance Party becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Finance Party, then: 
           (A) 
    each Finance Party which has received a share of the relevant Sharing Payment pursuant to clause 27.2   (Redistribution of payments)   shall, upon request of the Agent, pay to the Agent for account of that Recovering Finance Party an amount equal to the appropriate part of its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Finance Party for its proportion of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Finance Party is required to pay); and 
              (B) 
    that Recovering Finance Party s rights of subrogation in respect of any reimbursement shall be cancelled and the Company will be liable to the reimbursing Finance Party for the amount so reimbursed. 
               (A) 
    This clause 27 shall not apply to the extent that the Recovering Finance Party would not, after making any payment pursuant to this clause, have a valid and enforceable claim against the Company. 
              (B) 
    A Recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any amount which the Recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of taking legal or arbitration proceedings, if: 
              (1) 
    it notified that other Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and 
              (2) 
    that other Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in those legal or arbitration proceedings but did not do so as soon as reasonably practicable having received notice and did not take separate legal or arbitration proceedings.

PART 10:   ADMINISTRATION 
             (A) 
    On each date on which the Company or a Lender is required to make a payment under a Finance Document, the Company or Lender shall make the same available to the Agent (unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document) for value on the due date at the time and in such funds specified by the Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment. 
              (B) 
    Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to Euro, in a principal financial centre in a Participating Member State or London) with such bank as the Agent specifies. 
      Each payment received by the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall, subject to clause 28.3   (Distributions the Company)   and clause 28.4   (Clawback)   be made available by the Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the Party entitled to receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify to the Agent by not less than five Business Days  notice with   a   bank in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in the principal financial centre of a Participating Member State or London). 
   The Agent may (with the consent of the Company or in accordance with clause 29 (Set-Off)) apply any amount received by it for the Company in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from the Company under the Finance Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied. 
            (A) 
    Where a sum is to be paid to the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party, the Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum. 
              (B) 
    If the Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to be the case that the Agent had not actually received that amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by the Agent shall on demand refund the same to the Agent together with interest on that amount from the

date of payment to the date of receipt by the Agent, calculated by the Agent to reflect its cost of funds. 
            (A) 
    If, at any time, the Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, the Company or a Lender which is required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Agent in accordance with clause 28.1   (Payments to the Agent)   may instead either pay that amount direct to the required recipient or pay that amount to an interest-bearing account held with an Acceptable Bank and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Company or the Lender making the payment and designated as a trust account for the benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment under the Finance Documents. In each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the Finance Documents. 
              (B) 
    All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account shall be for the benefit of the beneficiaries of that trust account pro rata to their respective entitlements. 
              (C) 
    A Party which has made a payment in accordance with this clause 28.5 shall be discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Finance Documents and shall not take any credit risk with respect to the amounts standing to the credit of the trust account. 
              (D) 
    Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with clause 25.13   (Replacement of the Agent),   each Party which has made a payment to a trust account in accordance with this clause 28.5 shall give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Agent for distribution in accordance with clause 28.2   (Distributions by the Agent). 
               (A) 
    If the Agent receives a payment that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable by the Company under the Finance Documents, the Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations of the Company under the Finance Documents in the following order: 
              (1) 
    first, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid fees, costs and expenses of the Agent under the Finance Documents; 
              (2) 
    secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest, fee or commission due but unpaid under this Agreement; 
              (3) 
    thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due but unpaid under this Agreement; and

  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

(4) 
    fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due but unpaid under the Finance Documents. 
              (B) 
    The Agent shall, if so directed by the Lenders, vary the order set out in paragraphs (A)(2) to (4) above. 
              (C) 
    Paragraphs (A) and (B) above will override any appropriation made by the Company. 
      All payments to be made by the Company under the Finance Documents shall be calculated and be made without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim. 
            (A) 
    Any payment which is due to be made on a day that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the same calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not). 
              (B) 
    During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal or Unpaid Sum under this Agreement interest is payable on the principal or Unpaid Sum at the rate payable on the original due date. 
               (A) 
    Subject to paragraphs (B) to (E) below, the Base Currency is the currency of account and payment for any sum due from the Company under any Finance Document. 
              (B) 
    A repayment of a Loan or Unpaid Sum or a part of a Loan or Unpaid Sum shall be made in the currency in which that Loan or Unpaid Sum is denominated on its due date. 
              (C) 
    Each payment of interest shall be made in the currency in which the sum in respect of which the interest is payable was denominated when that interest accrued. 
              (D) 
    Each payment in respect of costs, expenses or Taxes shall be made in the currency in which the costs, expenses or Taxes are incurred. 
              (E) 
    Any amount expressed to be payable in a currency other than the Base Currency shall be paid in that other currency.

(A) 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if more than one currency or currency unit are at the same time recognised by the central bank of any country as the lawful currency of that country, then: 
              (1) 
    any reference in the Finance Documents to, and any obligations arising under the Finance Documents in, the currency of that country shall be translated into, or paid in, the currency or currency unit of that country designated by the Agent (acting reasonably and after consultation with the Company); and 
              (2) 
    any translation from one currency or currency unit to another shall be at the official rate of exchange recognised by the central bank for the conversion of that currency or currency unit into the other, rounded up or down by the Agent (acting reasonably and after consultation with the Company). 
              (B) 
    If a change in any currency of a country occurs, this Agreement will, to the extent the Agent (acting reasonably and after consultation with the Company) specifies to be necessary, be amended to comply with any generally accepted conventions and market practice in the Relevant Interbank Market and otherwise to reflect the change in currency. 
      If either the Agent determines (in its discretion) that a Disruption Event has occurred or the Agent is notified by the Company that a Disruption Event has occurred:

    any such changes agreed upon by the Agent and the Company shall (whether or not it is finally determined that a Disruption Event has occurred) be binding upon the Parties as an amendment to (or, as the case may be, waiver of) the terms of the Finance Documents notwithstanding the provisions of clause 34   (Amendments and Waivers);

    the Agent shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses whatsoever (including, without limitation for negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever but not including any claim based on the fraud of the Agent) arising as a result of its taking, or failing to take, any actions pursuant to or in connection with this clause 28.11; and 
              (F) 
    the Agent shall notify the Finance Parties of all changes agreed pursuant to paragraph (D) above. 
      A Finance Party may set off any matured obligation due from the Company under the Finance Documents (to the extent beneficially owned by that Finance Party) against any matured obligation owed by that Finance Party to the Company, regardless of the place of payment, booking branch or currency of either obligation. If the obligations are in different currencies, the Finance Party may convert either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the purpose of the set-off.

    Communication when Agent is Impaired Agent 
     If the Agent is an Impaired Agent the Parties may, instead of communicating with each other through the Agent, communicate with each other directly and (while the Agent is an Impaired Agent) all the provisions of the Finance Documents which require communications to be made or notices to be given to or by the Agent shall be varied so that communications may be made and notices given to or by the relevant Parties directly. This provision shall not operate after a replacement Agent has been appointed.

    The Company may satisfy its obligation under this Agreement to deliver any information in relation to those Lenders (the    Website Lenders     )   who accept this method of communication by posting this information onto an electronic website designated by the Company and the Agent (the    Designated Website     )   if: 
              (1) 
    the Agent expressly agrees (after consultation with each of the Lenders) that it will accept communication of the information by this method;

    Calculations and certificates 
      In any litigation or arbitration proceedings arising out of or in connection with a Finance Document, the entries made in the accounts maintained by a Finance Party are prima facie evidence of the matters to which they relate. 
           31.2. 
    Certificates and Determinations 
     Any certification or determination by a Finance Party of a rate or amount under any Finance Document shall set out the basis of calculation in reasonable detail and is, in the absence of manifest error, conclusive evidence of the matters to which it relates. 
   Any interest, commission or fee accruing under a Finance Document will accrue from day to day and is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 360 days or, in any case where the practice in the Relevant Interbank Market differs, in accordance with that market practice. 
   If, at any time, any provision of the Finance Documents is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under any law of any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions nor the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction will in any way be affected or impaired. 
           33. 
    Remedies and waivers 
     No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of any Finance Party, any right or remedy under the Finance Documents shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy prevent any further or other exercise or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. 
           34. 
    Amendments And Waivers    
               (A) 
    Subject to clause 34.2   (Exceptions)   any term of the Finance Documents may be amended or waived only with the consent of the Majority Lenders and the Company and any such amendment or waiver will be binding on all Parties. 
              (B) 
    The Agent may effect, on behalf of any Finance Party, any amendment or waiver permitted by this clause 34. 
     
   112 
    
  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]]

              (3) 
    a reduction in the Applicable Margin or a reduction in the amount of any payment of principal, interest, fees or commission payable;

    clause 2.3   (Finance Parties  rights and obligations),   clause 23   (Changes to the Lenders)   or this clause 34.

              34.3. 
    Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Lenders 
              (A) 
    For so long as a Defaulting Lender has any Available Commitment, in ascertaining the Majority Lenders or whether any given percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of the Total Commitments (or the Total Commitments under the relevant Facilities) or the agreement of any specified group of Lenders has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote under the Finance Documents, that Defaulting Lender s Commitments will be reduced by the amount of its Available Commitments and, to the extent that that reduction results in that Defaulting Lender s Total Commitments being zero, that Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender for these purposes. 
              (B) 
    For the purposes of this clause 34.3, the Agent may assume that the following Lenders are Defaulting Lenders: 
              (1) 
    any Lender which has notified the Agent that it has become a Defaulting Lender; 
              (2)

  [[NYCORP:3601663v1:4555B: 06/10/2016--08:05 PM]] 

(C) 
    unless it has received notice to the contrary from the Lender concerned (together with any supporting evidence reasonably requested by the Agent) or the Agent is otherwise aware that the Lender has ceased to be a Defaulting Lender.

              (1) 
    replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to (and such Lender shall) transfer pursuant to clause 23   (Changes to the Lenders)   all (and not part only) of its rights and obligations under this Agreement; 
              (2) 
    require such Lender to (and such Lender shall) transfer pursuant to clause 23   (Changes to the Lenders)   all (and not part only) of the undrawn Facility C Commitment of the Lender; or

    require such Lender to (and such Lender shall) transfer pursuant to clause 23   (Changes to the Lenders)   all (and not part only) of its rights and obligations in respect of Facility C, 
     to a Lender or other bank, financial institution, trust, fund or other entity (a    Replacement Lender     )   selected by the Company, and which (unless the Agent is an Impaired Agent) is acceptable to the Agent (acting reasonably), which confirms its willingness to assume and does assume all the obligations or all the relevant obligations of the transferring Lender (including the assumption of the transferring Lender s participations or unfunded participations (as the case may be) on the same basis as the transferring Lender) for a purchase price in cash payable at the time of transfer equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender s participation in the outstanding Loans and all accrued interest and/or Break Costs and other amounts payable in relation thereto under the Finance Documents. 
           (B) 
    Any transfer of rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this clause shall be subject to the following conditions: 
              (1)

    the transfer must take place no later than 5 Business Days after the notice referred to in paragraph (A) above; and

      8.2.      Change of control

    If either: 
     (1) (a) after the Effective Date but prior to obtaining Advance Access, Mylan fails to own, directly or indirectly, at least 90 per cent. of the issued share capital or votes in the Company and (b) after obtaining Advance Access, Mylan does not at any time own, directly or indirectly, all the issued share capital or votes in the Company; or

  the Company shall without delay after becoming aware of such occurrence give notice to the Agent thereof. The Agent may (and shall, if instructed by any of the Lenders) for a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of any such notice from the Company, negotiate with the Company with a view to agreeing terms and conditions acceptable to the Company and the Agent for continuing the Facilities. Any agreement in writing between the Agent (acting on the instruction of all Lenders) and the Company reached within 60 days after notice from the Company shall take effect in accordance with its terms. 
           (B) 
    If no such agreement as is referred to in paragraph (A) above is reached within that 60 day period, the Agent shall, at the request of a Lender, by notice to the Company, cancel the Commitments of that Lender and demand repayment of that Lender s participation in all Loans, such repayment to be made on a Business Day not less than 60 days after such notice.

              (3) 
    the Event lasts for fewer than 60 days; and 
              (4) 
    prior to the expiration of such 60 day period, the Foundation exercises its right to acquire and does acquire the issued share capital or votes in Mylan such that the Event that would otherwise constitute a  change of control  under clause 8.2(A)(2) has ceased to exist prior to the end of that 60 day period, 
     the provisions of this clause 8.2 shall cease to apply to the Event.  
           (4) 
    a new clause 21.24 shall be inserted into clause 21 (  General Undertakings  ) of the Agreement as follows:  
        21.24 Mylan Squeeze-Out

  (D) On and from the Effective Date, each of the Lenders hereby waives its rights under the provisions of clause 8.2(B) of the Agreement (in the form in force immediately prior to the Effective Date) which arose as a result of the Mylan Acquisition (including any transfer of the share capital in the Company by and among Mylan and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries that does not breach the provisions of clause 8.2 of the Agreement as amended on and from the Effective Date). For the avoidance of doubt, on and from the Effective Date, the rights of the Lenders under the provisions of clause 8.2(B) of the Agreement as amended by this letter continue in full force and effect. 
  (E) If the Effective Date has not occurred by close of business on or before 01 September, 2016 (or such later date agreed by the Company and the Agent (acting on the instructions of all the Lenders)), the terms of this letter, other than paragraph 8 (Costs), shall cease to have effect.

  [[NYCORP:3619122v1:4472W: 10/03/2016--02:04 PM]] 

(a) 
    the Margin; and 
              (b) 
    STIBOR. 
              8.2 
    Changes to the calculation of interest 
     If (i) at or about noon on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period the Screen Rate is not available and the Lender is unable to provide a quotation to determine STIBOR for the relevant Interest Period or (ii) the cost to the Lender of obtaining matching deposits in the Stockholm interbank market would be in excess of STIBOR, then the rate of interest on the Loan for that Interest Period shall be the percentage rate per annum which is the sum of the Margin and the rate notified to the Borrower by the Lender as soon as practicable and in any event before interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest Period, to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to the Lender of funding the Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select. 
   The Borrower shall pay accrued interest on the Loan on the last day of each Interest Period. 
   If the Borrower fails to pay any amount payable by it under this Agreement on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which is the sum of two (2) per cent. and the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration selected by the Lender (acting reasonably). Any interest accruing under this Clause 8.4 shall be immediately payable by the Borrower on demand by the Lender. Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable. 
   
   The Borrower shall on the earlier to occur of the Utilisation Date and the last day of the Availability Period pay to the Lender an arrangement fee of SEK 4,800,000.

            (a) 
    The Interest Period for the Loan is three (3) months or any other period agreed between the Borrower and the Lender. 
              (b) 
    The first Interest Period shall start on the Utilisation Date and subsequent Interest Periods shall start on the last day of its preceding Interest Period. 
              (c) 
    An Interest Period shall not extend beyond the Termination Date. If an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day, that Interest Period will

              (c) 
    If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by the Borrower, the amount of the payment due from it shall he increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required. 
               (a)

    Clause 11.2(a) shall not apply with respect to any Tax assessed on the Lender under the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which the Lender is incorporated and/or resident for Tax purposes, if that Tax is calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by the Lender, or to the extent a loss, liability or cost is compensated for by an increased payment under Clause 11.1   (Tax gross-up). 
               (a) 
    All amounts set out, or expressed to be payable under this Agreement by the Borrower to the Lender which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for the purposes of value added tax or any other tax of a similar nature ( VAT ) shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on such supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (I   .   )) below, if VAT is chargeable on any supply made by the Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender (in addition to and at the same time as paying the consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (if any) charged thereon.

    Where this Agreement requires the Borrower to reimburse the Lender for any costs or expenses, the Borrower shall also at the same time pay and indemnify the Lender against all VAT incurred by the Lender in respect of the costs or expenses to the extent that the Lender reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of the VAT.

              (c) 
    attributable to the negligent breach by the Lender or its affiliates of any law or regulation; or
