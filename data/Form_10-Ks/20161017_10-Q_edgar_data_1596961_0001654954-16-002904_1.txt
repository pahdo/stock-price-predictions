NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

Basis of presentation 

The
interim financial statements included herein, presented in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles and stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the
Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules
and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures
are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. 

These
statements reflect all material adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management, are
necessary for fair presentation of the information contained
therein. These interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the
year ended November 30, 2015 and notes thereto included in the
Company s annual report. The Company follows the same
accounting policies in the preparation of interim
reports. 

Results
of operations for the interim period are not indicative of annual
results. 

Organization 

The Company was incorporated on October 24, 2013 (Date of
Inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Smart Server,
Inc. 

Nature of operations 

The
Company is a shell company with no current operations. Previously,
the Company was in the process of designing and developing a mobile
payment application. 

Year end 

The
Company s year end is November 30. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less are
considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these
investments approximates fair value. 

Website 

In
connection with its prior operations, the Company capitalized the
costs associated with the development of the proposed website
pursuant to ASC Topic 350.  Other costs related to the
maintenance of the website were expensed as incurred. 
Amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of 3 years
using the straight-line method for financial statement
purposes.   The Company commenced amortization upon
completion of the website, however, the Company is no longer
continuing these operations.  Amortization expense for the
nine months ended August 31, 2016 was $1,425. 

Revenue recognition 

We
recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;
(2) the product or service has been provided to the customer;
(3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or
determinable; and (4) the collection of our fees is
probable. 

The
Company will record revenue when it is realizable and earned and
the services have been rendered to the customers.

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(CONTINUED) 

Advertising costs 

In connection with the Company s prior operations,
advertising costs were expensed as incurred; however there were no
advertising costs included in general and administrative expenses
for the nine months ended August 31, 2016. 

Fair value of financial instruments 

Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market
assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of
August 31, 2016. The respective carrying value of certain
on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair
values. These financial instruments include cash, prepaid expenses
and accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate
carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term
in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or
they are payable on demand. 

Level
1:   The preferred inputs
to valuation efforts are  quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities,  with the caveat that the
reporting entity must have access to that market. Information at
this level is based on direct observations of transactions
involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, and
thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively few items,
especially physical assets, actually trade in active
markets. 

Level
2: FASB acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and
liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist,
they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with
this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second level of
inputs that can be applied in three situations. 

Level
3: If inputs from levels 1 and 2 are not available, FASB
acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and
liabilities are less precise. The board describes Level 3 inputs as
 unobservable,  and limits their use by saying they
 shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that
observable inputs are not available.  This category allows
 for situations in which there is little, if any, market
activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date .
Earlier in the standard, FASB explains that  observable
inputs  are gathered from sources other than the reporting
company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by
market participants. 

Stock-based compensation 

The
Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the
guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718 which requires the Company to
recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock
option awards.  This eliminates accounting for share-based
compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires
instead that such transactions be accounted for using a
fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all
share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting
period of the award.  

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the
receipt of goods or services from other than employees in
accordance with FASB ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by the
FASB ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market
value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of
the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for
consideration other than employee services is determined on the
earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance
by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC
505-50. 

5 

NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(CONTINUED) 

Earnings per share 

The Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for the earnings per
share. Basic earning per common share ( EPS )
calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
year. Diluted earning per common share calculations are determined
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During
periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive
they are not considered in the computation. 

Use of estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ significantly from those
estimates. 

Recent pronouncements 

The
Company has evaluated the recent accounting pronouncements through
October 2016 and believes that none of them will have a material
effect on the company s financial statements. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business. As noted above, the Company is a
shell company with no operations and, accordingly, has not yet
generated revenue from operations. Since its inception, the Company
has been engaged substantially in financing activities and
developing its business plan and incurring start up costs and
expenses. As a result, the Company incurred net losses for the nine
months ended August 31, 2016 of $54,646. In addition, the
Company s previous development activities since inception
were financially sustained through debt and equity
financing. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of
common stock and, ultimately, the achievement of significant
operating revenue. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of
liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. 

NOTE 3   PREPAID EXPENSES 

As of
August 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015, the Company had prepaid
expenses for a prepaid OTC listing fee totaling $5,000 and $0,
respectively. The prepaid OTC listing fees will be expensed on a
straight line basis over the remaining life of the service
period.

On
November 7, 2013, the Company executed a promissory note with a
related party for $20,000. The unsecured note bears interest at 6%

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations 

Overview 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements. Any statements contained herein that are not statements
of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.
The words  believes,   anticipates, 
 plans,   expects,   intends 
and similar expressions identify some of the forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
performance or future results and involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. The factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and
in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, and Current Reports on Form 8-K could also cause actual
results to differ materially from those indicated by the
Company s forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes
no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements, except as required by law. 

Smart
Server was incorporated in the State of Nevada in October of 2013.
In November of 2013 we commenced our previously planned operations
relating to the design and development of a mobile payment
application. These operations have ceased and we have no current
operations and no significant assets. 

Since
our inception on October 24, 2013 through August 31, 2016, we have
not generated any revenue and have accumulated a deficit of
$272,315. Previously, our business activity has focused around the
development of our corporate entity, business plan, marketing
strategy, contact development, website design and the program
writing of our mobile payment solution app. Currently, the Company
is a shell company with no current operations. 

On July
13, 2016, Berrard Holdings Limited Partnership ( Berrard
Holdings ) acquired 5,475,000 shares of common stock (the
 Shares ) of the Company from Pamela Elliott, pursuant
to an Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement, dated July 13,
2016. The Shares acquired by Berrard Holdings represent 99.5% of
the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
Steven R. Berrard has voting and dispositive control over Berrard
Holdings. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended August 31, 2016
and 2015 

Operating
expenses totaled $25,200 during the three months ended August 31,
2016, as compared to $6,359 in the prior year period. In the three
month period ended August 31, 2016, our expenses consisted of legal
and accounting expenses and general and administrative costs
associated with filing of regulatory reports for public reporting
companies, $22,151 represented professional fees, $2,574
represented general and administrative costs, and the remaining
$475 represented depreciation and amortization. The increase in
professional fees is due to the increase in legal work related to
the public filings and for work associated with the change of
control transaction during the three months ended August 31, 2016,
as described above. 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended August 31, 2016 and
2015 

Operating
expenses totaled $47,430 during the nine months ended August 31,
2016, as compared to $28,987 in the prior year period. In the nine
month period ended August 31, 2016, our expenses consisted of legal
and accounting expenses and general and administrative costs
associated with filing of regulatory reports for public reporting
companies, $37,824 represented professional fees, $8,181
represented general and administrative costs, and the remaining
$1,425 represented depreciation and amortization. The increase in
professional fees is mainly due to the increase in legal work
related to the public filings and for work associated with the
change of control transaction during the nine months ended August
31, 2016, described above. 

9 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of
August 31, 2016, the Company has a total of $5,059 in available
cash. If we do not receive additional funds, we will not be able to
continue in business for the next 12 months with our currently
available capital. 

Since
inception, we have financed our cash flow requirements through
equity and debt financing. We may, and most likely will, continue
to experience net negative cash flows from operations. During the
three months ended August 31, 2016, we received debt financing from
a related party totaling $197,358. The convertible debt is due on
July 13, 2026 and bears interest at 6% per annum. The debt is
convertible at the greater of $0.06 per share or 50% of the price
per share in the next qualified offering which is defined as
$500,000. In addition, we have repaid all promissory notes with E.
Venture Resources, Inc., for a total of $158,000. The terms of the
promissory notes provided for an interest rate of 6% per annum with
all accrued balances due and payable within 24 months of the date
of the promissory note. See Notes 4 and 5 for additional
information related to the convertible debt and promissory note. In
the future we anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund
operations through common stock offerings, to the extent available,
or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to
augment our working capital. 

The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the
periods indicated: 

Operating Expenses 

Net
cash used in operating activities was $67,862 for the period ended
August 31, 2016, as compared to $21,942 used in operating
activities for the period ended August 31, 2015. The increase in
net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the
increase in net loss, and the increase in prepaid expenses and an
decrease in accrued interest payable   related
party. 

Financing activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the period ended August
31, 2016 was $71,358, as compared to $28,000 for the period ended
August 31, 2015. The increase in net cash provided by financing
activities was mainly attributable to increased loans from a
related party. 

10 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did
not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources that is material to investors. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We are
an  emerging growth company  under the federal
securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company
reporting requirements. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act
also provides that an  emerging growth company  can
take advantage of the extended transition period provided in
Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or
revised accounting standards. In other words, an  emerging
growth company  can delay the adoption of certain accounting
standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private
companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended
transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be
comparable to those of companies that comply with public company
effective dates. 

Item  3 .    Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 

Not
applicable. 

Item
 4 .    Controls and
Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of
the Company s last fiscal quarter, the Company carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation
was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company s current management, including the
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial
Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), who concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to management, including the
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial
Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints and that management is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their
costs.
