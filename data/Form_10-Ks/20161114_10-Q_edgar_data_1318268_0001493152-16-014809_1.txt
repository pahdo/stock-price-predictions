Note
    1   
        Interim
    Reporting     

While
the information presented in the accompanying interim nine months consolidated financial statements is unaudited, it includes
all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the interim periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as the Company s
December 31, 2015 annual consolidated financial statements. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. It is suggested
that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the Company s December 31, 2015 annual financial statements.
Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected
for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Note
    2   
        Nature
    and Continuance of Operations     

The
Company was incorporated on June 15, 1998 in the State of Nevada, USA and the Company s common shares are publicly traded
on the OTC Bulletin Board.  

Up
until fiscal 2014, the Company was in the business of mineral exploration. On May 28, 2014, the Company formalized an agreement
whereby it purchased assets associated with a smokeless cannabis delivery system. The Company planned to develop this system for
commercial purposes. On December 14, 2014, this asset purchase agreement was terminated.  

On
January 21, 2015, a majority of the Company s stockholders approved a consolidation of the issued and outstanding shares
of common stock, on a 10 for 1 basis, thereby decreasing the issued and outstanding share capital from 113,020,000 to 11,302,000.
 On March 11, 2015, the Company effectively changed its name from Madison Explorations, Inc. to Madison Technologies Inc. and
effected the stock consolidation. These financial statements give retroactive effect to both these changes.  

On
September 16, 2016 the Company entered into an exclusive distribution product license agreement with Tuffy Packs, LLC to distribute
products into the United Kingdom and 43 other countries. The Company will be selling ballistic panels which are personal body
armors, that conforms to the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level IIIA threat requirements. The Company s plan of operations
and sales strategy include online and social media marketing, as well as attending various tradeshows and conferences.  

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to
a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next
twelve months. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements
do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable
operations, has accumulated losses of $540,718 since its inception and expects to incur further losses in the development of its
business, all of which casts substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional
funds by equity financing and/or related party advances. That said, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  

Note
    3   
        Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies     

T  here
has been one addition to accounting policies from those disclosed in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Intangible
assets  

Intangible
assets are non-monetary identifiable assets, controlled by the Company that will produce future economic benefits, based on reasonable
and supportable assumptions about conditions that will exist over the life of the asset. An intangible asset that does not meet
these attributes will be recognized as an expense when it is incurred. Intangible assets that do, are capitalized and initially
measured at cost. Those with a determinable life will be amortized on a systematic basis over their future economic life. Those
with a indefinite useful life shall not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be longer indefinite. An intangible
assets subject to amortization shall be periodically reviewed for impairment. A recoverability test will be performed and, if
applicable, unscheduled amortization is considered.  

A
license agreement has been capitalized and recorded at cost. It will be amortized over the life of the contract, which is two
years.  

Note
    4  
       Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements    

The
Company adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Company as they are issued,
which may be in advance of their effective date. Management does not believe that any pronouncement not yet effective but recently
issued would, if adopted, have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.  

Note
    5

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS  

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be
unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We
expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

Our
net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $35,957 (2015: $46,135), which consisted of general and administration
expenses. We did not generate any revenue during either nine-month period in fiscal 2016 or 2015. The increase in expenses in
the current fiscal year relate to accounting, audit, and legal fees that we have incurred in connection with the filing obligations
with both the SEC and with SEDAR in Canada.  

The
weighted average number of shares outstanding was 11,302,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 11,302,000
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Cash
and Working Capital    

As
at September 30, 2016, Madison had cash of $7,541 and a working capital deficit of $312,421, compared to cash of $501 and working
capital deficit of 265,750 as at December 31, 2015.  

There
are no assurances that Madison will be able to achieve further sales of its common stock or any other form of additional financing.
If Madison is unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue its plan of operations, then Madison will not be able to continue
and its business will fail.  

The
officers and directors have agreed to pay all costs and expenses of having Madison comply with the federal securities laws (and
being a public company, should Madison be unable to do so). Madison s officers and directors have also agreed to pay the
other expenses of Madison, should Madison be unable to do so. To continue its business plan, Madison will need to secure financing
for its business development. Madison currently has no source for funding at this time.  

If
Madison is unable to raise additional funds to satisfy its reporting obligations, investors will no longer have access to current
financial and other information about its business affairs  

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities   

Madison
used cash of $23,960 in operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to cash used of $27,666 in operating
activities during the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in the operating activities was principally a result
of a decrease in operating expenses and a reduction in accounts payable and accruals.  

Net
Cash Provided (Used in) Investing Activities   

Net
cash used in investing activities was $10,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared with cash flow from investing
activities of $nil for the same period in the previous fiscal year.  

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities   

Net
cash flows provided by financing activities were $41,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, from proceeds of a convertible
note payable. Madison generated $25,000 from financing activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2015 from the proceeds
of a note payable and a convertible note.  

Plan
of Operation   

Our
plan of operation is to deliver the Tuffy Pack licensed products into the European and UK retail and wholesale markets via the
use of online market and fulfilment services including but not limited to Amazon.eu, Redstag and MCS Fulfilment. By implementing
these companies  services Madison will be able to establish a reliable supply chain that will receive delivery of the Licensed
Products, warehouse the Licensed Products, package the Licensed Package as per each customer order, and ship the Licensed Products
to the customer efficiently and cost effectively.  

Management
expects to implement Madison s sales distribution strategy beginning in September 2016 and to be operational by December
2016, this includes the following components:  

Payments
to be made under Product License Agreement of $50,000. At the date of this filing Madison has paid $16,500 of the $50,000.  

Madison
sales strategy is to develop online exposure through the use of social media marketing and sending demo packs of the Licensed
Products to both online bloggers and established gun owner clubs. The demo packs will include both new products as well as examples
of the products that have been tested and exposed to gunfire to demonstrate the products effectiveness.  

Management
anticipates incurring the following expenses during the next 12 month period:   

Management
    anticipates spending approximately $2,500 in ongoing general and administrative expenses per month for the next 12 months,
    for a total anticipated expenditure of $30,000 over the next 12 months. The general and administrative expenses for the year
    will consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to Madison s regulatory filings throughout
    the year, as well as transfer agent fees, and general office expenses.   

Management
    anticipates spending approximately $15,000 in complying with Madison s obligations as a reporting company under the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934  and as a reporting issuer in Canada. These expenses will consist primarily of professional
    fees relating to the preparation of Madison s financial statements and completing and filing its annual report, quarterly
    report, and current report filings with the SEC and with SEDAR in Canada.   

As
at September 30, 2016, Madison had cash of $7,541 and a working capital deficit of $312,421 Accordingly, Madison will require
additional financing in the amount of $349.880 in order to fund its obligations as a reporting company under the  Securities
Act of 1934  and its general and administrative expenses for the next 12 months.  

Risk
Factors   

An
investment in Madison s common stock involves a number of very significant risks. Prospective investors should refer to
all the risk factors disclosed in Madison s Form 10-K filed on April 15, 2009.  

Going
Concern   

Madison
has not attained profitable operations and is dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive business activities.
For these reasons Madison s auditors stated in their report that they have substantial doubt Madison will be able to continue
as a going concern.  

Future
Financings   

Management
anticipates continuing to rely on equity sales of Madison s common stock in order to continue to fund its business operations.
Issuances of additional common stock will result in dilution to Madison s existing stockholders. There is no assurance that
Madison will achieve any additional sales of its common stock or arrange for debt or other financing to fund its planned activities.  

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements   

Madison
has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  

Material
Commitments for Capital Expenditures   

At
September 30, 2016 Madison had an outstanding liability of $40,000 owing to Tuffy Packs LLC for the purchase of the Product Licensing
agreement. As of the date of this filing Madison is in arrears $8500 according to the Product Licensing Agreement. Please see
Exhibit 10.5 Product License Agreement dated September 16, 2016 between Tuffy Packs, LLC and Madison Technologies Inc.  

Tabular
Disclosure of Contractual Obligations   

Madison
is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required
under this item.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Madison s
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application
of accounting policies. Management believes that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved
with the following aspects of Madison s financial statements is critical to an understanding of Madison s financial
statements.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. Madison regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions
related to the recovery of long-lived assets, donated expenses and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Madison bases
its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that management believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced
by Madison may differ materially and adversely from Madison s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between
the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

Madison
is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Management
maintains  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the   Exchange Act  ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
Madison s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
Madison s President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

In
connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation
of the President and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Madison s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2016.  

Based
on the evaluation and the identification of the material weaknesses in Madison s internal control over financial reporting,
as described in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, the President and the Chief Accounting Officer concluded that,
as of September 30, 2016, Madison s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes in Madison s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Madison s
internal control over financial reporting.  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures    

Management,
including our President and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that Madison s controls and procedures will prevent
all potential error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
