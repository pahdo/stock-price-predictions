NOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS 
    
  We are a Delaware limited liability company formed by Cheniere (NYSE MKT: LNG) to hold its limited partner interests in Cheniere Partners, a publicly traded limited partnership (NYSE MKT: CQP).  Our only business consists of owning and holding Cheniere Partners  limited partner common units, Class B units   ( Class B units )   and subordinated units   (collectively, the  Cheniere Partners units )  , along with cash or other property that we receive as distributions in respect of such units, and, accordingly, our consolidated operating results and financial condition are dependent on the performance of Cheniere Partners.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   55.9%   limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners.  

NOTE 2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Cheniere Holdings have been prepared in accordance with   GAAP   for interim financial information and with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by   GAAP   for complete financial statements.  In our opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation, have been included.  Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period information to the current presentation.  The reclassifications had no effect on our overall consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.     
    
  Results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that will be realized for the year ending December 31,   2016  .  
    
  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  .  
    
  Accounting for Investment in Cheniere Partners 
    
  As of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we owned a   55.9%   limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners.  In addition to the   Cheniere Partners units  , we own a non-economic voting interest in GP Holdco, which holds a   100%   indirect interest in Cheniere Partners GP.  This non-economic voting interest in GP Holdco allows us to control the appointment of   four   of the   eleven   members to the board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP to oversee the operations of Cheniere Partners.  Cheniere owns the sole share entitled to vote in the election of our directors   (the  Director Voting Share )  .  If Cheniere relinquishes the   Director Voting Share  , which it may do in its sole discretion, or ceases to own greater than   25%   of our outstanding shares, our non-economic voting interest in GP Holdco would be extinguished and we would cease to control GP Holdco.  Cheniere may, at any time and without our consent, relinquish the   Director Voting Share  , which would cause our non-economic voting interest in GP Holdco to be extinguished.  Because Cheniere may relinquish the   Director Voting Share   at any time and we have   no   variable interest in GP Holdco, we have determined that we cannot consolidate Cheniere Partners and must account for our investment in the   Cheniere Partners units   that we own using the equity method of accounting. 
    
  We record our share of Cheniere Partners  net income (loss) in the period in which it is earned.  The difference between our reported   zero   investment in Cheniere Partners as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and our ownership in Cheniere Partners  reported net assets, excluding the beneficial conversion feature associated with the   Class B units   as reported by Cheniere Partners, was due primarily to suspended losses and equity gains from Cheniere Partners  sales of common units that were not recognized by us. 
    
  The equity method of accounting requires that our investment in Cheniere Partners be shown in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as a single amount.  Our initial investment in Cheniere Partners is recognized at cost, and this carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize our share of income or loss of Cheniere Partners after the date of our initial investment in the   Cheniere Partners units  .  As a result of our historical negative investment in Cheniere Partners and because we are not obligated to fund losses, we had a   zero   investment balance in Cheniere Partners as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and had suspended the use of the equity method for additional losses.  After giving effect to our equity ownership in Cheniere Partners as though we had acquired the   Cheniere Partners units   we owned as a result of a merger of entities under common control, we had suspended losses of approximately   $997 million   and   $789 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Additional equity method losses that we incur increase the suspended loss amount.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
  (unaudited) 

Due to our   zero   investment balance in, and suspended losses of, Cheniere Partners as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have historically and will continue to recognize distributions that we receive as a gain on our Consolidated Statements of Income and a corresponding entry will be made to increase the suspended loss account.  Only upon recovery of all suspended losses through future earnings will equity income be reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income and future distributions reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Cheniere Partners.   

NOTE 3 CAPITALIZATION 
    
  Cheniere Holdings  authorized capital structure consists of common shares and the   Director Voting Share  .  No owner of Cheniere Holdings shall be liable for Cheniere Holdings  debts, liabilities or obligations beyond such owner s capital contribution.  At   September 30, 2016  , our issued capitalization consisted of   231.7 million   common shares, of which   185.6 million   common shares were owned by Cheniere and its affiliates and   46.1 million   common shares were owned by the public, and   one     Director Voting Share   owned by Cheniere.  We are authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares.  Additional classes or series of securities may be created with the approval of our Board of Directors, provided that any such additional class or series must be approved by a vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding shares. 

NOTE 4 INVESTMENT IN CHENIERE PARTNERS 
    
  Our business consists of owning the following   Cheniere Partners units  , along with cash or other property that we receive as distributions in respect of such units: 
    
  Common Units     
    
  We own   11,963,488   common units, which are entitled to quarterly cash distributions from Cheniere Partners.  To the extent that Cheniere Partners is unable to pay the initial quarterly distribution in the future, arrearages in the amount of the initial quarterly distribution (or the difference between the initial quarterly distribution and the amount of the distribution actually paid to common unitholders) may accrue with respect to the common units. 
    
  Subordinated Units 
    
  We own   135,383,831   subordinated units.  The subordinated units are not entitled to receive distributions until all common units have received at least the initial quarterly distribution, including any arrearages that may accrue.  The subordinated units will convert on a   one  -for-one basis into common units at the expiration of the subordination period as described in the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Cheniere Partners, dated as of August 9, 2012.  Cheniere Partners has not made any cash distributions in respect of the subordinated units with respect to the quarters ended on or after June 30, 2010.  
    
  Class B Units 
    
  We own   45,333,334     Class B units  .  The   Class B units   are not entitled to receive cash distributions except in the event of a liquidation of Cheniere Partners, a merger, consolidation or other combination of Cheniere Partners with another person or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Cheniere Partners.  The   Class B units   are subject to conversion, mandatorily or at the option of the holders of the   Class B units   under specified circumstances, into a number of common units based on the then-applicable conversion value of the   Class B units  .  On a quarterly basis beginning on the initial purchase date of the   Class B units  , the conversion value of the   Class B units   increases at a compounded rate of   3.5%   per quarter, subject to additional upward adjustment for certain equity and debt financings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the accreted conversion ratio of the   Class B units   owned by us and   Blackstone CQP Holdco   was   1.80   and   1.77  , respectively.  We expect the Class B units to mandatorily convert into common units within   90 days   of the substantial completion date of   Train   3, which we currently expect to be prior to June 30, 2017.  If the   Class B units   are not mandatorily converted by July 2019, the holders of the   Class B units   have the option to convert the   Class B units   into common units at that time.

NOTE 5 SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR CHENIERE PARTNERS 
    
  Our consolidated operating results and financial condition are dependent on the performance of Cheniere Partners.  The following tables are summarized Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets information for Cheniere Partners.  Additional information on Cheniere Partners  operating results and financial position are contained in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , which is included in this filing as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. 

NOTE 6 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
    
  Services Agreement  
    
  We, Cheniere and Cheniere Terminals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere, entered into a services agreement   (the  Services Agreement )   pursuant to which we pay Cheniere a fixed fee of   $1.0 million   per year (payable quarterly in installments of   $250,000   per quarter, in arrears), subject to adjustment for inflation, for certain general and administrative services, including the services of our directors and officers who are also directors and officers of Cheniere.  In addition, we pay directly for, or reimburse Cheniere for, certain third-party general and administrative expenses incurred.  Cheniere also provides us with cash management services, including treasury services with respect to the payment of dividends and allocation of reserves for taxes.  Under the   Services Agreement  , we recorded general and administrative expense affiliate of   $0.3 million   during each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and   $0.8 million   during each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  The   Services Agreement   has a term of   one   year and automatically renews for additional   one  -year terms unless notice of nonrenewal is provided by any party to the agreement at least   90 days   prior to the next renewal date.  Upon the occurrence of certain events resulting in the separation of us and Cheniere, our officers and directors who are also directors and officers of Cheniere would resign.  Within   60 days   after such a separation event, we may provide notice to Cheniere to terminate the   Services Agreement  , and the   Services Agreement   will terminate   90 days   after the delivery date of the notice.  If we provide notice to terminate at any time after such a separation event, we may request that Cheniere continue to provide services to us for a period of up to   six months   from the termination notice date.

CHENIERE ENERGY PARTNERS LP HOLDINGS, LLC  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
  (unaudited) 

Tax Sharing Agreement    
    
  We have entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement   (the  Tax Sharing Agreement )   with Cheniere that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Cheniere and us with respect to tax attributes, tax liabilities and benefits, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and other matters regarding taxes.  Under the terms of the   Tax Sharing Agreement  , for each period in which we or any of our subsidiaries are consolidated or combined with Cheniere for purposes of any tax return, Cheniere will prepare a pro forma tax return for us as if we filed our own consolidated, combined or unitary income tax return, which includes an initial deemed net operating loss   ( NOL )   carryforward amount.  We will be required to reimburse Cheniere for any taxes shown on such pro forma tax returns.  
    
  Although we and Cheniere are each generally responsible for managing those disputes that relate to the taxes for which both are responsible, the   Tax Sharing Agreement   provides that Cheniere will have the responsibility and discretion to prepare and file all consolidated, combined or unitary income tax returns on our behalf (including the making of any tax elections), to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings (including tax audits) relating to such tax returns and to determine the reimbursement amounts in connection with any pro forma tax returns. 

NOTE 7 INCOME TAXES 
    
  We are a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  The provision for income taxes, taxes payable and deferred income tax balances has been recorded as if we had filed all tax returns on a separate return basis ( hypothetical carve-out basis ) from Cheniere.  We are not presently a taxpayer for federal or state income tax purposes and have not recorded a provision for federal or state income taxes in any of the periods included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our taxable income or loss is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Cheniere.  We have entered into a   Tax Sharing Agreement   with Cheniere as discussed in    Note 6 Related Party Transactions.     Any amounts due to Cheniere under the   Tax Sharing Agreement   in excess of our income tax provision calculated on a hypothetical carve-out basis will be recorded as an equity distribution. 
    
  If we separated from the Cheniere consolidated or combined group, our actual   NOL   carryforward may differ from our deemed   NOL   and may be limited by Internal Revenue Code   ( IRC )   Section 382.  Cheniere experienced an ownership change within the provisions of   IRC   Section 382 in 2008, 2010 and 2012.  An analysis of the annual limitation on the utilization of Cheniere s   NOL  s was performed in accordance with   IRC   Section 382.  It was determined that   IRC   Section 382 will not limit the use of our   NOL  s in full over the carryover period.  Cheniere will continue to monitor trading activity in its respective shares which may cause an additional ownership change which could ultimately affect our ability to fully utilize our existing tax   NOL   carryforwards. 

NOTE 8 DISTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED AND DIVIDENDS PAID 
    
  The following provides a summary of distributions received from Cheniere Partners during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

On   October 21, 2016  , the board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP declared a cash distribution of   $0.425   per common unit with respect to the   third   quarter of 2016.  The distribution attributable to our interest in Cheniere Partners, totaling   $5.1 million  , is to be paid to us on   November 11, 2016  .  We have used these distributions from Cheniere Partners to establish cash reserves to pay general and administrative expenses (including affiliate) and to pay dividends.

This standard requires an entity s management to evaluate, for each reporting period, whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued.  Additional disclosures are required if management concludes that conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  Early adoption is permitted.

This guidance changes (1) the identification of variable interests, (2) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination.  This guidance may be early adopted, and may be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.

  This   quarterly   report contains certain statements that are, or may be deemed to be,  forward-looking statements.   All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included herein or incorporated herein by reference are  forward-looking statements.   Because substantially all of our assets consist of our interest in the limited partner interests of Cheniere Partners, many of these statements primarily relate to Cheniere Partners  business.

    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
                
    Recent Accounting Standards 

Our Business 
    
  We are a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Our primary business purpose is to: 
             
    own and hold Cheniere Partners  limited partner common units, Class B units   ( Class B units )   and subordinated units   (collectively, the  Cheniere Partners units )  ; 
                
    pay dividends on our shares from the distributions that we receive from Cheniere Partners, less income taxes and any reserves established by our Board of Directors   (our  Board )   to pay our company expenses and amounts due under our services agreement   (the  Services Agreement )   with a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere, to service and reduce indebtedness that we may incur and for company purposes, in each case as permitted by our limited liability company agreement   ( LLC Agreement )  ; 
                
    simplify tax reporting requirements for investors by issuing a Form 1099-DIV with respect to the dividends received on our shares rather than a Schedule K-1 that would be received as a unitholder of Cheniere Partners; and 
                
    designate members of the board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP to oversee the operations of Cheniere Partners. 
     Our business consists of owning the following   Cheniere Partners units  , along with cash or other property that we receive as distributions in respect of such units: 
    
  Common Units       
    
  We own   11,963,488   common units, which are entitled to quarterly cash distributions from Cheniere Partners.  To the extent that Cheniere Partners is unable to pay the initial quarterly distribution in the future, arrearages in the amount of the initial quarterly distribution (or the difference between the initial quarterly distribution and the amount of the distribution actually paid to common unitholders) may accrue with respect to the common units. 

12 

Subordinated     Units 
    
  We own   135,383,831   subordinated units.  The subordinated units are not entitled to receive distributions until all common units have received at least the initial quarterly distribution, including any arrearages that may accrue.  The subordinated units will convert on a one-for-one basis into common units at the expiration of the subordination period as described in the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Cheniere Partners, dated as of August 9, 2012.  Cheniere Partners has not made any cash distributions in respect of the subordinated units with respect to the quarters ended on or after June 30, 2010.  
    
  Class B Units 
    
  We own   45,333,334     Class B units  .  The   Class B units   are not entitled to receive cash distributions except in the event of a liquidation of Cheniere Partners, a merger, consolidation or other combination of Cheniere Partners with another person or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Cheniere Partners.  The   Class B units   are subject to conversion, mandatorily or at the option of the holders of the   Class B units   under specified circumstances, into a number of common units based on the then-applicable conversion value of the   Class B units  .  On a quarterly basis beginning on the initial purchase date of the   Class B units  , the conversion value of the   Class B units   increases at a compounded rate of   3.5%   per quarter subject to additional upward adjustment for certain equity and debt financings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the accreted conversion ratio of the   Class B units   owned by us and   Blackstone CQP Holdco   was   1.80   and   1.77  , respectively.  We expect the Class B units to mandatorily convert into common units within 90 days of the substantial completion date of Cheniere Partners  Train 3, which we currently expect to be prior to June 30, 2017.  If the   Class B units   are not mandatorily converted by July 2019, the holders of the   Class B units   have the option to convert the Class B units into common units at that time.   
    
  The following table (in thousands) illustrates the number of common units into which the   Class B units   held by us and   Blackstone CQP Holdco   would convert at the dates specified below and our and   Blackstone CQP Holdco   s percentage ownership of then outstanding   Cheniere Partners units  , assuming that none of the outstanding   Class B units   are optionally converted prior to the dates set forth in the table and that no additional limited partner interests are issued by Cheniere Partners prior to such dates: 

(1) 
    This percentage ownership is based solely upon the conversion of   Class B units   and does not include any common units that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by Blackstone Group, an affiliate of Blackstone CQP Holdco.  Based on information from a Schedule 13D/A filed by Blackstone Group and related parties with the SEC on January 15, 2016, Blackstone Group may be deemed to beneficially own 3,758,003 common units. 

Overview of Significant Events  
    
  Our significant accomplishments since January 1,   2016   and through the filing date of this Form 10-Q include the following:   
             
    On September 30, 2016, Cheniere submitted a proposal to our Board to acquire the publicly held shares of us not already owned by Cheniere in a stock for stock exchange.  There can be no assurance that any discussions that may occur between us and Cheniere in connection with the proposal will result in the entry into a definitive agreement concerning a transaction or, if such a definitive agreement is reached, will result in the consummation of a transaction provided for in such definitive agreement. 
                
    In August and September 2016, the Board accepted the resignations of Meg A. Gentle and R. Keith Teague. Cheniere, as holder of the sole share entitled to vote in the election of directors of Cheniere Holdings, appointed Anatol Feygin and Doug Shanda as members of the Board. 

13 

Our Relationship with Cheniere Partners 
    
  We own approximately   55.9%   of the outstanding   Cheniere Partners units  .  As a result of our non-economic voting interest in GP Holdco, which   holds a   100%     interest in Cheniere Partners GP,   we control GP Holdco and indirectly control the appointment of four of the eleven members of the board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP to oversee the operations of Cheniere Partners.  Cheniere owns the sole share entitled to vote in the election of our directors   (the  Director Voting Share )  .  If Cheniere relinquishes the   Director Voting Share  , which it may do in its sole discretion, or ceases to own greater than 25% of our outstanding shares, our non-economic voting interest in GP Holdco would be extinguished and we would cease to control GP Holdco.  Because our only assets are limited partner interests in Cheniere Partners and we are therefore dependent on the operating results and financial condition of Cheniere Partners, we believe that the discussion and analysis of Cheniere Partners  financial condition and operating results is important to our shareholders.  Therefore, Cheniere Partners  quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   has been included in this filing as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference (the  Cheniere Partners Quarterly Report ). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $0.5 million  .  Our capital structure consists only of common shares, of which   185.6 million   shares are owned by Cheniere and   46.1 million   shares are owned by the public, and one   Director Voting Share   which is held by Cheniere.  We are authorized to issue an unlimited number of additional common shares.  Additional classes or series of securities may be created with the approval of our   Board  , provided that any such additional class or series must be approved by a vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding shares.  Our shareholders will not have preemptive or preferential rights to acquire additional common shares or other classes of our securities. 
    
  Cheniere provides certain general and administrative services pursuant to the   Services Agreement  .  We pay a fixed fee of   $1.0 million   per year (payable quarterly in installments of   $250,000   per quarter, in arrears), subject to adjustment for inflation, for certain general and administrative services, including the services of our directors and officers who are also directors and executive officers of Cheniere.  In addition, we pay directly for, or reimburse Cheniere for, certain third-party general and administrative expenses incurred.  Cheniere also provides us with cash management services, including treasury services with respect to the payment of dividends and allocation of reserves for taxes.  Under the   Services Agreement  , we recorded general and administrative expense affiliate of   $0.3 million   during each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and   $0.8 million   during each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  We believe that the cash distributions we will receive on the   Cheniere Partners units   will be sufficient to fund fees and expenses due under the   Services Agreement   and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months.   
    
  Dividends 
    
  Our   LLC Agreement   requires us to pay dividends on our shares equal to the amount of cash that we receive as distributions in respect of the   Cheniere Partners units   that we own, less income taxes and reserves established by our   Board  .  See    Note 8 Distributions Received and Dividends Paid    of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of dividends paid by us during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

14 

Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  The following table (in thousands) summarizes the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  Additional discussion of these items follows the table. 

Operating Cash Flows 
    
  Operating cash flows during each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $1.8 million  , primarily as a result of the payment of general and administrative expenses (including affiliate). 
    
  Investing Cash Flows 
    
  Investing cash flows during each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $15.3 million  , as a result of distributions from Cheniere Partners. 
    
  Financing Cash Flows 
    
  Financing cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $13.9 million   and   $13.8 million  , respectively, primarily as a result of dividends paid to our common shareholders in accordance with our   LLC Agreement   as described above. 

Results of Operations 
    
  Equity Income from Investment in Cheniere Partners  
    
  We use the equity method of accounting for our limited partner ownership interest in Cheniere Partners.  The equity method of accounting requires that our investment in Cheniere Partners be shown in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as a single amount.  Our initial investment in Cheniere Partners was recognized at cost, and this carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize our share of income or loss of Cheniere Partners after the date of our initial investment in the   Cheniere Partners units  .  As a result of our historical negative investment in Cheniere Partners and because we are not obligated to fund losses, we had a zero investment balance in Cheniere Partners recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and had suspended the use of the equity method for any additional losses.  The suspended loss account will be increased or decreased by our share of Cheniere Partners  future losses or earnings, respectively.  We had suspended losses of approximately   $997 million   and   $789 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Due to our zero investment balance in, and suspended losses of, Cheniere Partners as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we have historically and will continue to recognize distributions that we receive as a gain on our Consolidated Statements of Income and a corresponding entry will be made to increase the suspended loss account.  Once we have recovered all suspended losses through our share of Cheniere Partners  future earnings, the equity income or loss from our share of Cheniere Partners  future earnings will be reported on our income statements.  In addition, future distributions we receive from Cheniere Partners would then reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Cheniere Partners.  We recognized   $5.1 million   for each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and  

15 

2015   and   $15.3 million   for each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   of equity income from our investment in Cheniere Partners resulting from quarterly distributions that Cheniere Partners paid to us.  
    
  The following table summarizes Consolidated   Statements of Operations   information for Cheniere Partners.  Additional information on Cheniere Partners  operating results and financial position are contained in the Cheniere Partners Quarterly Report.  

General and Administrative Expenses (including affiliate) 
    
  Our general and administrative expenses (including affiliate) are associated with managing our business and affairs.  We incurred total general and administrative expenses (including affiliate) of   $0.7 million   and   $0.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   $2.0 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.  These expenses included   $0.3 million   for each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and   $0.8 million   for each of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   related to services provided by Cheniere under the Services Agreement necessary for the conduct of our business, such as accounting, legal, tax, information technology and other expenses. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no transactions that met the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial position or operating results.  

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes.  There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  

Recent Accounting Standards 
    
  For descriptions of recently issued accounting standards, see    Note 9 Recent Accounting Standards    of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
       
  The nature of our business and operations is such that no activities or transactions are conducted or entered into by us that would require us to have a discussion under this item. 
    
  For a discussion of these matters as they pertain to Cheniere Partners, please read Part II, Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  in the Cheniere Partners Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , which is included in this filing as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference, as activities of Cheniere Partners have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
       
  We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed by us under the   Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended     (the  Exchange Act )  , is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the   Exchange Act  .  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
    
  During the most recent fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

17

ITEM 1.    
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
       
  We may in the future be involved as a party to various legal proceedings, which are incidental to the ordinary course of business.  We regularly analyze current information and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters.  In the opinion of management, as of   September 30, 2016  , there were no pending legal matters that would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results, financial position or cash flows.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 

NOTE 1 BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of Cheniere Partners have been prepared in accordance with   GAAP   for interim financial information and with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by   GAAP   for complete financial statements.  In our opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation, have been included.  Certain reclassifications have been made to conform prior period information to the current presentation.  The reclassifications had no effect on our overall consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows.  
    
  In 2016, we started production at our natural gas liquefaction facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana   (the  Liquefaction Project )  .  As a result, we introduced a new line item entitled  cost of sales  and modified the components of activity included in  operating and maintenance expense  on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  To conform to the new presentation, reclassifications were made to the prior periods.  Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly for the production and delivery of LNG from the   Liquefaction Project   such as natural gas feedstock, variable transportation and storage costs, derivative gains and losses associated with economic hedges to secure natural gas feedstock for the   Liquefaction Project  , and other related costs to convert natural gas into LNG, all to the extent not utilized for the commissioning process.  These costs were reclassified from operating and maintenance expense.  Operating and maintenance expense now includes costs associated with operating and maintaining the   Liquefaction Project   such as third-party service and maintenance contract costs, payroll and benefit costs of operations personnel, natural gas transportation and storage capacity demand charges, derivative gains and losses related to the sale and purchase of LNG associated with the regasification terminal, insurance and regulatory costs.   
    
  Additionally, we distinguished and reclassified our historical  revenues  line item into  regasification revenues  and  LNG revenues.   Regasification revenues include LNG regasification capacity reservation fees that are received pursuant to our TUAs and tug services fees that are received by Sabine Pass Tug Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLNG.  Substantially all of our regasification revenues are received from our   two   long-term TUA customers.  LNG revenues include fees that are received pursuant to our SPAs and related LNG marketing activities.  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received   70%   and   77%  , respectively, of our net LNG revenues from   one   SPA customer. 
    
  Results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that will be realized for the year ending December 31,   2016  .  
    
  We are not subject to either federal or state income tax, as our partners are taxed individually on their allocable share of our taxable income. 
    
  For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  

NOTE 2 UNITHOLDERS  EQUITY  
    
  The common units, Class B units and subordinated units represent limited partner interests in us.  The holders of the units are entitled to participate in partnership distributions and exercise the rights and privileges available to limited partners under our partnership agreement.  Our partnership agreement requires that, within   45 days   after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement).  Generally, our available cash is our cash on hand at the end of a quarter less the amount of any reserves established by our general partner.  All distributions paid to date have been made from operating surplus as defined in the partnership agreement.   
    
  The holders of common units have the right to receive initial quarterly distributions of   $0.425   per common unit, plus any arrearages thereon, before any distribution is made to the holders of the subordinated units.  The holders of subordinated units will receive distributions only to the extent we have available cash above the initial quarterly distribution requirement for our common unitholders and general partner and certain reserves.  Subordinated units will convert into common units on a one-for-one basis when we meet financial tests specified in the partnership agreement.  Although common and subordinated unitholders are not obligated to fund losses of the Partnership, their capital accounts, which would be considered in allocating the net assets of the Partnership were it to be liquidated, continue to share in losses.

CHENIERE ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES    
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
  (unaudited) 

The general partner interest is entitled to at least   2%   of all distributions made by us.  In addition, the general partner holds incentive distribution rights   ( IDRs )  , which allow the general partner to receive a higher percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the initial quarterly distributions have been achieved and as additional target levels are met.  The higher percentages range from   15%   to   50%  . 
    
  During 2012,   Blackstone CQP Holdco   and Cheniere completed their purchases of a new class of equity interests representing limited partner interests in us   ( Class B units )   for total consideration of   $1.5 billion   and   $500.0 million  , respectively.  Proceeds from the financings were used to fund a portion of the costs of developing, constructing and placing into service the first   two     Train  s of the   Liquefaction Project  .  In May 2013, Cheniere purchased an additional   12.0 million     Class B units   for consideration of   $180.0 million   in connection with our acquisition of CTPL and Cheniere Pipeline GP Interests, LLC.  In 2013, Cheniere formed Cheniere Holdings to hold its limited partner interests in us.  The   Class B units   are subject to conversion, mandatorily or at the option of the Class B unitholders under specified circumstances, into a number of common units based on the then-applicable conversion value of the   Class B units  .  The   Class B units   are not entitled to cash distributions except in the event of our liquidation or a merger, consolidation or other combination of us with another person or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.  On a quarterly basis beginning on the date of the initial purchase date of the   Class B units  , the conversion value of the   Class B units   increases at a compounded rate of   3.5%   per quarter, subject to additional upward adjustment for certain equity and debt financings.  The accreted conversion ratio of the Class B units owned by Cheniere Holdings and   Blackstone CQP Holdco   was   1.80   and   1.77  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  .  We expect the Class B units to mandatorily convert into common units within   90 days   of the substantial completion date of Train 3 of the   Liquefaction Project  , which we currently expect to occur before June 30, 2017.  If the   Class B units   are not mandatorily converted by July 2019, the holders of the   Class B units   have the option to convert the   Class B units   into common units at that time.  

NOTE 3 RESTRICTED CASH 
    
  Restricted cash consists of funds that are contractually restricted as to usage or withdrawal and have been presented separately from cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):  

Under the indentures governing the senior notes issued by SPLNG   (the  SPLNG Indentures )  , except for permitted tax distributions, SPLNG may not make distributions until certain conditions are satisfied, including: (1) there must be on deposit in an interest payment account an amount equal to   one  -sixth of the semi-annual interest payment multiplied by the number of elapsed months since the last semi-annual interest payment, and (2) there must be on deposit in a permanent debt service reserve fund an amount equal to   one   semi-annual interest payment.  Distributions are permitted only after satisfying the foregoing funding requirements, a fixed charge coverage ratio test of   2  :1 and other conditions specified in the   SPLNG Indentures  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , SPLNG made distributions of   $230.4 million   and   $267.9 million  , respectively, after satisfying all the applicable conditions in the   SPLNG Indentures  . 
    
  In February 2016, we entered into a   $2.8 billion   credit facility   (the  2016 CQP Credit Facilities )  .  We, and Cheniere Investments and CTPL as our guarantor subsidiaries, are subject to limitations on the use of cash under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   and the related depositary agreement governing the extension of credit to us.   Specifically, we, Cheniere Investments and CTPL may only withdraw funds from collateral accounts held at a designated depositary bank on a monthly basis and for specific purposes, including for the payment of operating expenses.  In addition, distributions and capital expenditures may only be made quarterly and are subject to certain restrictions.

NOTE 4 ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , accounts and other receivables consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Pursuant to the accounts agreement entered into with the collateral trustee for the benefit of SPL s debt holders, SPL is required to deposit all cash received into reserve accounts controlled by the collateral trustee.  The usage or withdrawal of such cash is restricted to the payment of liabilities related to the   Liquefaction Project   and other restricted payments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the entire balance of the SPL trade receivable was from a single SPA customer. 

NOTE 5 INVENTORY  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): 

NOTE 6 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  
    
  Property, plant and equipment consists of LNG terminal costs and fixed assets, as follows (in thousands): 

During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we realized offsets to LNG terminal costs of   $58.7 million   and   $201.0 million  , respectively, that were related to the sale of commissioning cargoes because these amounts were earned prior to the start of commercial operations, during the testing phase for the construction of Trains 1 and 2 of the   Liquefaction Project  .

NOTE 7 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
    
  We have entered into the following derivative instruments that are reported at fair value: 
             
    interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating-rate interest payments under certain of our credit facilities   ( Interest Rate Derivatives )  ; 
                
    commodity derivatives consisting of natural gas supply contracts for the commissioning and operation of the   Liquefaction Project     ( Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives )   and associated economic hedges   ( Financial Liquefaction Supply Derivatives , and collectively with the Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives, the  Liquefaction Supply Derivatives )  ; and 
                
    commodity derivatives to hedge the exposure to price risk attributable to future: (1) sales of our LNG inventory and (2) purchases of natural gas to operate the Sabine Pass LNG terminal   ( Natural Gas Derivatives )  . 
     None of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedging instruments, and changes in fair value are recorded within our Consolidated   Statements of Operations  . 
    
  SPLNG has elected to account for a portion of the   Natural Gas Derivatives   as normal purchase normal sale transactions, exempt from fair value accounting.  Gains and losses for these physical hedges are not reflected on our Consolidated   Statements of Operations   until the period of delivery.  SPLNG had not posted collateral for such forward contracts as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The following table (in thousands) shows the fair value of our derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which are classified as   other current assets  ,   non-current derivative assets  ,   derivative liabilities   or non-current derivative liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

We value our   Interest Rate Derivatives   using valuations based on the initial trade prices.  Using an income-based approach, subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rate curves, risk adjusted discount rates, credit spreads and other relevant data.  The estimated fair values of our   Natural Gas Derivatives   are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged currently between willing parties.  We value these derivatives using observable commodity price curves and other relevant data.   
    
  The fair value of substantially all of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   is developed through the use of internal models which are impacted by inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace.  As a result, the fair value of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.  The curves used to generate the fair value of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   are based on basis adjustments applied to forward curves for a liquid trading point.  In addition, there may be observable liquid market basis information in the near term, but terms of a particular   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   contract may exceed the period for which such information is available, resulting in a Level 3 classification.  In these instances, the fair value of the contract incorporates extrapolation assumptions made in the determination of the market basis price for future delivery periods in which applicable commodity basis prices were either not observable or lacked corroborative market data.  Internal fair value models include conditions precedent to the respective long-term natural gas supply contracts.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , some of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   existed within markets for which the pipeline infrastructure is under development to accommodate marketable physical gas flow.  Accordingly, our internal

fair value models are based on market prices that equate to our own contractual pricing due to: (1) the inactive and unobservable market and (2) conditions precedent and their impact on the uncertainty in the timing of our actual receipt of the physical volumes associated with each forward.  The fair value of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   is predominantly driven by market commodity basis prices and our assessment of the associated conditions precedent, including evaluating whether the respective market is available as pipeline infrastructure is developed.  Upon the completion and placement into service of relevant pipeline infrastructure to accommodate marketable physical gas flow, we recognize a gain or loss based on the fair value of the respective natural gas supply contracts as of the reporting date.  
    
  As all of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   are either purely index-priced or index-priced with a fixed basis, we do not believe that a significant change in market commodity prices would have a material impact on our Level 3 fair value measurements.  The following table includes quantitative information for the unobservable inputs for our Level 3   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   as of   September 30, 2016  :

  Liquefaction Supply Derivatives    
    
  SPL has entered into index-based physical natural gas supply contracts and associated economic hedges to purchase natural gas for the commissioning and operation of the   Liquefaction Project  .  The terms of the physical natural gas supply contracts primarily range from approximately   one   to   seven   years and commence upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including but not limited to the date of first commercial operation of specified Trains of the   Liquefaction Project  .  We recognize our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   are reported in earnings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , SPL has secured up to approximately   1,982.0 million     MMBtu   of natural gas feedstock through natural gas supply contracts.  The notional natural gas position of our   Physical Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   was approximately   1,069.0 million     MMBtu   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Our   Financial Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   are executed through over-the-counter contracts which are subject to nominal credit risk as these transactions are settled on a daily margin basis with investment grade financial institutions.  We are required by these financial institutions to use margin deposits as credit support for our   Financial Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   activities.

    Must be redeemed or repaid concurrently with the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   if the obligations under the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   are satisfied with borrowings under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .  See    Note 15 Subsequent Events    for additional details about the redemption of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  . 
              (2) 
    Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, which require debt issuance costs related to term notes to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, rather than as an asset, retrospectively for each reporting period presented.  As a result, we reclassified   $160.4 million   and   $2.8 million   from debt issuance costs, net to long-term debt, net and current debt, net, respectively, as of   December 31, 2015  .

incremental interest required under the respective senior notes during construction.  The net proceeds were used to prepay a portion (for the   2026 SPL Senior Notes  ) or all (for the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  ) of the outstanding borrowings and terminate commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  , resulting in a write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   of   $25.8 million   and   $51.8 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.   The remaining proceeds from the   2027 SPL Senior Notes   are being used to pay a portion of the capital costs in connection with the construction of Trains 1 through 5 of the   Liquefaction Project   in lieu of the terminated portion of the commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  .  The   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and   2027 SPL Senior Notes   accrue interest at fixed rates of   5.875%   and   5.00%  , respectively, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears.  The terms of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and   2027 SPL Senior Notes   are governed by the same common indenture as the other senior notes of SPL, which contains customary terms and events of default, covenants and redemption terms. 
    
  In connection with the issuance of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  , SPL entered into registration rights agreements   (the  SPL Registration Rights Agreements )  .  Under the terms of the   SPL Registration Rights Agreements  , SPL has agreed, and any future guarantors will agree, to use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and cause to become effective registration statements relating to offers to exchange any and all of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and   2027 SPL Senior Notes   for like aggregate principal amounts of debt securities of SPL with terms identical in all material respects to the respective senior notes sought to be exchanged (other than with respect to restrictions on transfer or to any increase in annual interest rate), within   360 days   after June 14, 2016 and September 23, 2016, respectively.  Under specified circumstances, SPL has also agreed, and any future guarantors will also agree, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective shelf registration statements relating to resales of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  .  SPL will be obligated to pay additional interest on these senior notes if it fails to comply with its obligation to register them within the specified time period. 
    
  2016 CQP Credit Facilities 
    
  In February 2016, we entered into the   $2.8 billion     2016 CQP Credit Facilities  , which consist of: (1) a   $450.0 million   CTPL tranche term loan that was used to prepay the   $400.0 million     CTPL Term Loan   in February 2016, (2) an approximately   $2.1 billion   SPLNG tranche term loan that will be used to redeem or repay the approximately   $2.1 billion   of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   and the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   (which must be redeemed or repaid concurrently under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   ), (3) a   $125.0 million   debt service reserve credit facility   (the  DSR Facility )   that may be used to satisfy a   six  -month debt service reserve requirement and (4) a   $115.0 million   revolving credit facility that may be used for general business purposes.  
    
  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   accrue interest at a variable rate per annum equal to   LIBOR or the base rate   (equal to the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus   0.50%   and adjusted one month LIBOR plus   1.0%  ), plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin for LIBOR loans is   2.25%   per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans is   1.25%   per annum, in each case with a   0.50%   step-up beginning on February 25, 2019.  Interest on LIBOR loans is due and payable at the end of each applicable LIBOR period (and at the end of every three month period within the LIBOR period, if any), and interest on base rate loans is due and payable at the end of each calendar quarter.  
    
  We incurred   $48.7 million   of debt issuance costs as of   September 30, 2016  , and will incur an additional   $21.5 million   of debt issuance costs when the SPLNG tranche is funded.  The prepayment of the   CTPL Term Loan   resulted in a write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of   $1.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  We pay a commitment fee equal to an annual rate of   40%   of the margin for LIBOR loans multiplied by the average daily amount of the undrawn commitment, payable quarterly in arrears.  The   DSR Facility   and the revolving credit facility are both available for the issuance of letters of credit, which incur a fee equal to an annual rate of   2.25%   of the undrawn portion with a   0.50%   step-up beginning on February 25, 2019.   
    
  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   mature on February 25, 2020, and the outstanding balance may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, except for interest hedging and interest rate breakage costs.  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   contain conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and limit our ability to make restricted payments, including distributions, to once per fiscal quarter as long as certain conditions are satisfied.  Under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  , we are required to hedge not less than   50%   of the variable interest rate exposure on its projected aggregate outstanding balance, maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of at least   1.15  x at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning March 31, 2019 and have a projected debt service coverage ratio of   1.55  x in order to incur additional indebtedness to refinance a portion of the existing obligations.

LNG Terminal Capacity Agreements 
    
  Terminal Use Agreements 
    
  SPL obtained approximately   2.0     Bcf/d   of regasification capacity under a   TUA   with SPLNG as a result of an assignment in July 2012 by Cheniere Investments of its rights, title and interest under its   TUA   with SPLNG.  SPL is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately   $250 million   per year   (the  TUA Fees )  , continuing until at least   20 years   after SPL delivers its first commercial cargo at the   Liquefaction Project  . 
    
  In connection with this   TUA  , SPL is required to pay for a portion of the cost (primarily LNG inventory) to maintain the cryogenic readiness of the regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, which is recorded as operating and maintenance expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Cheniere Investments, SPL and SPLNG entered into the terminal use rights assignment and agreement   (the  TURA )   pursuant to which Cheniere Investments has the right to use SPL s reserved capacity under the   TUA   and has the obligation to pay the   TUA Fees   required by the   TUA   to SPLNG.  However, the revenue earned by SPLNG from the   TUA Fees   and the loss incurred by Cheniere Investments under the   TURA   are eliminated upon consolidation of our Financial Statements.  We have guaranteed the obligations of SPL under its   TUA   and the obligations of Cheniere Investments under the   TURA  . 
    
  In an effort to utilize Cheniere Investments  reserved capacity under the   TURA   during construction of the   Liquefaction Project  , Cheniere Marketing has entered into an amended and restated variable capacity rights agreement with Cheniere Investments   (the  Amended and Restated VCRA )   pursuant to which Cheniere Marketing is obligated to pay Cheniere Investments   80%   of the expected gross margin of each cargo of LNG that Cheniere Marketing arranges for delivery to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.

Agreement to Fund SPLNG s Cooperative Endeavor Agreements   ( CEAs )    
    
  SPLNG has executed   CEAs   with various Cameron Parish, Louisiana taxing authorities that allowed them to collect certain annual property tax payments from SPLNG from 2007 through 2016.  This   ten  -year initiative represented an aggregate commitment of   $24.5 million   in order to aid in their reconstruction efforts following Hurricane Rita, which SPLNG fulfilled its obligations in the first quarter of 2016.  In exchange for SPLNG s advance payments of annual ad valorem taxes, Cameron Parish will grant SPLNG a dollar-for-dollar credit against future ad valorem taxes to be levied against the Sabine Pass LNG terminal starting in 2019.  Beginning in September 2007, SPLNG entered into various agreements with Cheniere Marketing, pursuant to which Cheniere Marketing would pay SPLNG additional   TUA   revenues equal to any and all amounts payable by SPLNG to the Cameron Parish taxing authorities under the   CEAs  .  In exchange for such amounts received as TUA revenues from Cheniere Marketing, SPLNG will make payments to Cheniere Marketing equal to, and in the year the Cameron Parish dollar-for-dollar credit is applied against, ad valorem tax levied on our LNG terminal. 
    
  On a consolidated basis, these advance tax payments were recorded to other non-current assets, and payments from Cheniere Marketing that SPLNG utilized to make the ad valorem tax payments were recorded as a long-term obligation.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $24.5 million   and   $22.1 million  , respectively, of both other non-current assets resulting from SPLNG s ad valorem tax payments and non-current liabilities affiliate resulting from these payments received from Cheniere Marketing.   
    
  Contracts for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas and LNG 
    
  SPLNG is able to sell and purchase natural gas and LNG under agreements with Cheniere Marketing.  Under these agreements, SPLNG purchases natural gas or LNG from Cheniere Marketing at a sales price equal to the actual purchase price paid by Cheniere Marketing to suppliers of the natural gas or LNG, plus any third-party costs incurred by Cheniere Marketing with respect to the receipt, purchase and delivery of natural gas or LNG to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.  
    
  Tug Boat Lease Sharing Agreement 
    
  In connection with its tug boat lease,   Sabine Pass Tug Services, LLC   (   Tug Services   ), a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLNG, entered into a tug sharing agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of Cheniere to provide its LNG cargo vessels with tug boat and marine services at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.  
    
  LNG Terminal Export Agreement 
    
  In January 2010, SPLNG and Cheniere Marketing entered into an LNG Terminal Export Agreement that provides Cheniere Marketing the ability to export LNG from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.  SPLNG did   no  t record any revenues associated with this agreement during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  State Tax Sharing Agreements 
    
  In November 2006, SPLNG entered into a state tax sharing agreement with Cheniere.  Under this agreement, Cheniere has agreed to prepare and file all state and local tax returns which SPLNG and Cheniere are required to file on a combined basis and to timely pay the combined state and local tax liability.  If Cheniere, in its sole discretion, demands payment, SPLNG will pay to Cheniere an amount equal to the state and local tax that SPLNG would be required to pay if its state and local tax liability were calculated on a separate company basis.  There have been   no   state and local taxes paid by Cheniere for which Cheniere could have demanded payment from SPLNG under this agreement; therefore, Cheniere has not demanded any such payments from SPLNG.  The agreement is effective for tax returns due on or after January 1, 2008. 
    
  In August 2012, SPL entered into a state tax sharing agreement with Cheniere.  Under this agreement, Cheniere has agreed to prepare and file all state and local tax returns which SPL and Cheniere are required to file on a combined basis and to timely pay the combined state and local tax liability.  If Cheniere, in its sole discretion, demands payment, SPL will pay to Cheniere an amount equal to the state and local tax that SPL would be required to pay if SPL s state and local tax liability were calculated on a separate company basis.  There have been   no   state and local taxes paid by Cheniere for which Cheniere could have demanded payment from SPL under this agreement; therefore, Cheniere has not demanded any such payments from SPL.  The agreement is effective for tax returns due on or after August 2012.

NOTE 12 NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON UNIT 
    
  Net income (loss) per common unit for a given period is based on the distributions that will be made to the unitholders with respect to the period plus an allocation of undistributed net income (loss) based on provisions of the partnership agreement, divided by the weighted average number of common units outstanding.  Distributions paid by us are presented on the Consolidated Statement of Partners  Equity.  On   October 21, 2016  , we declared a   $0.425   distribution per common unit and the related distribution to our general partner to be paid on   November 11, 2016   to unitholders of record as of   November 1, 2016   for the period from   July 1, 2016   to   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The two-class method dictates that net income (loss) for a period be reduced by the amount of available cash that will be distributed with respect to that period and that any residual amount representing undistributed net income be allocated to common unitholders and other participating unitholders to the extent that each unit may share in net income as if all of the net income for the period had been distributed in accordance with the partnership agreement.  Undistributed income is allocated to participating securities based on the distribution waterfall for available cash specified in the partnership agreement.  Undistributed losses (including those resulting from distributions in excess of net income) are allocated to common units and other participating securities on a pro rata basis based on provisions of the partnership agreement.  Historical income (loss) attributable to a company that was purchased from an entity under common control is allocated to the predecessor owner in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement.  Distributions are treated as distributed earnings in the computation of earnings per common unit even though cash distributions are not necessarily derived from current or prior period earnings.  
    
  The   Class B units   were issued at a discount to the market price of the common units into which they are convertible.  This discount, totaling   $2,130.0 million  , represents a beneficial conversion feature and is reflected as an increase in common and subordinated unitholders  equity and a decrease in Class B unitholders  equity to reflect the fair value of the   Class B units   at issuance on our Consolidated Statement of Partners  Equity.  The beneficial conversion feature is considered a dividend that will be distributed ratably with respect to any Class B unit from its issuance date through its conversion date, resulting in an increase in Class B unitholders  equity and a decrease in common and subordinated unitholders  equity.  We amortize the beneficial conversion feature assuming a conversion date of August 2017 for Cheniere Holdings  and   Blackstone CQP Holdco   s   Class B units  , although actual conversion may occur prior to or after these assumed dates.  We are amortizing using the effective yield method with a weighted average effective yield of   888.7%   per year and   966.1%   per year for Cheniere Holdings  and   Blackstone CQP Holdco   s   Class B units  , respectively.  The impact of the beneficial conversion feature is also included in earnings per unit for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  
    
  The following is a schedule by years, based on the capital structure as of   September 30, 2016  , of the anticipated impact to the capital accounts in connection with the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature (in thousands):

Overview of Business 
    
  We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed by Cheniere.  Our vision is to be recognized as the premier global LNG company and provide a reliable, competitive and integrated source of LNG to our customers while creating a safe, productive and rewarding work environment for our employees.  Through our wholly owned subsidiary, SPLNG, we own and operate the regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, on the Sabine-Neches Waterway less than four miles from the Gulf Coast.  The Sabine Pass LNG terminal includes existing infrastruct  ure of five LNG storage tanks with capacity of   approximately   16.9   Bcfe  , two   marine berths   that can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4.0   Bcf/d  .    We are developing and constructing   natural gas liquefaction facilities   (the  Liquefaction Project )   at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities   through our wholly owned subsidiary, SPL.  We plan to construct up to six Trains, which are in various stages of development and construction.  Trains 1 and 2 have commenced operating activities, Train 3 is undergoing commissioning, Trains 4 and 5 are under construction and Train 6 is fully permitted.  Each Train is expected to have a nominal production capacity of approximately 4.5   mtpa   of LNG.  We also own a 94-mile pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines   (the  Creole Trail Pipeline )   through our wholly owned subsidiary, CTPL.   

Overview of Significant Events  
    
  Our significant accomplishments since January 1,   2016   and through the filing date of this Form 10-Q include the following:   
             
    SPL commenced production and shipment of LNG commissioning cargoes from Trains 1 and 2 of the   Liquefaction Project   in February and August 2016, respectively, and achieved substantial completion and commenced operating activities in May and September 2016, respectively. 
                
    In September 2016, SPL initiated the commissioning process for Train 3 of the   Liquefaction Project  . 
                
    In October 2016, the previously announced planned outage to improve performance of the flare systems at the   Liquefaction Project  , as well as to perform scheduled maintenance to Train 1 and other facilities, was completed on schedule and budget. 
                
    In May 2016, the board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP appointed Jack Fusco as the Chief Executive Officer of Cheniere Partners GP.

In August and September 2016, the board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP accepted the resignations of Meg A. Gentle and R. Keith Teague and Cheniere Partners GP Holding Company, LLC appointed Eric Bensuade and Doug Shanda to the board of directors of Cheniere Partners GP. 
                
    In February 2016, we entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement for the incurrence of debt of up to an aggregate amount of approximately $2.8 billion   (the  2016 CQP Credit Facilities )  .  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   consist of: (1) a   $450.0 million   CTPL tranche term loan that was used to prepay the   $400.0 million   term loan facility   (the  CTPL Term Loan )   in February 2016, (2) an approximately   $2.1 billion   SPLNG tranche term loan that will be used to redeem or repay the approximately   $2.1 billion   of the 7.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 issued by SPLNG   (the  2016 SPLNG Senior Notes )   and the 6.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 issued by SPLNG   (the  2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  and collectively with the 2016 SPLNG Senior Notes, the  SPLNG Senior Notes )   (which must be redeemed or repaid concurrently under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   ), (3) a   $125.0 million   debt service reserve credit facility   (the  DSR Facility )   that may be used to satisfy a   six  -month debt service reserve requirement and (4) a   $115.0 million   revolving credit facility that may be used for general business purposes.  
                
    In June and September 2016, SPL issued 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2026   (the  2026 SPL Senior Notes )   and 5.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2027   (the  2027 SPL Senior Notes )  , respectively, for aggregate principal amounts of   $1.5 billion   each.  Net proceeds of the offerings of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and   2027 SPL Senior Notes   were approximately   $1.3 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , respectively, after deducting commissions, fees and expenses and incremental interest required under the respective senior notes during construction.  The net proceeds were used to prepay a portion (for the   2026 SPL Senior Notes  ) or all (for the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  ) of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities we entered into in June 2015   (the  2015 SPL Credit Facilities )  .  The remaining proceeds from the   2027 SPL Senior Notes   are being used to pay a portion of the capital costs in connection with the construction of Trains 1 through 5 of the   Liquefaction Project   in lieu of the terminated portion of the commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  . 
                
    In October 2016, SPLNG issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of its outstanding   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  .  The redemption date will be November 30, 2016 (the  Redemption Date ) and the price will be equal to 103.250% of the principal amount of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date.  Concurrently with the redemption of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , SPLNG intends to repay all of its outstanding   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , which mature on the Redemption Date, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $12.5 million   of cash and cash equivalents and   $582.2 million   of current and non-current restricted cash (which included current and non-current restricted cash available to us and our subsidiaries) designated for the following purposes:   $127.5 million   for the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  ,   $325.6 million   for the   Liquefaction Project   and   $129.1 million   for interest payments related to the   SPLNG Senior Notes  . 
    
  Sabine Pass LNG Terminal    
    
  Regasification Facilities 
    
  The Sabine Pass LNG terminal has operational regasification capacity of approximately 4.0   Bcf/d   and aggregate LNG storage capacity of approximately 16.9   Bcfe  .  Approximately 2.0   Bcf/d   of the regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal has been reserved under two long-term third-party   TUA  s, under which SPLNG s customers are required to pay fixed monthly fees, whether or not they use the LNG terminal.  Each of Total Gas   Power North America, Inc.   ( Total )   and Chevron U.S.A. Inc.   ( Chevron )   has reserved approximately 1.0   Bcf/d   of regasification capacity and is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $125 million annually for 20 years that commenced in 2009.  Total S.A. has guaranteed   Total   s obligations under its   TUA   up to $2.5 billion, subject to certain exceptions, and Chevron Corporation has guaranteed   Chevron   s obligations under its   TUA   up to 80% of the fees payable by   Chevron  .  
    
  The remaining approximately 2.0   Bcf/d   of capacity has been reserved under a   TUA   by SPL.  SPL is obligated to make monthly capacity payments to SPLNG aggregating approximately $250 million annually, continuing until at least 20 years after  
  
   29 

SPL delivers its first commercial cargo at the   Liquefaction Project  .  SPL entered into a partial TUA assignment agreement with   Total  , whereby SPL will progressively gain access to   Total   s capacity and other services provided under   Total   s TUA with SPLNG.  This agreement will provide SPL with additional berthing and storage capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal that may be used to accommodate the development of Trains 5 and 6, provide increased flexibility in managing LNG cargo loading and unloading activity starting with the commencement of commercial operations of Train 3 and permit SPL to more flexibly manage its LNG storage capacity with the commencement of Train 1.  Notwithstanding any arrangements between   Total   and SPL, payments required to be made by   Total   to SPLNG will continue to be made by   Total   to SPLNG in accordance with its TUA. 
    
  Under each of these   TUA  s, SPLNG is entitled to retain 2% of the LNG delivered to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. 
    
  Liquefaction Facilities 
    
  The   Liquefaction Project   is being developed and constructed at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities.  We have received authorization from the   FERC   to site, construct and operate Trains 1 through 6.  We commenced construction of Trains 1 and 2 and the related new facilities needed to treat, liquefy, store and export natural gas in August 2012.  In May 2016 and September 2016, Trains 1 and 2 achieved substantial completion, respectively.  Construction of Trains 3 and 4 and the related facilities commenced in May 2013.  In June 2015, we commenced construction of Train 5 and the related facilities.  In October 2016, the previously announced planned outage to improve performance of the flare systems at the   Liquefaction Project  , as well as to perform scheduled maintenance to Train 1 and other facilities, was completed on schedule and budget. 
    
  The   DOE   has authorized the export of domestically produced LNG by vessel from Trains 1 through 4 of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to   FTA countries   for a 30-year term, which commenced on May 15, 2016, and to   non-FTA countries   for a 20-year term, which commenced on June 3, 2016, in an amount up to a combined total of the equivalent of 16   mtpa   (approximately 803   Bcf/yr   of natural gas).  The   DOE   further issued orders authorizing SPL to export domestically produced LNG by vessel from Trains 1 through 4 of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to   FTA countries   for a 25-year term and non-FTA countries for a 20-year term, in an amount up to a combined total of the equivalent of approximately 203   Bcf/yr   of natural gas.  Additionally, the   DOE   issued orders authorizing us to export domestically produced LNG by vessel from Trains 5 and 6 of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to   FTA countries   and   non-FTA countries   for a 20-year term, in an amount up to a combined total of 503.3   Bcf/yr   of natural gas (approximately 10 mtpa).  A party to the proceedings requested rehearings of the orders above related to the export of 803   Bcf/yr  , 203   Bcf/yr   and 503.3   Bcf/yr   to non-FTA countries.  The   DOE   issued orders denying rehearing of the orders related to 803   Bcf/yr   and 503.3   Bcf/yr   but has not yet issued a final ruling on the rehearing request related to the 203   Bcf/yr  .  In July 2016, the same party petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the DOE order related to the export of 503.3 Bcf/yr to non-FTA countries and the order denying the request for rehearing of the same.  The appeal is pending.  In each case, the terms of these authorizations begin on the earlier of the date of first export thereunder or the date specified in the particular order, which ranges from five to 10 years from the date the order was issued.  In addition, we have a 3-year makeup period with respect to each of the non-FTA orders for LNG volumes we were unable to export during the initial 20-year export period of such order.  Furthermore, in January 2016, the   DOE   issued an order authorizing us to export domestically produced LNG by vessel from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal to   FTA countries   and   non-FTA countries   over a two-year period commencing on January 15, 2016, in an aggregate amount up to the equivalent of 600   Bcf   of natural gas (however, exports to   non-FTA countries   under this order, when combined with exports to   non-FTA countries   under the orders related to Trains 1 through 4 above, may not exceed 1,006   Bcf/yr  ). 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Trains 1 and 2 of the   Liquefaction Project   had achieved substantial completion.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the overall project completion percentage for Trains 3 and 4 of the   Liquefaction Project   was approximately   91.8%  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the overall project completion percentage for Train 5 of the   Liquefaction Project   was approximately   42.8%   with engineering, procurement, subcontract work and construction approximately   90.8%  ,   62.0%  ,   41.9%   and   4.6%   complete, respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the overall project completion of each of our Trains was ahead of the contractual schedule.  We produced our first LNG from Train 1 of the   Liquefaction Project   in February 2016 and achieved substantial completion in May 2016.  We produced our first LNG from Train 2 of the   Liquefaction Project   in August 2016 and achieved substantial completion in September 2016.  Based on our current construction schedule, Trains 3 and 4 are expected to achieve substantial completion in 2017 and Train 5 is expected to achieve substantial completion in 2019.

Customers 
    
  SPL has entered into six fixed price, 20-year   SPA  s with third parties to make available an aggregate amount of LNG that equates to approximately 19.75   mtpa   of LNG, which is approximately 88% of the expected aggregate nominal production capacity of Trains 1 through 5.  The obligation to make LNG available under the SPAs commences from the date of first commercial delivery for Trains 1 through 5, as specified in each SPA.  Under these   SPA  s, the customers will purchase LNG from SPL for a price consisting of a fixed fee (a portion of which is subject to annual adjustment for inflation) per MMBtu of LNG plus a variable fee equal to 115% of   Henry Hub   per   MMBtu   of LNG.  In certain circumstances, the customers may elect to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, in which case the customers would still be required to pay the fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes that are not delivered as a result of such cancellation or suspension.  The   SPA  s and contracted volumes to be made available under the   SPA  s are not tied to a specific Train; however, the term of each   SPA   commences upon the start of operations of a specified Train.   
    
  In aggregate, the fixed fee portion to be paid by the third-party SPA customers is approximately $2.9 billion annually for Trains 1 through 5, with the applicable fixed fees starting from the date of first commercial delivery from the applicable Train.  These fixed fees equal approximately $411 million, $564 million, $650 million, $648 million and $588 million for each of Trains 1 through 5, respectively. 
    
  In addition, Cheniere Marketing has entered into an   SPA   with SPL to purchase, at Cheniere Marketing s option, any LNG produced by SPL in excess of that required for other customers. 
    
  Natural Gas Transportation, Storage and Supply 
    
  To ensure SPL is able to transport adequate natural gas feedstock to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal, it has entered into transportation precedent and other agreements to secure firm pipeline transportation capacity with CTPL and third-party pipeline companies.  SPL has entered into firm storage services agreements with third parties to assist in managing volatility in natural gas needs for the   Liquefaction Project  .  SPL has also entered into enabling agreements and long-term natural gas supply contracts with third parties in order to secure natural gas feedstock for the Liquefaction Project.  As of   September 30, 2016  , SPL has secured up to approximately   1,982.0 million   MMBtu of natural gas feedstock through long-term natural gas supply contracts. 
    
  Construction 
    
  SPL entered into lump sum turnkey contracts with Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc.   ( Bechtel )   for the engineering, procurement and construction of Trains 1 through 5, under which   Bechtel   charges a lump sum for all work performed and generally bears project cost risk unless certain specified events occur, in which case   Bechtel   may cause SPL to enter into a change order, or SPL agrees with   Bechtel   to a change order.   
    
  The total contract prices of the EPC contract for Trains 1 and 2, the EPC contract for Trains 3 and 4 and the EPC Contract for Train 5 of the   Liquefaction Project   are approximately   $4.1 billion  ,   $3.9 billion   and   $3.0 billion  , respectively, reflecting amounts incurred under change orders through   September 30, 2016  .  Total expected capital costs for Trains 1 through 5 are estimated to be between   $12.5 billion   and   $13.5 billion   before financing costs and between   $17.0 billion   and   $18.0 billion   after financing costs, including, in each case, estimated owner s costs and contingencies.  
    
  Final Investment Decision on Train 6 
    
  We will contemplate making a final investment decision to commence construction of Train 6 of the   Liquefaction Project   based upon, among other things, entering into an   EPC   contract, entering into acceptable commercial arrangements and obtaining adequate financing to construct the Train. 
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  We currently expect that SPL s capital resources requirements with respect to Trains 1 through 5 of the   Liquefaction Project   will be financed through one or more of the following: borrowings, equity contributions from us and cash flows under the   SPA  s.  We believe that with the net proceeds of borrowings, available commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  , available commitments under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   (as defined below) and cash flows from operations, we will have adequate financial resources available to complete Trains 1 through 5 of the   Liquefaction Project   and to meet our currently anticipated  
  
   31 

capital, operating and debt service requirements.  SPL began generating cash flows from operations from the   Liquefaction Project   in May 2016, when Train 1 achieved substantial completion and initiated operating activities.  Additionally, during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we realized offsets to LNG terminal costs of   $58.7 million   and   $201.0 million  , respectively, that were related to the sale of commissioning cargoes because these amounts were earned prior to the start of commercial operations, during the testing phase for the construction of Trains 1 and 2 of the   Liquefaction Project  . 
       
  Senior Secured Notes 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our subsidiaries had nine series of senior secured notes outstanding: 
           Interest on the   SPL Senior Notes   is payable semi-annually in arrears.  Subject to permitted liens, the   SPLNG Senior Notes   are secured on a   pari passu   first-priority basis by a security interest in all of SPLNG s equity interests and substantially all of SPLNG s operating assets.  The   SPL Senior Notes   are secured on a first-priority basis by a security interest in all of the membership interests in SPL and substantially all of SPL s assets. 
    
  SPLNG may redeem all or part of its   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of:  
              
    the excess of: (1) the present value at such redemption date of (a) the redemption price of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   plus (b) all required interest payments due on the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over (2) the principal amount of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , if greater. 
       
  SPLNG may redeem all or part of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   at any time on or after November 1, 2016 at fixed redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.  
    
  At any time prior to three months before the respective dates of maturity for each series of the   SPL Senior Notes  , SPL may redeem all or part of such series of the   SPL Senior Notes   at a redemption price equal to the  make-whole  price set forth in the common indenture governing the   SPL Senior Notes     (the  SPL Indenture )  , plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.  SPL may also, at any time within three months of the respective maturity dates for each series of the   SPL Senior Notes  , redeem all or part of such series of the   SPL Senior Notes   at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of the   SPL Senior Notes   to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. 

32 

On October 14, 2016, SPLNG issued a notice of redemption to redeem all of its outstanding   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  .  The redemption date will be November 30, 2016 (the  Redemption Date ) and the price will be equal to 103.250% of the principal amount of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date.  Concurrently with the redemption of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes  , SPLNG intends to repay all of its outstanding   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , which mature on the Redemption Date, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes  , plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   to, but not including, the Redemption Date.  The redemption of the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   and the repayment of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   will be funded with borrowings under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   we entered into in February 2016, as further described below. 
    
  Under the indentures governing the   SPLNG Senior Notes     (the  SPLNG Indentures )  , except for permitted tax distributions, SPLNG may not make distributions until, among other requirements, deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts and a fixed charge coverage ratio test of 2:1 is satisfied.  Under the   SPL Indenture  , SPL may not make any distributions until, among other requirements, deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts as required and a debt service coverage ratio test of 1.25:1.00 is satisfied.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , SPLNG made distributions of   $230.4 million   and   $267.9 million  , respectively, after satisfying all the applicable conditions in the   SPLNG Indentures  . 
    
  The   SPL Indenture   includes restrictive covenants.  SPL may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including by issuing additional notes, and such indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and have different maturity dates and more restrictive covenants than the current outstanding indebtedness of SPL, including the   SPL Senior Notes  , the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   and the   SPL Working Capital Facility  .  
       
  2015 SPL Credit Facilities    
  In June 2015, SPL entered into the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   with commitments aggregating $4.6 billion.  The   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   are being used to fund a portion of the costs of developing, constructing and placing into operation Trains 1 through 5 of the   Liquefaction Project  .  Borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   may be refinanced, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty; however, interest rate hedging and interest rate breakage costs may be incurred.  During 2016, in conjunction with the issuance of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  , SPL prepaid outstanding borrowings and terminated commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   for approximately   $2.6 billion  .  These prepayments and termination of commitments resulted in a write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   of   $25.8 million   and   $51.8 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.   As of   September 30, 2016  , SPL had   $2.0 billion   of available commitments and   no   outstanding borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  .  
    
  Loans under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   accrue interest at a variable rate per annum equal to, at SPL s election,   LIBOR   or the base rate plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 1.30% to 1.75%, depending on the applicable   2015 SPL Credit Facility  , and the applicable margin for base rate loans is 1.75%.  Interest on LIBOR loans is due and payable at the end of each LIBOR period and interest on base rate loans is due and payable at the end of each quarter.  In addition, SPL is required to pay insurance/guarantee premiums of 0.45% per annum on any drawn amounts under the covered tranches of the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  .  The   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   also require SPL to pay a quarterly commitment fee calculated at a rate per annum equal to either: (1) 40% of the applicable margin, multiplied by the average daily amount of the undrawn commitment, or (2) 0.70% of the undrawn commitment, depending on the applicable   2015 SPL Credit Facility  .  The principal of the loans made under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   must be repaid in quarterly installments, commencing with the earlier of June 30, 2020 and the last day of the first full calendar quarter after the completion date of Trains 1 through 5 of the   Liquefaction Project  .  Scheduled repayments are based upon an 18-year amortization profile, with the remaining balance due upon the maturity of the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  . 
    
  The   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   contain conditions precedent for borrowings, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants.  The obligations of SPL under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   are secured by substantially all of the assets of SPL as well as all of the membership interests in SPL on a   pari passu   basis with the   SPL Senior Notes   and   SPL Working Capital Facility  . 
    
  Under the terms of the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  , SPL is required to hedge not less than 65% of the variable interest rate exposure of its projected outstanding borrowings, calculated on a weighted average basis in comparison to its anticipated draw of principal.  Additionally, SPL may not make any distributions until certain conditions have been met, including that deposits are made into debt service reserve accounts and a debt service coverage ratio test of 1.25:1.00 is satisfied.

2013 SPL Credit Facilities 
   In May 2013, SPL entered into four credit facilities aggregating $5.9 billion   (collectively, the  2013 SPL Credit Facilities )   to fund a portion of the costs of developing, constructing and placing into operation Trains 1 through 4 of the   Liquefaction Project  .  In June 2015, the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   were replaced with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  . 
    
  In March 2015, in conjunction with SPL s issuance of the   2025 SPL Senior Notes  , SPL terminated approximately $1.8 billion of commitments under the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities  .  This termination and the replacement of the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   in June 2015 resulted in a write-off of debt issuance costs and deferred commitment fees associated with the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   of $96.3 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  CTPL Term Loan    
  In May 2013, CTPL entered into the   CTPL Term Loan  , which was used to fund modifications to the   Creole Trail Pipeline   and for general business purposes.  In February 2016, CTPL prepaid the full amount of $400.0 million outstanding under the   CTPL Term Loan   with capital contributions from us, which we funded with borrowings under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .  This prepayment resulted in a write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of   $1.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  2016 CQP Credit Facilities 
    
  In February 2016, we entered into the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  .  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   consist of: (1) a   $450.0 million   CTPL tranche term loan that was used to prepay the   $400.0 million     CTPL Term Loan   in February 2016, (2) an approximately   $2.1 billion   SPLNG tranche term loan that will be used to redeem or repay the approximately   $2.1 billion   of the   2016 SPLNG Senior Notes   and the   2020 SPLNG Senior Notes   (which must be redeemed or repaid concurrently under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   ), (3) the   $125.0 million     DSR Facility   that may be used to satisfy a   six  -month debt service reserve requirement and (4) a   $115.0 million   revolving credit facility that may be used for general business purposes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.3 billion   of available commitments,   $7.5 million   aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and   $450.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 CQP Credit Facilities. 
    
  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   accrue interest at a variable rate per annum equal to LIBOR or the base rate (equal to the highest of the prime rate, the federal funds effective rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus   0.50%   and adjusted one month LIBOR plus   1.0%  ), plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin for LIBOR loans is   2.25%   per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans is   1.25%   per annum, in each case with a   0.50%   step-up beginning on February 25, 2019.  Interest on LIBOR loans is due and payable at the end of each applicable LIBOR period (and at the end of every three month period within the LIBOR period, if any), and interest on base rate loans is due and payable at the end of each calendar quarter.  
    
  We incurred   $48.7 million   of debt issuance costs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and will incur an additional   $21.5 million   of debt issuance costs when the SPLNG tranche is funded.  We pay a commitment fee equal to an annual rate of   40%   of the margin for LIBOR loans multiplied by the average daily amount of the undrawn commitment, payable quarterly in arrears.  The   DSR Facility   and the revolving credit facility are both available for the issuance of letters of credit, which incur a fee equal to an annual rate of   2.25%   of the undrawn portion with a   0.50%   step-up beginning on February 25, 2019.   
    
  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   mature on February 25, 2020, and the outstanding balance may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, except for interest hedging and interest rate breakage costs.  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   contain conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants and limit  our ability to make restricted payments, including distributions, to once per fiscal quarter as long as certain conditions are satisfied.  Under the terms of the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities  , we are required to hedge not less than   50%   of the variable interest rate exposure on its projected aggregate outstanding balance, maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of at least   1.15  x at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning March 31, 2019 and have a projected debt service coverage ratio of   1.55  x in order to incur additional indebtedness to refinance a portion of the existing obligations. 
    
  The   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   are unconditionally guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries other than: (1) SPL, (2) SPLNG until funding of its tranche term loan and (3) certain of our subsidiaries owning other development projects, as well as certain other specified subsidiaries and members of the foregoing entities.

SPL Working Capital Facility    
    
  In September 2015, SPL entered into a $1.2 billion Amended and Restated Senior Working Capital Revolving Credit and Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement   (the  SPL Working Capital Facility )  , which replaced the $325.0 million Senior Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement that was entered into in April 2014.  The   SPL Working Capital Facility   is intended to be used for loans to SPL   ( Working Capital Loans )  , the issuance of letters of credit, as well as for swing line loans to SPL   ( Swing Line Loans )  , primarily for certain working capital requirements related to developing and placing into operation the   Liquefaction Project  .  SPL may, from time to time, request increases in the commitments under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   of up to $760 million and, upon the completion of the debt financing of Train 6 of the   Liquefaction Project  , request an incremental increase in commitments of up to an additional $390 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , SPL had   $764.5 million   of available commitments,   $337.0 million   aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and   $98.5 million   loans outstanding under the   SPL Working Capital Facility  .  As of December 31, 2015, SPL had $1.1 billion of available commitments, $135.2 million aggregate amount of issued letters of credit and $15.0 million of loans outstanding under the SPL Working Capital Facility. 
    
  The   SPL Working Capital Facility   accrues interest at a variable rate per annum equal to LIBOR or the base rate (equal to the highest of the senior facility agent s published prime rate, the federal funds effective rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50% and one month LIBOR plus 0.50%), plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin for LIBOR loans under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   is 1.75% per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   is 0.75% per annum.  Interest on   Swing Line Loans   and loans deemed made in connection with a draw upon a letter of credit   ( LC Loans )   is due and payable on the date the loan becomes due.  Interest on LIBOR   Working Capital Loans   is due and payable at the end of each applicable LIBOR period, and interest on base rate   Working Capital Loans   is due and payable at the end of each fiscal quarter.  However, if such base rate Working Capital Loan is converted into a LIBOR Working Capital Loan, interest is due and payable on that date.  Additionally, if the loans become due prior to such periods, the interest also becomes due on that date. 
    
  SPL pays (1) a commitment fee equal to an annual rate of 0.70% on the average daily amount of the excess of the total commitment amount over the principal amount outstanding without giving effect to any outstanding   Swing Line Loans   and (2) a letter of credit fee equal to an annual rate of 1.75% of the undrawn portion of all letters of credit issued under the   SPL Working Capital Facility  .  If draws are made upon a letter of credit issued under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   and SPL does not elect for such draw   (an  LC Draw )   to be deemed an LC Loan, SPL is required to pay the full amount of the   LC Draw   on or prior to the business day following the notice of the   LC Draw  .  An   LC Draw   accrues interest at an annual rate of 2.0% plus the base rate.  As of   September 30, 2016  , no   LC Draw  s had been made upon any letters of credit issued under the   SPL Working Capital Facility  . 
    
  The   SPL Working Capital Facility   matures on December 31, 2020, and the outstanding balance may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty upon three business days  notice.    LC Loans   have a term of up to one year.    Swing Line Loans   terminate upon the earliest of (1) the maturity date or earlier termination of the   SPL Working Capital Facility  , (2) the date 15 days after such Swing Line Loan is made and (3) the first borrowing date for a Working Capital Loan or Swing Line Loan occurring at least three business days following the date the Swing Line Loan is made.  SPL is required to reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Working Capital Loans to zero for a period of five consecutive business days at least once each year.  
    
  The   SPL Working Capital Facility   contains conditions precedent for extensions of credit, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants.  The obligations of SPL under the   SPL Working Capital Facility   are secured by substantially all of the assets of SPL as well as all of the membership interests in SPL on a   pari passu   basis with the   SPL Senior Notes   and the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  .

Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  The following table (in thousands) summarizes the sources and uses of our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .  The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures, including accruals, which are referred to elsewhere in this report.  Additional discussion of these items follows the table. 

Operating Cash Flows 
    
  Operating cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $41.7 million   and   $168.0 million  , respectively.  The decrease in operating cash outflows in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily related to increased cash receipts from the sale of LNG cargoes, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses as a result of the commencement of operations of Trains 1 and 2 of the   Liquefaction Project   in May and September 2016, respectively. 
    
  Investing Cash Flows 
    
  Investing cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $1.9 billion   and   $2.2 billion  , respectively, and were primarily used to fund the construction costs for Trains 1 through 5 of the   Liquefaction Project  .  These costs are capitalized as construction-in-process until achievement of substantial completion.  Additionally, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , we used   $38.3 million   and   $50.7 million  , respectively, primarily to pay a municipal water district for water system enhancements that will increase potable water supply to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and payments made pursuant to the information technology services agreement for capital assets purchased on our behalf.  
    
  Financing Cash Flows 
    
  Financing cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $2.1 billion  , primarily as a result of: 
               
    issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   in June 2016, which was used to prepay $1.3 billion of the outstanding borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities  ; 
                
    issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion of the   2027 SPL Senior Notes   in September 2016, which was used to prepay $1.2 billion of the outstanding borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   and pay a portion of the capital costs in connection with the construction of Trains 1 through 5 of the   Liquefaction Project  ; 
     
   36 

$313.5 million of borrowings and a $230.0 million repayment made under the   SPL Working Capital Facility  ; 
                
    $89.4 million   of debt issuance costs related to up-front fees paid upon the closing of these transactions; and 
                
    $74.3 million   of distributions to unitholders. 
       
  Financing cash flows during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   were   $2.0 billion  , primarily as a result of: 
               
    $177.0 million   of debt issuance and deferred financing costs related to up-front fees paid upon the closing of these transactions; and 
                
    $74.3 million   of distributions to unitholders. 
        
  Cash Distributions to Unitholders  
    
  Our partnership agreement requires that, within 45 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement).  Our available cash is our cash on hand at the end of a quarter less the amount of any reserves established by our general partner.  All distributions paid to date have been made from accumulated operating surplus.  The following provides a summary of distributions paid by us during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

On   October 21, 2016  , we declared a   $0.425   distribution per common unit and the related distribution to our general partner will be paid on   November 11, 2016   to owners of record as of   November 1, 2016   for the period from   July 1, 2016   to   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The subordinated units will receive distributions only to the extent we have available cash above the initial quarterly distributions requirement for our common unitholders and general partner along with certain reserves.  Such available cash could be generated through new business development or fees received from Cheniere Marketing under an amended and restated variable capacity rights agreement pursuant to which Cheniere Marketing is obligated to pay Cheniere Investments 80% of the expected gross margin of each cargo of LNG that Cheniere Marketing arranges for delivery to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.  The ending of the subordination period and conversion of the subordinated units into common units will depend upon future business development.  
    
  In 2012 and 2013, we issued a new class of equity interests representing limited partner interests in us   ( Class B units )  , in connection with the development of the   Liquefaction Project  .  The   Class B units   are not entitled to cash distributions, except in the event of our liquidation or a merger, consolidation or other combination of us with another person or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.  The   Class B units   are subject to conversion, mandatorily or at the option of the holders of the   Class B units   under specified circumstances, into a number of common units based on the then-applicable conversion value of the   Class B units  .  On a quarterly basis beginning on the initial purchase date of the   Class B units  , the conversion value of the   Class B units   increases at a compounded rate of 3.5% per quarter, subject to an additional upward adjustment for certain equity and debt financings.  The accreted conversion ratio of the Class B units owned by Cheniere and   Blackstone CQP Holdco   was   1.80   and   1.77  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  .  We expect the Class B units to mandatorily convert into common units within   90 days   of the substantial completion date of Train 3 of the   Liquefaction Project  , which we currently expect to occur before June 30, 2017.  If the   Class B units   are not mandatorily converted by July 2019, the holders of the   Class B units   have the option to convert the   Class B units   into  
  
   37 

common units at that time.  The holders of   Class B units   have a preference over the holders of the subordinated units in the event of our liquidation or a merger, consolidation or other combination of us with another person or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.  

Results of Operations 
    
  Our consolidated net loss was   $81.5 million  , or   $0.27   per share (basic and diluted), in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss of   $24.1 million  , or   $0.18   per share (basic and diluted), in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  This   $57.4 million   increase in net loss in 2016 was primarily a result of increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, and increased loss on early extinguishment of debt, which were partially offset by decreased derivative loss, net and increased income from operations. 
    
  Our consolidated net loss was   $256.5 million  , or   $0.56   per share (basic and diluted), in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss of   $262.9 million  , or   $0.44   per share (basic and diluted), in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This   $6.3 million   decrease in net loss in 2016 was primarily a result of decreased loss on early extinguishment of debt, increased income from operations and decreased derivative loss, net, which were partially offset by increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.  
    
  Revenues 

We began recognizing LNG revenues from the   Liquefaction Project   following the substantial completion of Trains 1 and 2 in May and September 2016, respectively.  Prior to these dates, amounts received from the sale of commissioning cargoes from the respective Trains were offset against LNG terminal construction-in-process because these amounts were earned during the testing phase for the construction of those Trains of the   Liquefaction Project  .  During the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we loaded a total of   60.3 million   MMBtu and   113.8 million   MMBtu of LNG, respectively, of which   50.8 million   MMBtu and   69.0 million   MMBtu, respectively, resulted in the recognition of revenues related to this volume.  The remaining   9.5 million   MMBtu and   44.8 million   MMBtu of LNG loaded during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, were recognized as offsets to LNG terminal costs as they related to the sale of commissioning cargoes. 
    
  Operating costs and expenses 

Our total operating costs and expenses increased   $251.9 million   and   $317.6 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, primarily as a result of the commencement of operations of Trains 1 and 2 of the   Liquefaction Project   in May and September 2016, respectively, compared to a significant cost recovery recorded during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  This cost recovery was due  
  
   38 

to a $32.2 million increase in fair value for our natural gas supply contracts recorded for the period, which we recognized following the completion and placement into service of certain modifications to the underlying pipeline infrastructure and the resulting development of a market for physical gas delivery at locations specified in a portion of our natural gas supply contracts.  Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly for the production and delivery of LNG from the   Liquefaction Project   such as natural gas feedstock, variable transportation and storage costs, derivative gains and losses associated with economic hedges to secure natural gas feedstock for the   Liquefaction Project  , and other related costs to convert natural gas into LNG, all to the extent not utilized for the commissioning process.  Operating and maintenance expense includes costs associated with operating and maintaining the   Liquefaction Project   such as third-party service and maintenance contract costs, payroll and benefit costs of operations personnel, natural gas transportation and storage capacity demand charges, derivative gains and losses related to the sale and purchase of LNG associated with the regasification terminal, insurance and regulatory costs.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   as we began depreciation of our assets related to Trains 1 and 2 of the   Liquefaction Project   upon reaching substantial completion. 
    
  Offsetting the increases described above was a decrease in general and administrative expense affiliate, which was partially due to a decrease in the amount payable under our service agreements with affiliates and partially due to a reallocation of resources from general and administrative activities to operating and maintenance activities following commencement of operations at the   Liquefaction Project  . 
    
  Other expense (income) 

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased   $63.9 million   and   $86.3 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, due to an increase in our indebtedness outstanding (before premium, discount and unamortized debt issuance costs), from $11.2 billion as of   September 30, 2015   to   $14.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , and the decrease in the portion of total interest costs that could be capitalized as Trains 1 and 2 of the   Liquefaction Project   are no longer in construction.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $220.2 million   and   $618.6 million   of total interest cost, respectively, of which we capitalized   $106.9 million   and   $389.9 million  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we incurred   $185.2 million   and   $520.1 million   of total interest cost, respectively, of which we capitalized   $135.8 million   and   $377.7 million  , respectively. 
    
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased by   $25.8 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , whereas it decreased   $42.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  Loss on early extinguishment of debt during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was attributable to a   $25.8 million   write-off of debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of outstanding borrowings and termination of commitments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   of approximately   $1.4 billion   in September 2016 in connection with the issuance of the   2027 SPL Senior Notes  .  Loss on early extinguishment of debt during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   further included a $26.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding borrowings under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   in June 2016 in connection with the issuance of the   2026 SPL Senior Notes   and a   $1.5 million   write-off of debt issuance costs and unamortized discount in connection with the prepayment of the CTPL Term Loan in February 2016.  Loss on early extinguishment of debt during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was attributable to the $7.3 million write-off of debt issuance costs and deferred commitment fees related to the termination and replacement of the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   with the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities   in June 2015 and a $89.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs and deferred commitment fees related to the termination of approximately $1.8 billion of commitments under the   2013 SPL Credit Facilities   in March 2015. 
    
   Derivative loss (gain), net decreased   $20.1 million   from a loss of   $10.9 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015   to a gain of   $9.2 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a relative increase in the forward LIBOR curve in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  Derivative loss, net decreased by   $20.1 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the $34.7 million loss recognized in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   upon the termination of interest rate swaps associated with the   2013 Credit Facilities   in March 2015, which was offset by a loss recognized in the   nine  
  
   39 

months ended September 30, 2016   due to the increase in the notional amount of interest rate swaps related to the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities   entered into in February 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no transactions that met the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial position or operating results.  

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
     
  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with   GAAP   requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes.  There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
       
  Cash Investments     
    
  We have cash investments that we manage based on internal investment guidelines that emphasize liquidity and preservation of capital.  Such cash investments are stated at historical cost, which approximates fair market value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
    
  Marketing and Trading Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We have entered into commodity derivatives consisting of natural gas supply contracts to secure natural gas feedstock for the   Liquefaction Project     ( Liquefaction Supply Derivatives )  .  In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the   Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   to changes in underlying commodity prices, management modeled a 10% change in the basis price for natural gas for each delivery location.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair value of the   Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   to be   $12.1 million  .  Based on actual derivative contractual volumes, a 10% increase or decrease in the underlying basis prices would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the   Liquefaction Supply Derivatives   of   $0.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to $0.9 million as of   December 31, 2015  .  See    Note 7 Derivative Instruments    for additional details about our derivative instruments. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  SPL has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating-rate interest payments under the   2015 SPL Credit Facilities     ( SPL Interest Rate Derivatives )  .  In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the   SPL Interest Rate Derivatives   to changes in interest rates, management modeled a 10% change in the forward 1-month LIBOR curve across the remaining term of the   SPL Interest Rate Derivatives  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair value of the   SPL Interest Rate Derivatives   to be a liability of   $15.9 million  .  This 10% change in interest rates would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the   SPL Interest Rate Derivatives   of   $1.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to $3.1 million as of   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in the effect of change in interest rates was due to a decrease in the forward 1-month   LIBOR   curve during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to volatility in a portion of the floating-rate interest payments under the   2016 CQP Credit Facilities     ( CQP Interest Rate Derivatives )  .  In order to test the sensitivity of the fair value of the   CQP Interest Rate Derivatives   to changes in interest rates, management modeled a 10% change in the forward 1-month   LIBOR   curve across the remaining term of the   CQP Interest Rate Derivatives  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we estimated the fair value of the   CQP Interest Rate Derivatives   to be a liability of   $12.2 million  .  This 10% change in interest rates would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the   CQP Interest Rate Derivatives   of   $3.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .
