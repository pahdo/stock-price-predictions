  (unaudited)  

Note 1 - Organization and Operations
and Basis of Presentation  

Safco Investment Corp (formerly  ACE
Consulting Management, Inc.  or the  Company ) was incorporated on September 19, 2003 under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company engages in consulting to corporations to improve growth strategies, performance enhancement and maximization
of share value. 

Our objective is to become a leader
of small to medium sized business-consulting services. Our business strategy for accomplishing this objective includes attracting
and retaining outstanding professionals on an as-needed basis, develop long-term client relationships, enhancing and extending
our service offerings and building our corporate image. Our mission is to bridge U.S. and Chinese businesses in various fields
to grow our consulting business. Our motto is to deliver reliable service and to provide value to our clients. 

We look to assist Chinese companies
in utilizing U.S. knowhow and technology in order to enhance their local competitiveness in China. Likewise, we seek to enhance
the global competitiveness of Chinese and American firms seeking to establish a presence overseas. 

Meanwhile, we have not generated meaningful
revenues and our limited assets consist solely of cash. 

The unaudited condensed financial statements
of the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, applied on a consistent
basis, and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and the requirements of Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) . Accordingly, they do not include all the information
and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete audited financial statements. However, the information included in these financial
statements reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management,
necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position and the results of operations. Results shown for
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year or any future annual or interim
period. The balance sheet information as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited financial statements as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ) on April 14, 2016. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report. 

Going Concern   

These financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in
the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of $58,634 at September 30, 2016, and incurred a net loss of $24,426 and used cash in operating activities of $25,061
for the reporting period then ended. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern. In addition, the Company's independent certified public accounting firm in its report on the December 31, 2015
financial statements has raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is attempting to generate
sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the
Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be
no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further
implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds. 

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  

The
Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of
accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to
the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult, subjective,
or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
The Company s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted
accounting principles.  

Management Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates reflected in the
financial statements include, but are not limited to, valuation of deferred tax asset and share-based compensation costs. Changes
in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:  

Level
    1  
         
      Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level
    2  
         
       Pricing
                                                                                                          inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as
                                                                                                          of the reporting date.    

Level
    3  
         
      Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the
related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped
or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
reasonably assured. The Company derived no revenue during nine months periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Stock-Based
Compensation     

The
Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in capital raising transactions, for services
and for financing costs. The Company accounts for share-based payments under the guidance as set forth in the Share-Based Payment
Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for
all share-based payment awards made to employees, officers, directors, and consultants, including employee stock options, based
on estimated fair values. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards to employees and directors on the
date of grant using an option-pricing model, and the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is
recognized as expense over the required service period in the Company's Statements of Operations. The Company accounts for stock
option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance where the value of
the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment
is reached, or b) the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Stock-based compensation
is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time
of grant and revised, as necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

The
fair value of the Company s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing
model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options
or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton
Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could
materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes that allows recognition and
measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and
liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance
is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to
realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain. The Company s policy is to recognize interest and/or
penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.  

Net
Income (Loss) per Common Share    

Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net
income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued, using the treasury
stock method. Potential common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.  

There
were no potentially outstanding dilutive common shares for the reporting period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in
the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from
costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s financial statements
and disclosures.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties
in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability
to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.  An entity must provide certain
disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU
2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,  Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to
record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12
months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at,
or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical
expedients available. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements
and disclosures.  

Note 3   Related Party Transactions  

Advances from stockholder   

From time to time, a stockholder of
the Company advance funds to the Company for working capital purpose. Those advances are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due
on demand. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the balance of amounts advanced by a stockholder to the Company, used for working capital purposes, amounted to $54,880
and $39,218, respectively. 

Free Office Space   

The Company has been provided office
space by an officer of the Company at no cost. The management determined that such cost is nominal and did not recognize the rent
expense in its financial statements. 

Note 4    Subsequent
Event  

On July 30, 2014, the Company, the former
majority shareholders of the Company (the  Sellers ) and Pan Asia Holdings Corp. (the
 Purchasers ) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ), whereby the
Purchasers purchased from the Sellers 29,316,924 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company,
representing approximately 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of
$500,000 (the  Purchase Price ). Through September 30, 2016, $300,000 has been paid and the balance was to be
paid before December 31, 2016 or sooner at a mutually agreed date.   On October 14 th , 2016, Purchasers
and Sellers mutually agreed to terminate the Securities Purchase Agreement, and the Purchasers returned 20,521,846 shares to
the Sellers.    

The 20,521,846 shares returned by the Purchasers were reissued to Chi Jen Chen, a related party to the
Seller. This transaction constituted a change of control in the registrant. 

Item 2.     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and
other reports filed by Safco Investment Holding Corp. (the  Company ) from time to time with the SEC (collectively,
the  Filings ) contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and
information currently available to, the Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company s
management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and
speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate, 
 expect,   future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative of these terms and similar
expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements
reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and
other factors, including the risks relating to the Company s business, industry, and the Company s operations and results
of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned. 

Although the Company believes that the
expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of
activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States,
the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Our financial statements are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). These accounting principles
require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon
which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions
are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date
of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial
statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many
cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. 

Business
Overview   

We
are a business consulting firm that applies our services to a broad range of clients that will enable companies to effectively
increase profitability as well as advance the development of their businesses. We provide advice for clients involved in many
matters and general corporate strategies.  

We
derive revenues principally from professional services rendered by our employee. In most instances, we charge clients on a time-and-materials
basis and recognize revenues in the period when we provide our services. We charge consultants  time at hourly rates and
on a per project basis. However, in the future, as we retain the services of additional outside employee consultants with differing
skills, our hourly rates may vary from consultant to consultant depending on a consultant s position, experience and expertise,
and other factors. Outside experts will not bill clients directly for their services, all of the billing will be done through
our office. As a result, we will generate substantially all of our own professional services fees from the work of our own full-time
consultants. Factors that affect our professional services fees include the number and scope of client engagements, the number
of consultants employed by us, the consultants  billing rates, and the number of hours worked by the consultants.  

On
July 30, 2014, the Company, the former majority shareholders of the Company (the  Sellers ) and Pan Asia Holdings
Corp. (the  Purchasers ) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ), whereby
the Purchasers purchased from the Sellers 29,316,924 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, representing
approximately 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of $500,000 (the  Purchase
Price ).     Through September 30, 2016, $300,000 has been paid and the balance was to be paid before
December 31, 2016 or sooner at a mutually agreed date.   On October 14 th , 2016, Purchasers and Sellers mutually
agreed to terminate the Securities Purchase Agreement, and the Purchasers has returned 20,521,846 shares to the Sellers.      

The
20,521,846 shares returned by the Purchasers were reissued to Chi Jen Chen, a related party to the Seller.   This transaction
constituted a change of control in the registrant.  

In
connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, on July 30, 2014, Alex Jen submitted to the Company a resignation letter pursuant
to which he resigned as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company effectively immediately.
He remains as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, Gary A. Tickel resigned from the Board of Directors
of the Company. Mr. Jen s and Mr. Tickel s resignations were not a result of any disagreements relating to the Company s
operations, policies or practices.  

On
July 30, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignations of Mr. Jen and Mr. Tickel and appointed Henry Lee
to serve as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Board of Directors.  

On
September 30, 2014, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company s name to Safco Investment
Holding Corp., and to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock to 100,000,000 shares of common stock; $0.001
par value and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock S0.001 par value.

we seek to enhance the global competitiveness of Chinese and American firms seeking to establish a presence overseas.  

Plan
of Operation   

We
have commenced limited operations and will require additional capital to recruit personnel to operate business and to implement
our business plan.

On
November 10, 2010, we entered into a business consultant agreement with Shanghai Tongao Investment Consulting Co, Ltd. for general
business advisory services. The term of the agreement is for a period of two years, which can be cancelled by either party on
a 30-day written notice to the other party. The compensation for this agreement shall be paid at the rate of $80/hour for work
performed in accordance with this agreement. However, we shall be paid at least $12,000 per year regardless of the amount of time
spent in accordance with this agreement. The business consultant agreement with Shanghai Tongao Investment Consulting Co, Ltd.
has expired.  

On
August 30, 2011, we terminated the service agreements with Beijing Poly Design Ltd. and Shanghai Gaogo Design and Construction
Ltd. due to the change of business environment in China which has caused difficulties to us in conducting businesses contemplated
under these service agreements in reasonable profit margin. Subsequently, we made a strategic decision to no longer provide services
to clients in connection with the food processing industry.  

On
December 2, 2011 we entered into a business consultant agreement with Vivid Spa Corp. Vivid Spa Corp is a company specializing
in health care, specifically skin care and massage therapy, located in Los Angeles, California. We assist Vivid Spa with its selection
and export of U.S. made essential oils and aroma therapy products. We also provide consulting assistance regarding opening Spa
facilities in Shanghai   Beijing and regarding introducing U.S. made products - including essential oils and aroma formula
therapies - in China. During this engagement, we provide a site analysis and rent comparison study for select locations in Shanghai
and Beijing. We also provide Vivid Spa Corp. analysis for licensing the business and obtaining permits for local facilities and
outdoor signage in China. Consulting services has included container and airfreight shipping options, customs duties, and advice
on clearing customs and product inspections upon arrival in China as well as providing market data on pricing, on brand positioning,
and on customer acquisition.  

In
the next 12 months if we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements, our major shareholders have indicated that they are willing
to loan additional funds to the Company to cover any shortfalls, although there is no written agreement or guarantee.  

We
plan to raise funds through equity financing in the next 12 months. If we successfully raise the funds, it will be used for our
operations and to invest in potential joint venture or acquisition.  

Results
of Operation   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we generated no revenue as compared to no revenue for the same period ended September
30, 2015.  

Expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $4,883 resulting in a net loss of $4,883. Expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $512 in general and administrative expenses and $4,371 in professional fees. In comparison,
expenses for the same period ended September 30, 2015 totaled $8,390 resulting in a net loss of $8,390. Expenses for the period
ended September 30, 2015 consisted of $1,376 in general and administrative expenses and $7,014 in professional fees. The decrease
in the expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was a result of decrease in professional fees and decrease
in general and administrative expenses.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated no revenue as compared to no revenue for the same period ended September
30, 2015.  

Expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $23,604 resulting in a net loss of $24,426. Expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $816 in general and administrative expenses and $22,788 in professional fees. In comparison,
expenses for the same period ended September 30, 2015 totaled $28,769 resulting in a net loss of $28,769. Expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of $1,558 in general and administrative expenses and $27,211 in professional fees. The
decrease in the expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was a result of a decrease in professional expenses
and a decrease in general and administrative expenses.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net cash used in operating activities was $25,061. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the net cash used in investing activities was $0. The net cash provided by financing activities was $15,662 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had $818 cash on hand. The Company is also dependent upon the
receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan. If continued
funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.  

As
reflected in the accompanying condensed financial statements, we have minimal operations and had a stockholders  deficit
at September 30, 2016. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and implement our business plan. In addition,
the Company s independent certified public accounting firm in its report on the December 31, 2015 financial statements raised
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  

Management
believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements, our major shareholders have
indicated their willingness to provide additional funds to the Company to cover any shortfalls, however, no written agreement
or guarantee exists to this effect.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments     

The
Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Paragraph 820-10-35-37 ) to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:  

Level
    1  
      Quoted
    market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.   

Level
    2  
      Pricing
    inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
    as of the reporting date.   

Level
    3  
      Pricing
    inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.   

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.  

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the
related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.  

Revenue
Recognition     

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped
or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
reasonably assured.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in
the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from
costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s financial statements
and disclosures.  

In
June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-12,  Compensation   Stock Compensation . The pronouncement
was issued to clarify the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could
be achieved after the requisite service period. The pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 will not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial position
or results of operations.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties
in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability
to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.  An entity must provide certain
disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU
2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company s financial statements and disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,  Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to
record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12
months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at,
or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical
expedients available. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statements
and disclosures.   

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangement   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangement.   

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

We do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage
in any hedging activities. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

(a)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation,
with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO )
and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of September 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure for the reason described below.  

Because
of our limited operations, we have a limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack
a formal audit committee with a financial expert. As we grow and expand our operations we will engage additional employees and
experts as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will expand.  

(b)     Changes in Internal Controls      

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1.     Legal Proceedings.

are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government
agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our Company or any of our
subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our
subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse
effect.  

Item 1A.     Risk Factors.
