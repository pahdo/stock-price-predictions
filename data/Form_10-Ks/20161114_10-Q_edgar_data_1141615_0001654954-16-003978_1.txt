NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. Business 

Commonwealth
Income and Growth Fund IV ( CIGF4  or the
 Partnership  or the  Fund ) is a limited
partnership organized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on April
20, 2001. The Partnership offered $15,000,000 of limited
partnership interest to the public on October 19, 2001. The
Partnership raised the minimum capital required ($1,150,000) and
commenced operations on July 8, 2002. The Partnership was fully
subscribed and terminated its offering of units on September 15,
2003 with 749,950 units ($14,967,729) sold. 

The
Partnership was originally scheduled to end its operational phase
on December 31, 2013.  During the year ended December 31,
2013, the operational phase was officially extended to December 31,
2015 through a proxy vote initiated by the General Partner. 
The Partnership s operational phase ended on December 31,
2015.  The Fund is scheduled to expire on December 31,
2017.  The General Partner has not formally approved a plan
for liquidation at this time.  As such, the Partnership will
continue to report its financial statements on a going concern
basis until a formal plan of liquidation is approved by the General
Partner. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there
were no limited partnership units redeemed. 

The
Partnership used the proceeds of the offering to acquire, own and
lease various types of information technology, medical technology,
telecommunications technology, inventory management equipment and
other similar capital equipment, which is leased primarily to U.S.
corporations and institutions. Commonwealth Capital Corp
( CCC ), on behalf of the Partnership and other
affiliated partnerships, acquires equipment subject to associated
debt obligations and lease agreements and allocate a participation
in the cost, debt and lease revenue to the various partnerships
that it manages based on certain risk factors. 

During
the Partnership s operational phase, the investment strategy
was to acquire high technology equipment consisting of medical,
telecommunications and inventory management equipment. As the
Partnership s operational phase has ended, the General
Partner will begin to curtail activity as it prepares the Fund for
the liquidation phase. 

The
Partnership s General Partner is Commonwealth Income  
Growth Fund, Inc. (the  General Partner ), a
Pennsylvania corporation which is an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of CCC. CCC is a member of the Investment Program
Association (IPA), REISA, Financial Planning Association (FPA), and
the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA). 

In an
effort to increase cash flow, the General Partner elected to forgo
distributions and allocations of net income or loss owed to it, and
suspended limited partner distributions during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016. The General Partner and CCC also
waived certain fees owed to them by the Partnership in an effort to
further support the Partnership. 

The
General Partner and CCC have committed to fund, either through cash
contributions and/or forgiveness of indebtedness, any necessary
operational cash shortfalls of the Partnership through December 31,
2016. The General Partner will continue to reassess the funding of
limited partner distributions throughout 2016 and will continue to
waive certain fees. If available cash flow or net disposition
proceeds are insufficient to cover the Partnership expenses and
liabilities on a short and long term basis, the Partnership may
attempt to obtain additional funds by disposing of or refinancing
equipment, or by borrowing within its permissible
limits. 

Allocations
of income and distributions of cash are based on the Agreement. The
various allocations under the Agreement prevent any limited
partner s capital account from being reduced below zero and
ensure the capital accounts reflect the anticipated sharing ratios
of cash distributions, as defined in the Agreement. During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the General Partner
elected to forgo distributions and allocations of net income owed
to it, and suspended limited partner distributions. The General
Partner will continue to reassess the funding of limited partner
distributions throughout 2016 and will continue to waive certain
fees.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The financial information presented as of any date other than
December 31, 2015 has been prepared from the books and records
without audit. The following unaudited condensed financial
statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Financial information as
of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial
statements of the Partnership, but does not include all disclosures
required by generally accepted accounting principles to be included
in audited financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for
the periods indicated, have been included. For further information
regarding the Partnership s accounting policies, refer to the
financial statements and related notes included in the
Partnership s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. Operating results for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of financial
results that may be expected for the full year ended December 31,
2016. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In June
2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-10,
 Technical Corrections and
Improvements-  Transition guidance varies based on the
amendments in this Update. The amendments in this Update that
require transition guidance are effective for all entities for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will
be effective upon the issuance of this Update. The Partnership is
currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will have on its
financial statements. This was adopted January 1, 2016; however,
adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Partnership s
financial statements during the nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

In
January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2015-01,  Income
Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20):
Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the
Concept of Extraordinary Items.  Effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments
prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments
retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial
statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance
is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The
effective date is the same for both public business entities and
all other entities. The Partnership is currently evaluating the
effect that this ASU will have on its financial statements. This
was adopted January 1, 2016; however, adoption of this ASU had no
impact on the Partnership s financial statements since there
were no extraordinary and unusual items to report during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. 

Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Estimated fair value was determined by management using available
market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
However, judgment was necessary to interpret market data and
develop estimated fair value. Cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other
liabilities are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate
their fair values as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
due to the short term nature of these financial
instruments. 

The Partnership s debt consists of notes payable, which
are secured by specific equipment and are nonrecourse liabilities
of the Partnership. The estimated fair value of this debt at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximates the carrying
value of these instruments, due to the interest rates on the debt
approximating current market interest rates. The Partnership
classifies the fair value of its notes payable within Level 2 of
the valuation hierarchy based on the observable inputs used to
estimate fair value.

Cash 

At September 30, 2016, cash was held in one bank account maintained
at one financial institution with a balance of approximately
$19,000.  Bank accounts are federally insured up to $250,000
by the FDIC.  At September 30, 2016, the total cash bank
balance was as follows: 

The
Partnership s bank balances are fully insured by the FDIC.
The Partnership deposits its funds with a Moody's Aaa-Rated banking
institution which is one of only three Aaa-Rated banks listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Partnership has not experienced
any losses in such accounts, and believes it is not exposed to any
significant credit risk. The amount in such accounts will fluctuate
throughout 2016 due to many factors, including cash receipts,
interest rates, and distribution to limited partners. 

Forgiveness of Related Party Payables 

In accordance with ASC Topic 470-50   Debt Modifications and
Extinguishments  , the
Partnership accounts for forgiveness of related party payables as
Partners' capital transactions.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In
August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
2016-15  Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments - The amendments in this Update apply to all
entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit

public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all
other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is

is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will have on its
financial statements. 

In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update-  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606):  No. 2016-12,  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical
Expedients,  No. 2016-10,  Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing  and No. 2016-08,  Principal versus Agent Considerations

effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the
amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and
transition requirements for Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended
by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update 2015-14,
 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ,
defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. Public
business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain
employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09
to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim

effect that this ASU will have on its financial
statements. 

In
August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date -
The amendments in this Update defer the effective date of Update
2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities,
certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans
should apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 to annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application
is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that
reporting period. The Partnership is currently evaluating the
effect that this ASU will have on its financial
statements. 

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014
-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern , requires management to determine whether
substantial doubt exists regarding the entity s going concern
presumption.  If substantial doubt exists but is not
alleviated by management s plans, the footnotes must
specifically state that  there is substantial doubt about the
entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the financial statements are issued.   In
addition, if substantial doubt exists, regardless of whether such
doubt was alleviated, entities must disclose (a) principal
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the
entity s ability to continue as a going concern (before
consideration of management s plans, if any); (b)
management s evaluation of the significance of those
conditions or events in relation to the entity s ability to
meet its obligations; and (c) management s plans that are
intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise
substantial doubt, or that did alleviate substantial doubt, about
the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  If
substantial doubt has not been alleviated, these disclosures should
become more extensive in subsequent reporting periods as additional
information becomes available.  In the period that substantial
doubt no longer exists (before or after considering
management s plans), management should disclose how the
principal conditions and events that originally gave rise to
substantial doubt have been resolved.  The ASU applies
prospectively to all entities for annual periods ending after
December 15, 2016, and to annual and interim periods
thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted.  The
Partnership is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will
have on its financial statements. 

In May
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers  (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all
existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core
principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised
goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be
entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five
step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more
judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue
recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The
standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the
following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach
reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting
period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or
(ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of
initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption
(which includes additional footnote disclosures).  The
Partnership is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will
have on its financial statements.

3. Information Technology, Medical Technology, Telecommunications
Technology, Inventory Management Equipment
( Equipment ) 

The Partnership is the lessor of equipment under leases with
periods that generally will range from 12 to 48 months. In general,
associated costs such as repairs and maintenance, insurance and
property taxes are paid by the lessee. 

Remarketing fees will be paid to the leasing companies from which
the Partnership purchases leases. These are fees that are earned by
the leasing companies when the initial terms of the lease have been
met. The General Partner believes that this strategy adds value
since it entices the leasing company to remain actively involved
with the lessees for potential extensions, remarketing or sale of
equipment. This strategy is designed to minimize any conflicts the
leasing company may have with a new lessee and may assist in
maximizing overall portfolio performance. The remarketing fee is
tied into lease performance thresholds and is a factor in the
negotiation of the fee. Remarketing fees incurred in connection
with lease extensions are accounted for as operating costs.
Remarketing fees incurred in connection with the sale of equipment
are included in the gain or loss calculations. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no remarketing fees
incurred and/or paid with cash or netted against receivables due
from such parties. 

Gains from the termination of leases are recognized when the lease
is modified and terminated concurrently.  Gains from lease
termination included in lease revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1,000 and $4,000,
respectively.   

CCC, on behalf of the Partnership and on behalf of other affiliated
companies and partnerships ( partnerships ), acquires
equipment subject to associated debt obligations and lease
agreements and allocates a participation in the cost, debt and
lease revenue to the various companies based on certain risk
factors. 

The Partnership s share of the cost of the equipment in which
it participates with other partnerships at September 30, 2016 was
approximately $731,000 and is included in the Partnership s
equipment on its balance sheet. The Partnership s share of
the outstanding debt associated with this equipment at September
30, 2016 was approximately $101,000 and is included in the
Partnership s notes payable on its balance sheet. The total
cost of the equipment shared by the Partnership with other
partnerships at September 30, 2016 was approximately $2,753,000.
 The total outstanding debt related to the equipment shared by
the Partnership at September 30, 2016 was approximately
$331,000. 

The Partnership s share of the cost of the equipment in which
it participates with other partnerships at December 31, 2015 was
approximately $885,000 and is included in the Partnership s
equipment on its balance sheet. The Partnership s share of
the outstanding debt associated with this equipment at December 31,
2015 was approximately $188,000 and is included in the
Partnership s notes payable on its balance sheet. The total
cost of the equipment shared by the Partnership with other
partnerships at December 31, 2015 was approximately $3,068,000. The
total outstanding debt related to the equipment shared by the
Partnership at December 31, 2015 was approximately
$608,000. 

The following is a schedule of future minimum rentals on
non-cancellable operating leases at September 30,
2016: 

The Partnership s operational phase officially ended on
December 31, 2015 and the Fund is set to expire on December 31,
2017. If the Partnership should expire with a portfolio of active
leases, the General Partner will assume ownership of the remaining
active leases and any associated debt obligation for the duration
of the remaining lease term.

The
following lists the components of the net investment in direct
financing leases: 

We assess credit risk for all of our customers, including those
that lease under finance leases. This credit risk is assessed using
an internally developed model which incorporates credits scores
from third party providers and our own customer risk ratings and is
periodically reviewed. Our internal ratings are weighted based on
the industry that the customer operates in. Factors taken into
consideration when assessing risk includes both general and
industry specific qualitative and quantitative metrics. We
separately take in to consideration payment history, open lawsuits,
liens and judgments. Typically, we will not extend credit to a
company that has been in business for less than 5 years or that has
filed for bankruptcy within the same period. Our internally based
model may classify a company as high risk based on our analysis of
their audited financial statements. Additional considerations of
high risk may include history of late payments, open lawsuits and
liens or judgments. In an effort to mitigate risk, we typically
require deposits from those in this category. The following table
presents the credit risk profile, by creditworthiness category, of
our direct finance lease receivables at September 30,

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we determined that
we did not have a need for an allowance for uncollectible accounts
associated with any of our finance leases, as the customer payment
histories with us, associated with these leases, has been
positive. 

CCC, on behalf of the Partnership and on behalf of other affiliated
companies and partnerships ( partnerships ), acquires
equipment subject to associated debt obligations and lease
agreements and allocates a participation in the cost, debt and
lease revenue to the various companies based on certain risk
factors.  

The following is a schedule of future minimum rentals on
non-cancelable direct financing leases at September 30,
2016: 

The Partnership s operational phase officially ended on
December 31, 2015 and the Fund is set to expire on December 31,
2017. If the Partnership should expire, the General Partner will
assume all remaining active leases at their fair market value and
related remaining revenue stream and any associated debt obligation
for the duration of the remaining lease term.

4. Related Party Transactions 

Receivables/Payables 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no CCC
cash contributions paid to the Partnership or forgiveness of
payables owed to it.  During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, CCC forgave approximately $45,000 of payables owed to it
by the Partnership, made capital contributions of equipment and
finance leases of approximately $11,000 and cash contributions to
the Partnership of approximately $8,000. 

As
of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s related party
receivables and payables are short term, unsecured and non-interest
bearing.

Reimbursable expenses  

Reimbursable
expenses, which are charged to the partnership by CCC in connection
with the administration and operation of the Partnership, are
allocated to the Partnership based upon several factors including,
but not limited to, the number of investors, compliance issues, and
the number of existing leases.  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, no other LP expense was charged to the
Partnership. 

$  57,000

Equipment acquisition fee  

The General Partner
earned an equipment acquisition fee of 4% of the purchase price of
each item of equipment purchased as compensation for the
negotiation of the acquisition of the equipment and lease thereof
or sale under a conditional sales contract. At September 30, 2016,
all prepaid equipment acquisition fees were earned by the General
Partner.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
approximately $2,000 of acquisition fees earned from operating
leases was waived by the General Partner.

Equipment management fee  

The General Partner
is entitled to be paid a monthly fee equal to the lesser of (i) the
fees which would be charges by and independent third party for
similar services for similar equipment or (ii) the sum of (a) two
percent of (1) the gross lease revenues attributable to equipment
which is subject to full payout net leases which contain net lease
provisions plus (2) the purchase price paid on conditional sales
contracts as received by the Partnership and (b) 5% of the gross
lease revenues attributable to equipment which is subject to
operating and capital leases.  For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, equipment management fees of
approximately $38,000 and $20,000 were earned but were waived by
the General Partner, respectively. 

$  -    

$  -    

Equipment liquidation fee  

With respect to
each item of equipment sold by the General Partner (other than in
connection with a conditional sales contract), a fee equal to the
lesser of (i) 50% of the competitive equipment sale commission or
(ii) three percent of the sales price for such equipment is payable
to the General Partner. The payment of such fee is subordinated to
the receipt by the limited partners of (i) a return of their net
capital contributions and a 10% per annum cumulative return,
compounded daily, on adjusted capital contribution and (ii) the net
disposition proceeds from such sale in accordance with the
Partnership Agreement. Such fee will be reduced to the extent any
liquidation of resale fees is paid to unaffiliated parties.
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
approximately $200 and $1,000 of equipment liquidation fees were
waived by the General Partner, respectively. 

$  -    

$  -    

Debt placement fee  

As compensation for
arranging term debt to finance our acquisition of equipment, we
will pay the general partner a fee equal to one percent of such
indebtedness; provided, however, that such fee shall be reduced to
the extent we incur such fees to third parties unaffiliated with
the general partner or the lender with respect to such
indebtedness. No such fee will be paid with respect to borrowings
from the general partner or its affiliates. We intend to initially
acquire leases on an all cash basis with the proceeds of this
offering, but may borrow funds after the offering proceeds have
been invested. The amount we borrow, and therefore the amount of
the fee, will depend upon interest rates at the time of a loan, and
the amount of leverage we determine is appropriate at the time. We
do not intend to use more than 30% leverage overall in our
portfolio. Fees will increase as the amount of leverage we use
increases, and as turnover in the portfolio increases and
additional equipment is purchased using leverage.  For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately $200
and $15,000 of debt placement fees were earned but were waived by
the General Partner, respectively.

5. Notes Payable 

Notes payable consisted of the following approximate
amounts: 

14 

The notes are secured by specific equipment with a carrying value
of approximately $2,136,000 as of September 30, 2016 and are
nonrecourse liabilities of the Partnership.  As such, the
notes do not contain any financial debt covenants with which we
must comply on either an annual or quarterly basis.  Aggregate
maturities of notes payable for each of the periods subsequent to
September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

During 2015, the General Partner executed a collateralized debt
financing agreement on behalf of certain affiliates for a total
shared loan amount of approximately $847,000, of which the
Partnership s share was approximately $52,000. The
Partnership s portion of the current loan amount at September
30, 2016 was approximately $29,000 and is secured by specific
equipment under both operating and finance leases. The carrying
value of the secured equipment under operating leases is
approximately $17,000.  The carrying value of the secured
equipment under finance leases is approximately
$32,000. 

The
Partnership s operational phase officially ended on December
31, 2015 and the Fund is set to expire on December 31, 2017. If the
Partnership should expire with a portfolio of active leases, the
General Partner will assume the obligation related to the remaining
notes payable for the duration of the remaining lease
term.

6. Supplemental Cash Flow Information 

Other noncash activities included in the determination of net
(loss) income are as follows: 

No interest or principal on notes payable was paid by the
Partnership because direct payment was made by lessee to the bank
in lieu of collection of lease income and payment of interest and
principal by the Partnership. 

Noncash investing and financing activities include the
following: 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Partnership wrote-off fully amortized acquisition fees of
approximately $8,000 and $4,000, respectively.

7. Commitments and Contingencies 

Investor Complaint 

On November 10, 2015, certain investors (the
 Claimants ) of Commonwealth Income   Growth Fund V
( CIGF5 ) and Commonwealth Income   Growth Private
Fund III ( CIGPF3 ) (Collectively referred to as the
 Funds ), filed an investor complaint with FINRA naming
CCSC and Ms. Springsteen-Abbott (the
 Respondents ).  The Claimants, at the advice and
recommendation of their personal financial advisors, purchased
limited partnership units in CIGF5 between February 2005 and
February 2006 and in CIGPF3 between April 2005 and February
2007.  The Claimants allege that the Respondents did not
properly perform their duties as fund manager.  The Funds are
not members of FINRA and/or subject to its jurisdiction and
therefore the Respondents have in turn filed a complaint against
the Claimants in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland to enjoin the Claimants from proceeding with the
arbitration and requiring its dismissal.  The Claimants
withdrew its complaint with FINRA. The Respondents dismissed the
compliant in Federal court given the withdrawal of the FINRA
claim. 

On September 28, 2016, 23 investors, in addition to the original
Claimants (the  Florida Claimants ) filed a complaint
in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Florida,   Albers et al. v.
Commonwealth Capital Corp. et al  ., Case No. 6:16-cv-01713-Orl-37DCI, against the
Partnership, Commonwealth Income   Growth Private Fund I,
Commonwealth Income   Growth Private Fund II, CIGPF3 and CIGF5.
 The allegation consists of breach of contract, securities
fraud, misstatement in the prospectus, fraudulent concealment,
negligence, common law fraud (the  Original
Complaint ).  On October 18, 2016, the judge dismissed
the Original Complaint without prejudice with leave to refile. The
judge dismissed the Original Complaint for procedural failures. On
October 28, 2016, the Florida Claimants filed an amended complaint
that included the original claims with the addition of claims for
negligent supervision and breach of industry standards
( Amended Complaint ). The Respondents  counsel
believes the allegations in the Amended Complaint fail to meet
procedural requirements and are without merit, including the lapse
of the statute of limitations on certain claims. The Respondents
intend to file a motion to dismiss.  Management believes that
resolution of the matter will not result in any adverse financial
impact to the Partnership.  

FINRA 

On May 3, 2013, the FINRA Department of Enforcement filed a
complaint naming Commonwealth Capital Securities Corp.
( CCSC ) and the owner of the firm, Kimberly
Springsteen-Abbott, as respondents; however on October 22, 2013,
FINRA filed an amended complaint that dropped the allegations
against CCSC and reduced the scope of the allegations against Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott.  The sole remaining charge was that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott had approved the misallocation of some expenses
to certain Funds. Management believes that the expenses at issue
include amounts that were proper and that were properly allocated
to Funds, and also identified a smaller number of expenses that had
been allocated in error, but were adjusted and repaid to the
affected Funds when they were identified in 2012.  During the
period in question, Commonwealth Capital Corp. ( CCC )
and Ms. Springsteen-Abbott provided important financial support to
the Funds, voluntarily absorbed expenses and voluntarily waived
fees in amounts aggregating in excess of any questioned
allocations.  That Panel ruled on March 30, 2015, that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott should be barred from the securities industry
because the Panel concluded that she allegedly misallocated
$208,000 of expenses involving certain Funds over the course of
three years.  As such, management has allocated approximately
$87,000 of the $208,000 in allegedly misallocated expenses back to
the affected funds as a contingency accrual in CCC s
financial statements and a good faith payment for the benefit of
those Income Funds.  Decisions issued by FINRA's Office of
Hearing Officers may be appealed to FINRA's National Adjudicatory
Council (NAC) pursuant to FINRA Rule 9311.  The NAC Decision
upheld the Panel s ruling.  Ms. Springsteen-Abbott has
appealed the NAC Decision to the SEC.   While a decision is on
appeal with the SEC, the sanctions for disgorgement and fines are
not enforced against the individual.  The bar took effect on
August 23, 2016.  Management believes that resolution of the
appeal will not result in any material adverse financial impact on
the Funds, but no assurance can be provided until the FINRA matter
is resolved.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 

The Equipment Leasing and Finance Association's (ELFA) Monthly
Leasing and Finance Index (MLFI-25), which reports economic
activity from 25 companies representing a cross section of the $1
trillion equipment finance sector, showed their overall new
business volume for September was $9.4 billion, up 12%
year-over-year from new business volume in September 2015. Volume
was up 22% month-to-month from $7.7 billion in August. Year to
date, cumulative new business volume decreased 4% compared to
2015.  

ELFA President and CEO Ralph Petta said, "September new business
volume was strong, showing the first double-digit increase in many
months. Perhaps the Fed's decision to keep interest rates low has
contributed to this favorable environment for equipment investment
by businesses. The uncertainty caused by the upcoming Presidential
election, which has acted as a drag on overall economic growth and
low capital spending for most of this year, seems to have waned- at
least in the short term. It will be interesting to see if this
scenario continues into the final quarter.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our financial statements which have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
We base these estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

We
believe that our critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
financial statements. See Note 2 to our condensed financial
statements included herein for a discussion of recent accounting
pronouncements. 

LEASE INCOME RECEIVABLE 

Lease
income receivable includes current lease income receivable net of
allowances for uncollectible amounts. The Partnership monitors
lease income receivable to ensure timely and accurate payment by
lessees. Its Lease Relations department is responsible for
monitoring lease income receivable and, as necessary, resolving
outstanding invoices. 

The
Partnership reviews a customer s credit history before
extending credit. The Partnership may establish an allowance for
uncollectible lease income receivable based upon the credit risk of
specific customers, historical trends and other information when
the analysis indicates that the probability of full collection is
unlikely. The Partnership writes off its accounts receivable when
it determines that it is uncollectible and all economically
sensible means have been exhausted. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION 

Through September 30, 2016, the Partnership s lease portfolio
consisted of operating and finance leases. For operating leases,
lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance
with the terms of the lease agreements. 

Finance lease interest income is recorded over the term of the
lease using the effective interest method. For finance leases, we
record, at lease inception, unearned finance lease income which is
calculated as follows: total lease payments, plus any residual
values and initial direct costs, less the cost of the leased
equipment. 

Upon the end of the lease term, if the lessee has not met the
return conditions as set out in the lease, the Partnership is
entitled, in certain cases, to additional compensation from the
lessee. The Partnership s accounting policy for recording
such payments is to treat them as revenue. 

Gain or losses from sales of leased and off lease equipment are
recorded on a net basis in the Fund s condensed Statement of
Operations. 

Our leases do not contain any step-rent provisions or escalation
clauses nor are lease revenues adjusted based on any
index. 

Gains from the termination of leases are recognized when the lease
is modified and terminated concurrently.  Gains from lease
termination included in lease revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $1,000 and $4,000,
respectively. 

19 

LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

Depreciation
on equipment for financial statement purposes is based on the
straight-line method estimated generally over useful lives of two
to four years. Once an asset comes off lease or is re-leased, the
Partnership reassesses the useful life of an asset. 

The
Partnership evaluates its long-lived assets when events or
circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may not be
recoverable. The Partnership determines whether impairment exists
by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by each
asset. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the
carrying value of the asset then impairment exists. The amount of
the impairment is determined based on the difference between the
carrying value and the fair value. Fair value is determined based
on estimated discounted cash flows to be generated by the asset,
third party appraisals or comparable sales of similar assets, as
applicable, based on asset type. 

Residual
values are determined by management and are calculated using
information from both internal and external sources, as well as
other economic indicators. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Sources and Uses of Cash 

Our
primary sources of cash for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 were cash provided by operating activities of approximately
$21,000, cash proceeds from the sale of equipment of approximately
$7,000 and payments received from finance leases of approximately
$13,000.  This compares to the nine months ended September 30,
2015 where our primary sources of cash were cash provided by
operating activities of approximately $257,000, cash proceeds from
the sale of equipment of approximately $34,000, payments received
from finance leases of approximately $9,000 and cash contributions
from CCC of approximately $8,000. 

O  ur
primary use of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was for the purchase of new equipment of approximately $30,000.
 Our primary uses of cash for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 were for the purchase of new equipment of approximately
$296,000 and the purchase of finance leases of approximately
$10,000. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash was provided by
operating activities of approximately $21,000, which includes net
loss of approximately $35,000 and depreciation and amortization
expenses of approximately $669,000.  Other non-cash activities
included in the determination of net income were direct payments of
lease income by lessees to banks of approximately
$627,000. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash was provided by
operating activities of approximately $257,000, which includes net
loss of approximately $27,000, gain on sale of equipment of
approximately $8,000 and depreciation and amortization expenses of
approximately $371,000.  Other non-cash activities included in
the determination of net income were direct payments of lease
income by lessees to banks of approximately $163,000. 

At September 30, 2016, cash was held in one bank account maintained
at one financial institution with a balance of approximately
$19,000. Bank accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 by the
FDIC. At September 30, 2016, the total cash bank balance was as
follows: 

20 

The
Partnership s bank balances are fully insured by the FDIC.
The Partnership deposits its funds with a Moody's Aaa-Rated banking
institution which is one of only three Aaa-Rated banks listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Partnership has not experienced
any losses in such accounts, and believes it is not exposed to any
significant credit risk. The amount in such accounts will fluctuate
throughout 2016 due to many factors, including cash receipts,
interest rates, and distribution to limited
partners.  

Our investment strategy of acquiring equipment and generally
leasing it under triple-net leases to operators who generally meet
specified financial standards minimizes our operating expenses.
 As of September 30, 2016, we had future minimum rentals on
non-cancelable leases of approximately $245,000 for the balance of
the year ending December 31, 2016 and approximately $1,425,000
thereafter.  As of September 30, 2016, we had future minimum
rentals on non-cancelable finance leases of approximately $4,000
for the balance of the year ending December 31, 2016 and
approximately $25,000 thereafter.   

As of September 30, 2016, our non-recourse debt was approximately
$1,554,000, with interest rates ranging from 1.60% through 6.00%
and will be payable through December 2019. During 2015, the General
Partner executed a collateralized debt financing agreement on
behalf of certain affiliates for a total shared loan amount of
approximately $847,000, of which the Partnership s share was
approximately $52,000. The Partnership s portion of the
current loan amount at September 30, 2016 was approximately $29,000
and is secured by specific equipment under both operating and
finance leases. The carrying value of the secured equipment under
operating leases is approximately $17,000.  The carrying value
of the secured equipment under finance leases is approximately
$32,000. 

Commonwealth Capital Corp., on our behalf and on behalf of other
affiliated partnerships, acquires equipment subject to associated
debt obligations and lease revenue and allocates a participation in
the cost, debt and lease revenue to the various partnerships based
on certain risk factors. 

Our cash from operations is expected to continue to be adequate to
cover all operating expenses and liabilities during the next
12-month period. The General Partner continues to suspend limited
partner distributions for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
 The General Partner will reassess the funding of limited
partner distributions on a quarterly basis, throughout 2016. The
General Partner and CCC will also determine if related party
payables owed to them by the Partnership may be deferred (if deemed
necessary) in an effort to increase the Partnership s cash
flow.   

The Partnership was originally scheduled to end its operational
phase on December 31, 2013.  During the year ended December
31, 2013, the operational phase was officially extended to December
31, 2015 through a proxy vote initiated by the General
Partner.  The Partnership s operational phase ended on
December 31, 2015.  The Fund is scheduled to expire on
December 31, 2017.  The General Partner has not formally
approved a plan for liquidation at this time.  As such, the
Partnership will continue to report its financial statements on a
going concern basis until a formal plan of liquidation is approved
by the General Partner. 

In an effort to increase cash flow, the General Partner elected to
forgo distributions and allocations of net income owed to it, and
suspended limited partner distributions during the three months
ended September 30, 2016. The General Partner and  CCC also
waived certain fees owed to them by the Partnership in an effort to
further support the Partnership. 

The
General Partner and CCC have committed to fund, either through cash
contributions and/or forgiveness of indebtedness, any necessary
operational cash shortfalls of the Partnership through December 31,
2016. The General Partner will continue to reassess the funding of
limited partner distributions throughout 2016 and will continue to
waive certain fees if the General Partner determines it is in the
best interest of the Partnership to do so. If available cash flow
or net disposition proceeds are insufficient to cover the
Partnership expenses and liabilities on a short and long term
basis, the Partnership may attempt to obtain additional funds by
disposing of or refinancing equipment, or by borrowing within its
permissible limits.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months
Ended September 30, 2015 

Lease Revenue 

Lease revenue increased to approximately $249,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, from $207,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an
increase in the number and size of active leases generating lease
revenue for the Partnership. 

The Partnership had 105 and 103 active operating leases that
generated lease revenue of approximately $249,000 and $207,000
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  Management does not expect to acquire new
leases as the Partnership s operational phase ended on
December 31, 2015. 

Sale of Equipment 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership had
no equipment sales.  For the three months ended September 30,
2015, the Partnership sold equipment with net book value of
approximately $26,000 for a net gain of approximately
$7,000. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses, excluding depreciation, primarily consist
of accounting, legal, outside service fees and reimbursement of
expenses to CCC, a related party, for administration and operation
of the Partnership. Operating expenses were approximately $12,000
and $7,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  This change is primarily due to an increase in
accounting fees and financial reporting expenses as a result of a
change in software used for SEC electronic filing of approximately
$3,000 and investor service expenses of approximately
$3,000. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on
equipment and amortization of equipment acquisition
fees.  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately
$221,000 and $184,000, respectively.  As the number of active
leases held by the Partnership increases, depreciation and
amortization expense is expected to increase.  As the number
of active leases held by the Partnership increased, depreciation
and amortization expense increased as well.  The increase in
depreciation and amortization expense is consistent with the
increase in active leases and equipment acquisitions. 

Net Loss 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized
revenue of approximately $250,000 and expenses of approximately
$253,000, resulting in net loss of approximately $3,000.  For
the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized revenue of
approximately $214,000 and expenses of approximately $195,000,
resulting in net income of approximately $19,000.  This change
in net loss is primarily due to the changes in revenue and expenses
as described above. 

22 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2015 

Lease Revenue 

Lease revenue increased to approximately $757,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, from $399,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an
increase in the size of active leases generating lease revenue for
the Partnership. 

The Partnership had 113 and 114 active operating leases that
generated lease revenue of approximately $757,000 and $399,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  Management does not expect to acquire new
leases as the Partnership s operational phase ended on
December 31, 2015. 

Sale of Equipment 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership sold
equipment held under operating leases with net book value of
approximately $6,000, for a net gain of approximately $1,000.
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Partnership
sold equipment with net book value of approximately $26,000 for a
net gain of approximately $8,000. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses, excluding depreciation, primarily consist
of accounting, legal, outside service fees and reimbursement of
expenses to CCC, a related party, for administration and operation
of the Partnership. These expenses increased to approximately
$63,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$53,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This
change is primarily due to an increase in accounting fees and
financial reporting expenses of approximately $9,000 as a result of
a change in software used for SEC electronic filing. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense 

Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on
equipment and amortization of equipment acquisition fees.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $669,000 and
$371,000, respectively.  The increase in depreciation and
amortization expense is consistent with the increase in active
leases and equipment acquisitions. 

Net Loss 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized revenue
of approximately $760,000 and expenses of approximately $795,000,
resulting in a net loss of approximately $35,000.  For the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized revenue of
approximately $410,000 and expenses of approximately $437,000,
resulting in net loss of approximately $27,000.  This change
in net income is primarily due to the changes in revenue and
expenses as described above.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

N/A 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, under the supervision and with the participation of the
General Partner s Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures related to our reporting and
disclosure obligations as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, the
General Partner s Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016,
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring
that information relating to us which is required to be disclosed
in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is (a) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (b) accumulated
and communicated to management, including the General
Partner s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. There were no changes in the
Partnership s internal control over financial reporting
during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control
over financial reporting. 

Part II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.
 Legal
Proceedings  

Investor Complaint 

On
November 10, 2015, certain investors (the  Claimants )
of Commonwealth Income   Growth Fund V ( CIGF5 )
and Commonwealth Income   Growth Private Fund III
( CIGPF3 ) (Collectively referred to as the
 Funds ), filed an investor complaint with FINRA naming
CCSC and Ms. Springsteen-Abbott (the
 Respondents ).  The Claimants, at the advice and
recommendation of their personal financial advisors, purchased
limited partnership units in CIGF5 between February 2005 and
February 2006 and in CIGPF3 between April 2005 and February
2007.  The Claimants allege that the Respondents did not
properly perform their duties as fund manager.  The Funds are
not members of FINRA and/or subject to its jurisdiction. The
Respondents filed a complaint on December 23, 2015, against the
Claimants in the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland to enjoin the Claimants from proceeding with the
arbitration and requiring its dismissal.  The Claimants
withdrew its complaint with FINRA on July 27, 2016.  On August
1, 2016, the Respondents were granted voluntary dismissal in
Federal court given the withdrawal of the FINRA claim. 

On September 28, 2016, 23 investors, in addition to the original
Claimants (the  Florida Claimants ) filed a complaint
in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Florida,   Albers et al. v.
Commonwealth Capital Corp. et al  ., Case No. 6:16-cv-01713-Orl-37DCI, against the
Partnership, Commonwealth Income   Growth Private Fund I,
Commonwealth Income   Growth Private Fund II, CIGPF3 and CIGF5.
 The allegation consists of breach of contract, securities
fraud, misstatement in the prospectus, fraudulent concealment,
negligence, common law fraud (the  Original
Complaint ).  On October 18, 2016, the judge dismissed
the Original Complaint without prejudice with leave to refile. The
judge dismissed the Original Complaint for procedural failures. On
October 28, 2016, the Florida Claimants filed an amended complaint
that included the original claims with the addition of claims for
negligent supervision and breach of industry standards
( Amended Complaint ). The Respondents  counsel
believes the allegations in the Amended Complaint fail to meet
procedural requirements and are without merit, including the lapse
of the statute of limitations on certain claims. The Respondents
intend to file a motion to dismiss.  Management believes that
resolution of the matter will not result in any adverse financial
impact to the Partnership.  

FINRA 

On May 3, 2013, the FINRA Department of Enforcement filed a
complaint naming Commonwealth Capital Securities Corp.
( CCSC ) and the owner of the firm, Kimberly
Springsteen-Abbott, as respondents; however on October 22, 2013,
FINRA filed an amended complaint that dropped the allegations
against CCSC and reduced the scope of the allegations against Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott.  The sole remaining charge was that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott had approved the misallocation of some expenses
to certain Funds. Management believes that the expenses at issue
include amounts that were proper and that were properly allocated
to Funds, and also identified a smaller number of expenses that had
been allocated in error, but were adjusted and repaid to the
affected Funds when they were identified in 2012.  During the
period in question, Commonwealth Capital Corp. ( CCC )
and Ms. Springsteen-Abbott provided important financial support to
the Funds, voluntarily absorbed expenses and voluntarily waived
fees in amounts aggregating in excess of any questioned
allocations.  That Panel ruled on March 30, 2015, that Ms.
Springsteen-Abbott should be barred from the securities industry
because the Panel concluded that she allegedly misallocated
$208,000 of expenses involving certain Funds over the course of
three years.  As such, management has allocated approximately
$87,000 of the $208,000 in allegedly misallocated expenses back to
the affected funds as a contingency accrual in CCC s
financial statements and a good faith payment for the benefit of
those Income Funds.  Decisions issued by FINRA's Office of
Hearing Officers may be appealed to FINRA's National Adjudicatory
Council (NAC) pursuant to FINRA Rule 9311.  The NAC Decision
upheld the Panel s ruling.  Ms. Springsteen-Abbott has
appealed the NAC Decision to the SEC.   While a decision is on
appeal with the SEC, the sanctions for disgorgement and fines are
not enforced against the individual.  The bar took effect on
August 23, 2016.  Management believes that resolution of the
appeal will not result in any material adverse financial impact on
the Funds, but no assurance can be provided until the FINRA matter
is resolved.
