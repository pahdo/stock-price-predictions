  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS   

  (UNAUDITED)  

1.      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates     

  Basis
of Presentation and Organization and Reorganization  

EnergyTek Corp., is a Nevada corporation which
has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Texas Gulf Exploration   Production, Inc., and Legal Capital Corp.  In January 2015,
EnergyTek Corp. entered into a Joint Venture with Wagley Offshore-Onshore, Inc. to acquire distressed energy assets. In July 2016,
the Company entered into an agreement to terminate this Joint Venture and it was dissolved on September 26, 2016. Effective September
13, 2016, EnergyTek Corp. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ( Merger Agreement ) through which it acquired
Timefire, LLC (Timefire), a Phoenix-based virtual reality content developer that is an Arizona Limited Liability Company. As consideration
for the merger, EnergyTek Corp. issued the equity holders of Timefire a total of 414,000,000 shares of its common stock, and 28,000,000
five year warrants exercisable at $0.058 per share for 100% of the membership interests of Timefire. As a result, the former members
of Timefire owned approximately 99% of the then outstanding shares of common stock. The consolidated entities hereinafter are referred
to as the  Company.  The operations of the Company from the acquisition date represent the business of Timefire. 

For accounting purposes the transaction is
being recorded as a reverse acquisition, with Timefire as the accounting acquirer. The 414,000,000 shares of common stock issued
in the transaction are shown as outstanding for all periods presented in the same manner as a stock split. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements reflect the consolidated operations of the company from September 13, 2016. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Statements  

The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for the periods then ended, are prepared in accordance with the
instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto do not reflect
all disclosures required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. However, in the opinion
of management, the interim financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary
to present fairly the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for
the year ended December 31, 2016. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the latest annual financial statements. 

Principles of Consolidation  

 The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated. Equity investments through which we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not
the primary beneficiary of the investee's activities are accounted for using the equity method where applicable. 

Accounting Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Significant estimates of the Company include accounting for depreciation
and amortization, derivative liability, accruals and contingencies, the fair value of Company common stock and the estimated fair
value of warrants. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company uses Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 605 for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes
revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all
of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
and (iii) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments,
with original maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. 

Escrow Fund  

Pursuant to the Series A Preferred Stock Securities
Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) (see Note 7), the Company was required to hold an initial amount of $215,000 in cash in escrow.
The cash is restricted to be used for certain expenses as defined in the agreement. In addition, for the 24 months following the
closing of the SPA, the Company is required to deposit 15% of the gross proceeds of any offering of securities with the Company
or any cash exercise of any common stock equivalents, including cash proceeds from the exercise of any warrants issued to investors
involved with the SPA. As of September 30, 2016, $250 has been disbursed from the escrow account, leaving a remaining balance of
$214,750. 

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is provided for on the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs
that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Betterments
or renewals are capitalized when incurred. Gains and losses on the disposition of property and equipment are recorded in the period
incurred. 

The estimated useful lives of property and
equipment are: 

Of fice furniture and equipment  5 years   

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and Amortizable Intangible Assets  

The Company follows ASC 360-10,   Property,
Plant, and Equipment,   which established a   primary asset   approach to determine the cash flow estimation
period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long-lived asset to be held and used.
Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds
the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Long-lived assets
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. 

Intangible Assets - Goodwill  

The excess of the purchase price over net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets of the business acquired is carried as Goodwill on the balance sheet. Goodwill is not amortized,
but instead is assessed for impairment at least annually and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes
in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. Measurement of the impairment loss, if any, is
based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of reporting unit. The goodwill impairment test follows a two-step
process. In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting
unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. In the
second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine
an implied goodwill value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill,
an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company
did not recognize any impairment charges. 

Business segments  

ASC 280,   Segment Reporting  
requires use of the   management approach   model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based
on the way a company's management organizes segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.
The Company determined it has one operating segment as of September 30, 2016. 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income taxes under
FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes . Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. 

Net Loss per Share  

Basic earnings per share does not include dilution
and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an
entity. Dilutive securities are not included in the weighted average number of shares when inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Due
to the net losses for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, basic and diluted loss per common share were the same, as
the effect of potentially dilutive securities would have been anti-dilutive. 

As of September 30, 2016, there was
a total of 221,199,427 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of preferred stock and the exercise of warrants and vesting
of restricted stock units that were not included in the earnings per share calculation as they were anti-dilutive. 

Fair Value Measurements  

ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure about
fair value measurements. 

The following provides an analysis of financial
instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to
which fair value is observable: 

Level 1- fair value measurements are those
derived from quoted prices (unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); 

Level 2- fair value measurements are those
derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 

Level 3- fair value measurements are those
derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs). 

Financial instruments classified as Level 1
- quoted prices in active markets include cash. 

These financial instruments are measured using
management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management
judgment to estimation. Valuations based on unobservable inputs are highly subjective and require significant judgments. Changes
in such judgments could have a material impact on fair value estimates. In addition, since estimates are as of a specific point
in time, they are susceptible to material near-term changes. Changes in economic conditions may also dramatically affect the estimated
fair values. 

Fair value estimates discussed herein are based
upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016. The respective carrying
value of certain financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. These
financial instruments include cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Subsequent Events  

In accordance with ASC 855  Subsequent
Events  the Company evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date. 

2.      Going Concern     

 The Company has incurred losses since
inception and requires additional funds for future operating activities. The Company s selling activity has not reached a
level of revenue sufficient to fund its operating activities. These factors create an uncertainty as to how the Company will fund
its operations and maintain sufficient cash flow to operate as a going concern. The combination of these factors, among others,
raise doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

 The Company s ability to meet its cash
requirements in the next year is dependent upon obtaining additional financing. If this is not achieved, the Company may be unable
to obtain sufficient cash flow to fund its operations and obligations, and as a result there is substantial doubt the Company will
be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, and accordingly, do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts; nor do they include adjustments to the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue operations or be required to sell its assets. 

3.      Reverse Acquisition     

The Company accounted for the Merger Agreement
with Timefire as a reverse acquisition, with Timefire being the accounting acquirer. In its determination that Timefire was the
accounting acquirer, the Company considered pertinent facts and circumstances, including the following: (i) the Timefire owners
received the largest portion of the voting rights of the combined entity; (ii) the management team of the combined entity is primarily
comprised of owners or management of Timefire; (iii) the Board of Directors of the combined entity is primarily comprised of owners,
management or affiliates of Timefire; (iv) the continuing business of the combined entity will be the business of Timefire. In
accounting for the reverse acquisition, the Company considered the market price of its common stock to be the most reliable measure
of the consideration effectively transferred. On the acquisition date the price of the Company's common stock was $0.0452 per
share and the number of shares of common stock outstanding, including common stock issuable upon the conversion of outstanding
convertible preferred stock, amounted to 131,758,655 shares which resulted in the fair value of the consideration equaling $5,955,491.
The net liabilities at the acquisition date totaled $204,738, resulting in goodwill of $6,160,229. None of the goodwill is expected
to be deductible for income tax purposes. 

The amount of net loss of the accounting acquiree
included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, September 13, 2016, to the period ending
September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

The following supplemental pro forma information
presents the consolidated financial results as if the acquisition of the accounting acquiree had occurred January 1, 2015. 

4.      Notes Payable to Related Parties     

Notes payable to related parties consist of
amounts owed by Texas Gulf Exploration   Production, Inc. to parties related to the Company. As a term of the Merger Agreement,
Texas Gulf Exploration   Production, Inc. will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Litigation Capital, Inc, a non-related entity,
once certain requirements have been met, and the debt will be assumed by that entity. 

5.      Related Party Transactions    

During the year ended December 31, 2015,
the Company entered into an agreement with a related party, an entity in which two of the Timefire members have significant ownership,
to provide software development services.  During 2015, the Company received $156,000 in payments for these services. 
The contracted services had not yet been completed as of December 31, 2015, and all amounts received were classified as unearned
revenue.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company completed this work, recognizing the previously unearned
revenue from 2015 as well as an additional $46,500, for a total of $202,500 in revenue from the related party. 

6.      Commitments and Contingencies    

Employment Agreements  

Effective September 13, 2016, the Company
entered into an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ). The agreement is for a two year period
at the rate of $150,000 per annum. The agreement will be automatically extended for additional terms of one year each unless terminated
by either party.  In addition to other customary benefits, the CEO was granted 5,000,000 restricted stock units ( RSUs ).  The
RSUs vest over a 2 year period (see Note 7). 

 Effective September 13, 2016, the Company
entered into an employment agreement with its new President. The agreement is for a two year period at the rate of $150,000 per
annum. The agreement will be automatically extended for additional terms of one year each unless terminated by either party. 

 Effective September 13, 2016, the Company
entered into an employment agreement with its new Chief Strategy Officer. The agreement is for a two year period at the rate of
$150,000 per annum. The agreement will be automatically extended for additional terms of one year each unless terminated by
either party. 

  Lease Agreements  

On September 23, 2016, the Company entered
into an office lease agreement commencing October 1, 2016 for a new location, after having outgrown the prior facility.  This
lease expires December 31, 2018.  A concession of the first five months  rent was provided.  After that time, the
monthly rent will be $8,121 for months 6 through 17, and $8,375 for months 18 through 27.  The Company continues to be obligated
to pay the monthly rent of $2,596 on its prior facility lease, which expires January 2017, unless the landlord enters into a lease
with a new tenant prior to that date. 

7.      Shareholders  Deficit and Series A Preferred
Stock    

Common Stock  

There is currently only one class of common
stock. Each share common stock is entitled to one vote. The authorized number of shares of common stock of the Company at September

to 430,087,964 as of September 30, 2016. 

On September 13, 2016, the Company entered
into a Merger Agreement through which the Company acquired Timefire (See Note 1). As consideration for the merger, the Company
issued the equity holders of Timefire a total of 414,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and 28,000,000 five year
warrants exercisable at $0.058 per share for 100% of the membership interests of Timefire. The members of Timefire may also be
entitled to additional warrants contingent on certain future financings, as defined in the Merger Agreement. 

Preferred Stock  

The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000
shares of Preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, with rights, preferences and limitations as may be decided from

900 Shares of previously issued Series A Preferred Stock ( Prior Series A ). Each share of Series C shall be convertible
at the option of the holder at any time, into 100,000 shares of common stock. Each holder of Series C shall be entitled to one
vote for each share of Series C held.  Holders cannot convert their Series C to the extent that after such conversion, they
and their affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the Company s common stock, which limitation is waivable
upon 61 days  notice to the Company. In 2015, 10 Series C shares were converted into 1,000,000 shares of our common stock.
In 2016, holders of 137 shares of Series C converted them into 13,700,000 shares of our common stock. At September 30, 2016, there
are 753 shares of Series C outstanding.

note holders under which the note holders agreed to convert an aggregate of $229,170 in principal and accrued interest into a total
of 20,371 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A-1 shall be convertible at the option of the holder
at any time, into 1,000 shares of common stock. The Series A-1 ranks senior to the common stock and junior to the Series C. Holders
of Series A-1 are entitled to receive dividends and vote together with holders of the common stock on an as-converted basis. Holders
cannot convert their Series A-1 to the extent that after such conversion, they and their affiliates would beneficially own in excess
of 2.49% of the Company s common stock, which limitation is waivable upon 61 days  notice to the Company. At September
30, 2016, there are 20,371 shares of Series A-1 outstanding. 

Series A  

 Effective September 13, 2016, the Company closed
on a Securities Purchase Agreement and the Board of Directors approved the issuance of a newly designated Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock ( New Series A ). Pursuant to the agreement the Company issued and sold approximately 133,334 shares

Series A to the extent that after such conversion, they and their affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 2.49% of the Company s
common stock, which limitation is waivable upon 61 days  notice to the Company. In addition, the investors were issued a
total of 25,862,069 five-year warrants exercisable at $0.058 per share containing a similar 2.49% ownership blocker. At any time
after the earlier of (i) the Company having affected a one-for-six reverse stock split or combination or (ii) November 30, 2016,
each share of New Series A shall be convertible into shares of Company common stock. 

New Series A shall be convertible, at
the option of the holder, into 500 shares of common stock, subject to certain adjustments. The New Series A ranks senior to all
other classes and series of the Company's capital stock. Holders of New Series A are entitled to receive dividends and vote together
with holders of the common stock on an as-converted basis. At September 30, 2016, there are 133,334 shares of New Series A outstanding.
The Company recorded a discount of $1,500,004 as a result of a New Series A beneficial conversion feature. The beneficial conversion
feature is being amortized as a deemed dividend over the period from issuance to the earliest date the New Series A becomes convertible,
which the Company considers to be November 30, 2016 for this calculation. As of September 30, 2016, $397,591 has been accreted
as a dividend, and due to the lack of retained earnings has been offset to additional paid-in capital. 

New Series A contains certain provisions that
are outside the Company's control and which the Company believes cause the New Series A to be classified as mezzanine equity. 

Warrants  

The balance of warrants outstanding for purchase of the Company s
common stock as of September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

(1) On September 13, 2016, per the terms of
the Merger Agreement (see Note 1), the Company issued five-year warrants at $.058 to purchase 28,000,000 shares of common stock
to the original Timefire investors. Fair value of $1,194,480 is recorded in recapitalization. 

(2) On September 13, 2016, per the terms of
the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company issued five-year warrants at $.058 to purchase 25,862,069 shares of common stock
(see above). Fair value of $1,103,276 is recorded as a derivative liability and a reduction in Series A Preferred additional paid-in
capital September 30, 2016. 

The fair value of the warrants, an aggregate
of $2,297,756, is estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model using the following assumptions: dividend yield   0%; risk-free
interest rate - 1.23%; expected life   5 years; volatility 174.401%. 

  2016 Equity Incentive Plan  

Effective September 13, 2016, the Company
adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ) to provide an incentive to our employees, consultants, officers
and directors who are responsible for or contribute to our long range success. A total of 33,000,000 shares of our common stock
have been reserved for the implementation of the 2016 Plan, either through the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted awards, or restricted stock units ( RSUs ). Whenever
practical, the 2016 Plan is to be administered by a committee of not less than two members of the Board of Directors appointed
by the full Board, and the 2016 Plan has a term of ten years, unless sooner terminated by the Board. As of September 30, 2016,
28,000,000 shares of common stock are available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. 

 Effective September 13, 2016, pursuant
to his employment agreement, the Company entered into a Restricted Stock Unit Agreement with its CEO which granted the CEO 5,000,000
RSUs pursuant to the 2016 Plan. The RSUs vest in three approximately equal increments with the first tranche being fully vested
on the grant date and the remaining tranches vesting on the first-year and second-year anniversaries of the grant date. The fair
value of the award was calculated based on the price of the common stock on the grant date and is being charged to operations over
the vesting period. The expense recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is $78,472.

On November 7, 2016, the Company issued
1,246,000 shares of common stock in exchange for 12.46 shares of Series C Preferred. 

 On November 14, 2016, the Company filed
a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to change the Company's name
to TimefireVR Inc. and implement a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of one-for-10. The name change and reverse
stock split will each become effective November 21, 2016.

OVERVIEW  

EnergyTek Corp., (the Company), is a
Nevada corporation.  In January 2015 the Company entered into a Joint Venture with Wagley Offshore-Onshore, Inc. to acquire
distressed energy assets. In July 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate this Joint Venture and it was dissolved
on September 26, 2016. Effective September 13, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ( Merger Agreement )
through which the Company acquired Timefire, LLC (Timefire), a Phoenix-based virtual reality content developer that is an Arizona
Limited Liability Company. As consideration for the merger, the Company issued the equity holders of Timefire a total of 414,000,000
shares of the Company s common stock, and 28,000,000 five year warrants exercisable at $0.058 per share for 100% of the
membership interests of Timefire. As a result, the former members of Timefire owned approximately 99% of the then outstanding
shares of common stock. The operations of the Company from the acquisition date represent the business of Timefire. 

Results of Operations   

Total
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.  Operating expenses in the quarter ended September
30, 2016 amounted to $592,538 as compared to $132,396 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses
is primarily due to expenses related to the merger transaction. The net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was
$596,824 as compared to $133,083 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the difference being primarily due to the merger-related
costs. 

Total revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $203,640 as compared to $6,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This is a result of the completion
of a software development project for a related party, totaling $202,500. Operating expenses in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 amounted to $762,702 as compared to $299,465 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating
expenses is primarily due to costs related to the merger transaction as well as increased employee headcount resulting in additional
research and development costs. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $773,101 as compared to $300,619
for the nine ended September 30, 2015, the difference being primarily due to the merger-related costs and payroll expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Our
balance sheet as at September 30, 2016 reflects $774,363 in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $3,165 as at December
31, 2015.   To date, the Company has incurred operating losses and has incurred negative cash
flows from operations. Management is continuing to pursue financing from various sources, including private placements from investors
and institutions. Management believes these efforts will contribute toward funding the Company s activities until sufficient
revenue can be earned from future operations. Management believes these combined efforts, if successful, will be sufficient to
meet its working capital needs and its currently anticipated expenditure levels for the next year. At this time, our Company does
not have a commitment from any broker/dealer to provide additional financing, and does not have sufficient working capital to
support operations for the next twelve months. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available,
on terms that will be acceptable.    

Going Concern   

We have not attained profitable operations
and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors
stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as
a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates   

Our financial statements and accompanying
notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. 

We regularly evaluate the accounting
policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the
notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from
third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.
Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have no significant off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material
to stockholders. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

The Company has implemented all new
accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements
unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have
been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We are a smaller reporting company as
defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures   

Disclosure controls and procedures are
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and
with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Our management is presently working
to identify remediation measures to improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting   

Our management has also evaluated our
internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors
that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation. 

The Company is not required by current
SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has
not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS  

From time to time, the Company may become subject
to various legal proceedings that are incidental to the ordinary conduct of its business. Although the Company cannot accurately
predict the amount of any liability that may ultimately arise with respect to any of these matters, it makes provision for potential
liabilities when it deems them probable and reasonably estimable. These provisions are based on current information and legal advice
and may be adjusted from time to time according to developments. There were no material changes to our legal proceedings during
the period covered by this report.
