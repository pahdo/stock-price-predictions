Organization,
Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation    

China
Auto Logistics Inc. (the   Company   or   China Auto  ) operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary
Ever Auspicious International Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (  HKCo . ), and its wholly-owned subsidiary Tianjin
Seashore New District Shisheng Business Trading Group Co. Ltd. (  Shisheng  ), a company established under the
laws of the People s Republic of China (  PRC  ) and Shisheng s wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries,
Tianjin Ganghui Information Technology Corp. (  Ganghui  ), and Tianjin Hengjia Port Logistics Corp. (  Hengjia  ).  

The
Company s principal businesses include (i) sales of imported automobiles, (ii) financing services related to imported automobiles,
and (iii) other services including automobile information websites and advertising services, and logistics services related to
the automobile importing process and other automobile value added services, such as assistance with customs clearance, storage
and nationwide delivery services.  

On
June 1, 2016, Shisheng entered into (i) an Equity Transfer Agreement ( Equity Transfer Agreement ) with Wuxi Huitong
Automobile Sales and Service Co., Ltd. ( Huitong ) to sell 100% of the equity of Tianjin Zhonghe Automobile Sales
and Service Co., Ltd. ( Zhonghe ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company prior to this transaction, and (ii) a
Debt Transfer Agreement, dated June 1, 2016, by and among Shisheng, Huitong, and Hezhong (Tianjin) International Development Co.,
Ltd. ( Hezhong ) (the  Debt Transfer Agreement ). Zhonghe owns and operates the Airport International
Automall located in the Tianjin Airport Economic Area and owns 40% of Tianjin Car King Used Car Trading Company Ltd. ( Car
King Tianjin ). Upon the completion of this transaction, the Company relinquished ownership of the Airport International
Automall property and its 40% of Car King Tianjin. As a result, the Airport Automall Automotive Services business has been discontinued.  

The
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements and the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, has been prepared pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the   SEC  ). Certain information and note
disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (  U.S. GAAP  ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations
and the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.  

In
the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are of a normal recurring
nature and which are necessary to present fairly the financial position of China Auto as of September 30, 2016 and the results
of its operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read
in conjunction with the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The results of
operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results which
may be expected for the entire fiscal year.  

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Going
Concern    

The
Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows and may continue to generate negative cash flows as the
Company implements its business plan for 2016. There can be no assurance that the Company s continuing efforts to execute
its business plan will be successful and that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying interim
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates the Company s
continuation as a going concern. The Company s net loss from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $200,000
and $354,036 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $865,397 and $1,621,949 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $3,421,910 and net cash used in operating activities from continuing
operations of $51,395,675 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.  

On
June 1, 2016, the Company sold 100% equity interest in Zhonghe to Huitong for approximately $62.8 million and entered into a Debt
Transfer Agreement which transferred the outstanding payable balance related to the Zhonghe acquisition of approximately $36.8
million to Huitong. The Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $21.9 million (net of payable to Zhonghe of approximately
$4.1 million). The Company expects to use the cash proceeds for working capital.  

The
Company does not currently have sufficient cash or commitments for financing to sustain its operations for the next twelve months.
The Company s plan continues to be to develop new customer relationships and substantially increase our cash flows from
operations and revenue derived from our products/services. If the Company s revenues do not reach the level anticipated
in our plan, the Company may require additional financing in order to execute our operating plan. If additional financing is required,
the Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity, debt, or another form, and the Company
may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that
financing sources are not available, or that the Company is unsuccessful in increasing its revenues and profits, the Company may
be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay our debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of
which would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses in the condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company s condensed consolidated financial
statements include the collectibility of accounts receivable, the useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, goodwill
and intangible assets, the valuation of deferred tax assets and inventories and the provisions for income taxes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of China Auto and its wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in preparation of the condensed consolidated financial
statements. On June 1, 2016, the Company sold 100% of the equity interest in Zhonghe. Accordingly, Zhonghe s operating results
have been consolidated with the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements through May 31, 2016.  

6  

Currency
Reporting    

The
Company s operations in the PRC use the local currency, Renminbi (  RMB  ), as their functional currency,
whereas amounts reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures are stated in U.S. dollars,
the reporting currency of the Company, unless stated otherwise. As such, the condensed consolidated balance sheets of the Company
have been translated into U.S. dollars at the current rates as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the condensed consolidated
statements of income have been translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average rates during the periods the transactions
were recognized.  

The
resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in determining other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated
statements of comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company s main source of income was generated through (1) sales of automobiles, (2) service fees for assisting customers
to get bank financing on purchases of automobiles, (3) web-based advertising services including fees from (i) displaying graphical
advertisements on the Company websites and (ii) web-based listing services that allow customers to place automobile related information
on the Company s websites, and (4) automobile value added services.  

The
Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred upon shipment or services
have been rendered, the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.  

The
Company recognizes sales of automobiles upon delivery and acceptance by the customers and where collectibility is reasonably assured.  

Service
revenue related to financing services is recognized ratably over the financing period.  

Service
fees for graphical advertisements on the Company s websites are charged on a fixed fee basis. The Company recognizes the
advertising revenue when the service is performed over the service term. The Company charges a monthly fee for listing services
and recognizes the revenue when services are performed. The Company offers sales incentives to its customers in the form of (i)
subscription exemption, (ii) discounted prices and (iii) free advertisements. The Company classifies sales incentives as a reduction
of net revenues. Revenues, net of discounts and allowances, are recognized ratably over the service periods.  

The
Company recognizes revenue from automobile value added services when such services are performed.  

Value
added taxes (  VAT  ) represent amounts collected on behalf of specific regulatory agencies that require remittance
by a specified date. These amounts are collected at the time of sales and are detailed on invoices provided to customers. The
Company accounts for VAT on a net basis. Through April 30, 2016, the Company recorded and paid business taxes based on a percentage
of the net service revenues and reported the service revenue net of the business taxes and other sales related taxes. Effective
May 1, 2016, VAT replaced business tax in all industries, on a nationwide basis. A VAT rate of 6% applies to revenue derived
from the provision of certain services. Unlike business tax, a taxpayer is allowed to offset the qualified input VAT paid on taxable
purchases against the output VAT chargeable on the revenue from services provided. Accordingly, although the 6% VAT rate is higher
than the previously applicable 5% business tax rate, no materially different tax cost to the Company has resulted nor does the
Company expect a materially different tax cost to result from the replacement of the business tax with a VAT on the Company s
services.  

Receivables
Related to Financing Services    

The
Company records receivables related to financing services when cash is loaned to customers to finance their purchases of automobiles.
Upon repayment by customers, the Company records the amounts as reductions of receivables related to financing services. Receivables
related to financing services represent the aggregate outstanding balance of loans from customers related to their purchases of
automobiles and are considered receivables held for investment. The Company charges a fee for providing loan services and such
fees are prepaid by customers. The Company amortizes these fees over the receivable term, which is typically 90 days, using the
straight-line method. The Company records such amortized amounts as financing fee income and the unamortized amount is classified
as deferred revenue on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

7  

The
Company evaluates the collectibility of outstanding receivables at the end of each of the reporting periods and makes estimates
for potential credit losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company experienced difficulties in collecting the receivable
from a financing service customer, but the receivable was secured by certain imported automobiles. The Company took possession
of these secured automobiles and sold them during the year ended December 31, 2015. The sales proceeds were used to offset the
outstanding receivable from this customer. The Company will continue to pursue collecting the remaining receivable balance. As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded an allowance for uncollectible account on receivable related
to financing services in the amount of $2,931,307 and $3,081,331, respectively.  

Inventories

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost (using the specific identification method) or market (net realizable). We continually evaluate
the composition of our inventory, assessing slow-moving and ongoing products. Our products are comprised of the purchase cost
of automobiles which declines in value over time. We continuously evaluate our inventory to determine the reserve amount for slow-moving
inventory. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was no reserve for obsolescence.  

Basic
and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share    

Basic
earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed similarly to basic earnings
per common share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been
outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As of September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any common stock equivalents, therefore, the basic earnings (loss) per share is the
same as the diluted earnings (loss) per share.  

New
Accounting Standards    

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides a single comprehensive
model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue
recognition guidance.  The standard is effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted as of one year prior to the current effective date. The guidance permits two implementation
approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective
application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
impact of adoption on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern, Disclosures of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting
entities must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform
interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of
the entity's financial statements. Additionally, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about
the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating
the impact of adoption on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .
Under ASU 2015-17, a reporting entity is required to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. Current guidance requiring the offsetting of deferred tax assets and liabilities of a tax-paying
component of an entity and presentation as a single noncurrent amount is not affected. The standard is effective for public entities
for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted
for financial statements as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Entities may apply the update prospectively
to all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively for all periods presented. The effects of this update on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows are not expected to be material.  

8  

The
FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that
arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments
(the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases
with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not
to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases
at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Public business entities should apply
the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal
years (i.e., January 1, 2019, for a calendar year entity). Early application is permitted for all public business entities and
all nonpublic business entities upon issuance. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard
on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) . ASU No. 2016-09 simplifies several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments in this
standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption is permitted. The effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are
not expected to be material.  

The
Company is not aware of any recently issued accounting pronouncements that, when adopted, will have a material effect on the Company s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

(2)   
       Sale of Zhonghe     

On
June 1, 2016, Shisheng entered into (i) an Equity Transfer Agreement with Huitong to sell 100% of the equity of Zhonghe, and (ii)
a Debt Transfer Agreement, by and among Shisheng, Huitong, and Hezhong. Zhonghe owns and operates the Airport International Automall
located in the Tianjin Airport Economic Area and owns 40% of Car King Tianjin.  

Under
the terms of the Equity Transfer Agreement, the sale price for the Zhonghe equity was approximately $62.8 million (RMB 410,000,000).
The sale price was payable in two parts: (i) Huitong paid Shisheng approximately $26 million (RMB 169,938,192) in cash and (ii)
under the terms of the Debt Transfer Agreement, Huitong assumed Shisheng s outstanding payment obligations to Hezhong of
$36.8 million (RMB 240,061,808) under the Equity Transfer Agreement, dated November 30, 2013, by and between Hezhong and Shisheng.
Upon signing, Shisheng transferred control of Zhonghe to Huitong. Failure by either party to fulfill their obligations under the
Debt Transfer Agreement may result in the termination of the Equity Transfer Agreement, as well as a penalty of 10% of the total
transfer price.  

Upon
the completion of this transaction, the Company relinquished ownership of the Airport International Automall property and its
40% ownership of Car King Tianjin.  

Zhonghe
operated in two segments, Sales of Automobiles and Airport Automall Automotive Services. As a result of the sale of Zhonghe, the
airport automall automotive services unit has been discontinued. The disposal of Zhonghe and its Sales of Automobiles division
is not considered a strategic shift on the Company s Sales of Automobiles as such disposal does not impact any of the geographic
coverage, line of business or any other divisions or operations of the Company. Therefore the Company concluded that the disposal
of Zhonghe s Sales of Automobiles division should not be classified as discontinued operations.

The
Airport Automall Automotive Services unit was comprised of two sectors including (1) the rental of the airport automall and (2)
the joint venture investment in Car King Used Cars. Huitong obtained control of Zhonghe on June 1, 2016. After the completion
of the disposal, the Company is no longer involved with the rental or used car business and has no continuing cash inflows or
outflows from this unit. The disposal of the Airport Automall Automotive Services unit has a material impact on the Company s
cash flow and operating results. Therefore the Company concluded that the disposal of the Airport Auto Mall Automotive Services
unit should be classified as discontinued operations.

income (loss) from discontinued operations presented in the condensed statements of operations consists of the following for the

       Retained
    earnings - PRC     

According
to the Law of the PRC on Enterprises with Wholly-Owned Foreign Investment, the Company s subsidiaries in the PRC are required
to make appropriations from after-tax profits as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the PRC (  PRC
GAAP  ) to nondistributable reserves. These reserve funds include one or more of the following: (i) a general reserve,
(ii) an enterprise expansion reserve and (iii) a staff bonus and welfare fund. A wholly-owned PRC subsidiary is not required to
make appropriations to the enterprise expansion reserve but annual appropriations to the general reserve are required to be made
at 10% of the profit after tax as determined under PRC GAAP at each year-end, until such fund has reached 50% of its respective
registered capital. The staff welfare and bonus reserve is determined by the board of directors. The general reserve is used to
offset future losses. The subsidiary may, upon a resolution passed by the stockholder, convert the general reserve into capital.
The staff welfare and bonus reserve are used for the collective welfare of the employees of the subsidiary. The enterprise expansion
reserve is for the expansion of the subsidiary operations and can be converted to capital subject to approval by the relevant
authorities. These reserves represent appropriations of the retained earnings determined in accordance with Chinese law.  

In
addition to the general reserve, the Company s PRC subsidiaries are required to obtain approval from the local PRC government
prior to distributing any registered share capital. Accordingly, both the appropriations to general reserve and the registered
share capital of the Company s PRC subsidiary are considered as restricted net assets and are not distributable as cash
dividends. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s statutory reserve fund was approximately $2,638,000
and $2,126,000, respectively.

professional fees on the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In January
2015, the Company received notification from an individual who claimed to be the owner of St. George International Limited
( St. George ) and made a claim that the debt owed to Sino Peace by the Company had been transferred to St.
George.  However, the Company neither received any evidence to support such assignment nor any notification
from the owner of Sino Peace that Sino Peace was transferring its legal right of collecting the receivable from the Company to
St. George. The Company has been unable to locate the owner of Sino Peace to confirm such transfer and therefore considers such
claim by St. George legally nonbinding at this time .    

The
balances as discussed above as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are interest-free, unsecured and have no fixed term

Forward
Looking Statements   

This
periodic report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 with respect to the financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies,
competitive positions, growth opportunities for existing products, plans and objectives of management. Statements in this periodic
report that are not historical facts are hereby identified as  forward-looking statements  for the purpose of the
safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Generally, the words  believes, 
 anticipates,   may,   will,   should,   expect,   intend, 
 estimate,   continue  and similar expressions or the negative thereof or comparable terminology are intended
to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including the matters
set forth in this report or other reports or documents we file with the SEC from time to time, which could cause actual results
or outcomes to differ materially from those projected.  

Prospective
shareholders should understand that several factors govern whether any forward-looking statements contained herein will be or
can be achieved. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein. These forward-looking
statements include plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans and objectives relating to the products
and the future economic performance of the Company. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among
other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, future business decisions, and the time and money required to
successfully complete development projects, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are
beyond the control of the Company. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained
herein are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results
contemplated in any of the forward-looking statements contained herein will be realized. Based on actual experience and business
development, the Company may alter its marketing, capital expenditure plans or other budgets, which may in turn affect the Company s
results of operations. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the
inclusion of any such statement should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives
or plans of the Company will be achieved. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.  

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with
our condensed consolidated financial statements and their related notes included in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report
on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2015.

BUSINESS
OVERVIEW   

Prior
Operations of China Auto Logistics Inc.   

China
Auto Logistics Inc., formerly Fresh Ideas Media, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 22, 2005. Fresh Ideas
Media, Inc. was engaged in the advertising and consulting business. In February 2005, Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. formed its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Community Alliance, Inc. (  Community Alliance  ), an entity which marketed sub-licenses for take
home school folders. Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. had only commenced limited operations and had not yet generated significant revenues,
and was therefore considered a development stage company.  

The
Exchange and the Spin-Off    

On
November 10, 2008, Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. entered into the Exchange Agreement with HKCo, whereby Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. acquired
all of the issued and outstanding securities of HKCo in exchange for the issuance by Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. of 1,950,000 (pre
reverse split of 11,700,000) newly-issued shares of our common stock. The Closing occurred on the same day, immediately following
the cancellation of an aggregate of 189,167 (pre reverse split of 1,135,000) shares of Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. s common
stock held by Phillip E. Ray and Ruth Daily, Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. s principal stockholders immediately prior to the Closing.
Prior to the Exchange, Phillip E. Ray and Ruth Daily owned approximately 23.89% and 16.58% of the issued and outstanding common
stock of Fresh Ideas Media, Inc., respectively. As of the Closing, HKCo beneficially owned approximately 64.64% of the voting
capital stock of Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. As a result of the Exchange, HKCo became a wholly owned subsidiary of Fresh Ideas Media,
Inc. and Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. s primary business operations were those of HKCo. Shortly after the Closing, Fresh Ideas
Media, Inc. changed its name from Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. to China Auto Logistics Inc.  

In
connection with the consummation of the Exchange, Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. agreed to consummate the spin-off of Community Alliance
through a dividend of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Community Alliance to holders of Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. s
common stock as of September 9, 2008. The spin-off was approved by the Board of Directors of Fresh Ideas Media, Inc. on September
9, 2008 and was to be consummated upon the satisfactory resolution of all of the SEC s comments to the Form 10 registration
statement relating to Community Alliance s common stock and such registration statement s effectiveness. Upon the
consummation of the spin-off, the business and operations of HKCo were the sole business and operations of Fresh Ideas Media,
Inc.  

HKCo
was incorporated in Hong Kong on October 17, 2007. Prior to December 25, 2007, HKCo had minimal assets and no operations. On December
25, 2007, Shisheng a company established under the laws of the People s Republic of China, became a wholly-owned foreign
enterprise of HKCo and this arrangement was approved by relevant ministries of the PRC government.  

Upon
the completion of the transactions on December 25, 2007 and November 10, 2008, the Company owned 100% of HKCo which owned 100%
of Shisheng, the operating entity of HKCo. For financial reporting purposes, these transactions are classified as a recapitalization
of Shisheng and the historical financial statements of Shisheng are reported as the Company s historical financial statements.  

On
November 1, 2010, Shisheng acquired all issued and outstanding stocks of Qizhong and completed the acquisition simultaneously.
As a result, Qizhong became a wholly-owned subsidiary group of the Company and was included in the Company s consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition.  

On
March 15, 2011, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the former owners of Qizhong and agreed that the remaining
cash consideration totaling $2.09 million and the consideration share of 177,238 (pre reverse split of 1,063,427) shares of common
stock of the Company should be paid to the former owners of Qizhong no later than June 30, 2011.  

20  

Pursuant
to the Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding, the purchase price, net of cash acquired of $1.68 million from Qizhong,
was $4.47 million for the acquisition of 100% of Qizhong s equity interests. The purchase price of $4.47 million consisted
of $1.01 million in cash ($2.69 million payable in cash less cash acquired of $1.68 million from Qizhong) and the issuance of
177,238 (pre reverse split of 1,063,427) shares of common stock valued at approximately $3.46 million. The value of common stock
was determined based on $19.50 (pre reverse split of $3.25) per share, the per share price of the Company s common stock
on the acquisition date. The Company remitted approximately $600,000 and the remaining balance of the cash consideration in fiscal
years 2010 and 2011, respectively. The 177,238 (pre reverse split of 1,063,427) shares of the Company s common stock was
to be unconditionally issued and was included in the Company s equity as of December 31, 2010; the Company issued these
shares during fiscal year 2011.  

On
November 22, 2013, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Zhonghe, entered into a Cooperation Framework Agreement with
Car King China, with respect to the establishment of a joint venture that will own and operate a used car business. The establishment
of this joint venture was contingent upon the successful completion by the Company of the acquisition of Zhonghe which owns and
operates the Airport International Auto Mall, where the used car business will be operated. Following the Zhonghe Acquisition,
on November 30, 2013, Tianjin Car King Used Car Trading Company Ltd (the   Joint Venture  ) was established in
accordance with the terms of the Cooperation Framework Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Articles of Association of Car
King Tianjin, the Company will contribute approximately $1,303,000 (RMB8,000,000) and Car King China will contribute approximately
$1,955,000 (RMB12,000,000) to form Car King Tianjin, which will have total registered capital of approximately $3,258,000 (RMB20,000,000).
Prior to being acquired by the Company, Zhonghe contributed approximately $652,000 (RMB4,000,000) in November 2013. The Company
is entitled to 40% of Car King Tianjin s net profit or loss.  

On
November 30, 2013, Shisheng signed the Auto Mall Acquisition Agreement with Hezhong (Tianjin) International Development Ltd. Co.
(  Hezhong  ) to purchase 100% of the equity of Zhonghe, which owns and operates the Airport International Auto
Mall. Under the terms of the Auto Mall Acquisition Agreement, Shisheng will pay RMB559,768,000 (approximately $91.4 million) to
Hezhong, in four annual installments with an annualized rate of interest of 6%. The initial payment of RMB240,000,000 (approximately
$39.2 million) was paid within 5 business days after the signing of the Agreement. Upon the payment by Shisheng of this first
installment, Hezhong transferred control of Zhonghe to Shisheng. Failure by Shisheng to pay the remaining installments may result
in the termination of the Auto Mall Acquisition Agreement, as well as a penalty of 10% of the total transfer price. We made an
installment payment of approximately $16.3 million in November 2014 and $3.2 million in January 2015. On November 10, 2015, the
Company entered into a Payment Extension Agreement with Hezhong to extend the due date for the second $18.6 million installment
payment from November 30, 2015 to May 31, 2016. The final installment payment remains to be due on November 30, 2016. The unpaid
amount bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum. As of December 31, 2015, unpaid installment payments including interest totaled
approximately $36.7 million.  

On
September 23, 2015, the Company sold its 98% equity interest in Zhengji, which was engaged in automobile sales, to Mr. Wu Xiang
Yang, an unrelated party, at a price of $3,048,483 (net of cash of $7,408 at Zhengji and amount due to Zhengji of $5,231,941).
Zhengji s assets consisted of automobile inventories of $3,422,658, other assets of $12,493 and other current liabilities
of $2,329 on the disposal date resulting in a loss on sale of equity interest in subsidiary in the amount of $210,895 after consideration
of the non controlling interest of $173,444 in Zhengji. Zhengji had no material operations during 2015 through the disposal date.  

On
June 1, 2016, Shisheng entered into (i) an Equity Transfer Agreement ( Equity Transfer Agreement ) with Wuxi Huitong
Automobile Sales and Service Co., Ltd. ( Huitong ) to sell 100% of the equity of Zhonghe, and (ii) a Debt Transfer
Agreement, by and among Shisheng, Huitong, and Hezhong (the  Debt Transfer Agreement ). At the time, Zhonghe was the
owner and operator of the Airport International Automall located in the Tianjin Airport Economic Area and the 40%owner of Car
King Tianjin.  

21  

Under
the terms of the Zhonghe Equity Transfer Agreement, the sale price for the Zhonghe equity was approximately $62.8 million (RMB
410,000,000). The sale price was payable in two parts: (i) Huitong will paid Shisheng approximately $26 million (RMB 169,938,192)
in cash and (ii) under the terms of the Debt Transfer Agreement, Huitong assumed Shisheng s outstanding payment obligations
to Hezhong of $36.8 million (RMB 240,061,808) under the Equity Transfer Agreement, dated November 30, 2013, by and between Hezhong
and Shisheng. Upon signing, Shisheng transferred control of Zhonghe to Huitong. Failure by either party to fulfill their obligations
under the Debt Transfer Agreement may result in the termination of the Equity Transfer Agreement, as well as a penalty of 10%
of the total transfer price.  

Upon
the completion of this transaction, the Company relinquished ownership of the Airport International Automall property and its
40% ownership of Car King Tianjin.  

Current
Business of the Company    

The
Company provides individual and business customers with services in relation to automobile sales, financing services, custom clearance,
storage, national transportation, quotation platform, and information relating to automotive services and products, through its
websites (www.at188.com, www.at160.com). The Company also sells imported automobiles and, as the only one-stop service provider
in Tianjin, provides dealer financing to our customers.  

Critical
Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions    

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial
statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States ( US GAAP ), which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of our assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses; to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the condensed
consolidated financial statements; and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial
reporting period. The most significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation of accounts receivable, and the useful
lives and impairment of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, the valuation of deferred tax assets and inventories
and the provision for income taxes. We continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. We rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting
process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment
than others in their application. We believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in this Form 10-Q reflect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe there have been no
material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.  

The
following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements:  

Revenue
Recognition    

We
recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred upon shipment or services have been
rendered, the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.  

The
Company recognizes the sales of automobiles upon delivery and acceptance by the customers and where collectibility is reasonably
assured.  

22  

Service
revenue related to financing services is recognized ratably over the financing period.  

Service
fees for graphical advertisements on the Company s websites are charged on a fixed fee basis. The Company recognizes the
advertising revenue when the service is performed over the service term. The Company charges a monthly fee for listing services
and recognizes the revenue when services are performed. The Company offers sales incentives to its customers in the form of (i)
subscription exemptions, (ii) discounted prices, and (iii) free advertisements. The Company classifies sales incentives as a reduction
of net revenues. Revenues, net of discounts and allowances, are recognized ratably over the service periods.  

The
Company recognizes revenue from automobile value-added services when such services are performed.  

Receivables
Related to Financing Services    

We
record a receivable related to financing services when cash is loaned to customers to finance their purchases of automobiles.
Upon repayments by customers, we record the amounts as reductions of receivables related to financing services. Receivables related
to financing services represent the aggregate outstanding balance of loans from customers related to their purchases of automobiles
and are considered receivables held for investment. We charge a fee for providing loan services and such fee is prepaid by customers.
We amortize these fees over the receivable terms, which range between three months and six months, using the straight-line method.
We record such amortized amounts as financing fee income, and the unamortized amount is classified as deferred revenue on the
Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

We
evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables at the end of each of the reporting periods and make estimates for potential
credit losses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced difficulties in collecting the receivable from a financing
service customer, but the receivable was secured by certain imported automobiles. We took possession of these secured automobiles
and sold them during the year ended December 31, 2015. The sales proceeds were used to offset the outstanding receivable from
this customer. The Company will continue to pursue collecting the remaining receivable balance. As of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, the Company recorded an allowance for uncollectible account on receivable related to financing services in the amount
of $2,931,307 and $3,081,331, respectively.  

Inventories

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost (using the specific identification method) or market (net realizable). We continually evaluate
the composition of our inventory, assessing slow-moving and ongoing products. Our products are comprised of the purchase cost
of automobiles, which declines in value over time. We continuously evaluate our inventory to determine the reserve amount for
slow-moving inventory. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there was no reserve for obsolescence.  

Income
Taxes    

In
the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions
in which we operate. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities.  

23  

We
account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income tax purposes.
Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards
and credits by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. We conduct this analysis on a quarterly basis. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the deferred tax
liabilities amounted to $0 and $9,495,559, respectively.  

The
Company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to its international subsidiaries as they are to be
reinvested indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and are approximately $20.3 million as of September 30, 2016.
Because of the availability of US foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the US income tax liability that would
be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested.  

The
Company has no material uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016 or unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods. The Company classifies interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax
expense. As of September 30, 2016, there are no penalties or interest related to uncertain tax positions. The Company does not
anticipate any significant increases or decreases to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.  

New
Accounting Standards    

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides a single comprehensive
model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue
recognition guidance.  The standard is effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December
15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted as of one year prior to the current effective date. The guidance permits two implementation
approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective
application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
impact of adoption on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern, Disclosures of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting
entities must disclose going concern uncertainties in their financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform
interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of
the entity's financial statements. Additionally, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is substantial doubt about
the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The new standard will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating
the impact of adoption on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .
Under ASU 2015-17, a reporting entity is required to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. Current guidance requiring the offsetting of deferred tax assets and liabilities of a tax-paying
component of an entity and presentation as a single noncurrent amount is not affected. The standard is effective for public entities
for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted
for financial statements as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Entities may apply the update prospectively
to all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively for all periods presented. The effects of this update on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows are not expected to be material.  

24  

The
FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that
arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments
(the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases
with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not
to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases
at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Public business entities should apply
the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal
years (i.e., January 1, 2019, for a calendar year entity). Early application is permitted for all public business entities and
all nonpublic business entities upon issuance. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard
on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) . ASU No. 2016-09 simplifies several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments in this
standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption is permitted. The effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are
not expected to be material.  

The
Company is not aware of any recently issued accounting pronouncements that, when adopted, will have a material effect on the Company s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

The
following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position
and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as
information relating to the plans of our current management and. The following should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements and their related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Results
of Continuing Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

The
following table sets forth certain information relating to our results of operations, and our condensed consolidated statements
of operations for our continuing operations as a percentage of net revenue, for the periods indicated:  

25  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net revenue decreased 35.88% to $96,293,622 from $150,170,888 for the same period
in 2015, and our cost of revenue decreased 35.85% to $95,671,721 from $149,129,426 for the same period in 2015. As compared to
the same period in 2015, our gross profit, income from continuing operations, net loss from continuing operations and net loss
from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of China Auto Logistics Inc. for the three months ended September 30,
2016 decreased 40.28% to $621,901, decreased 104.19% to a loss of $(19,134), decreased 43.52% to $(200,035), and decreased 43.51%
to $(200,000), respectively, due primarily to a decrease in the sales of automobiles  gross margin, the decrease in fee
income from financing services and increases in general and administrative expense which was partially offset by a decrease in
interest expense.  

Net
Revenue   

The
following table sets forth a summary of our net revenue by continuing segment for the periods indicated, in dollars and as a percentage
of total net revenue:  

Sales
of Automobiles    

Net
revenue from Sales of Automobiles decreased 35.9% to $95,261,933 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $148,614,443
for the same period in 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company sold 902 automobiles and 1,418
automobiles, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately 36% in volume. The average unit selling price per automobile
increased to $106,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $105,000 for the same period in 2015. Our gross margin
dropped to 0.14% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.29% during the same period in 2015. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred losses on sales of certain high end automobiles which negatively impacted our
overall gross profit percentage. Our sales increased rapidly during the second half of 2015 and this trend continued during the
first quarter of 2016. While our sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 remained fairly strong, our year over year
numbers were substantially lower because of the exceptional results during the same period of 2015. During the three months ended
September 30, 2015, we believe the strong demands for our automobiles occurred because our customers anticipated increased prices
and therefore increased their orders.  

26  

In
early August 2015, China s official currency Renmenbi ( RMB ) devalued by over 3% against the U.S. dollar over
a 5-day period. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the RMB devaluated over 5.5% against the U.S. dollar. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, RMB declined about 4.6% against the U.S. dollar. Many observers and economists expect the RMB s
devaluation pace to be substantially slower in the coming months, but further downward pressure on the currency remains in the
short term. The Company started to see automobile sales decline substantially in the second quarter of 2016 after strong sales
in the first quarter of 2016. In conjunction with the belief that the RMB s devaluation pace will slow, we expect automobile
sales will stabilize in the remainder of 2016. We nevertheless believe upward movement in overall market demand is possible and,
given implementation of the new  Parallel Imported Vehicles  scheme, a re-allocation of the market share between China s
traditional  4S  authorized dealers and auto resellers like us. These possibilities may result from such things as changes
in consumer preference with respect to luxury automobiles and the frequency with which consumers purchase them. The extent to
which these changes may impact our business cannot be reasonably determined at this time.  

In
August 2014, the China Commerce and Industry Bureau authorized the  Parallel Imported Vehicles  scheme. The  Parallel
Imported Vehicles  scheme permits foreign made automobiles to be imported by importers in addition to authorized automobile
dealers. This policy officially opened the imported automobile market to importers like us, so that we can now be in direct competition
with the authorized dealers. This is an antitrust effort by the Chinese government to address complaints about the authorized
automobile dealers overcharging for foreign-made automobiles. These new rules will also officially allow imported automobiles
sold by parties other than authorized dealers to be treated the same as those sold through authorized dealers (i.e., with respect
to insurance coverage and the registration process). As of September 30, 2016, the PRC government has selected Guangzhou, Shanghai,
Shenzhen and Tianjin as four experimental cities to implement the  Parallel Imported Vehicles  scheme.  

While
we remain one of the leaders in the imported automobile market, we continue to sell our automobiles at a low gross margin in the
very competitive market in order to maintain or expand our market share and maintain our market leader status. During the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, sales for our top three selling brands, Land Rover, Mercedes Benz and Toyota accounted
for 77% and 74%, respectively, of total sales.  

Sales
to the Company s top three customers, each of which are car dealers, accounted for 44% and 46% of the Company s sales
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company will continue to maintain close working relationships
with its top customers while attempting to reduce the concentration of revenues among these top customers by actively looking
for new customers to enlarge its customer base.   

Financing
Services    

The
Company provides Financing Services to its customers using the Company s bank facility lines of credit. The Company earns
a service fee from its customers for drawing its facility lines of credit related to its customers  purchases of automobiles
and payment of import taxes. Customers bear all the interest and fees charged by the banks and prepay those fees upon the execution
of their service contracts with the Company.  

27  

Net
revenue from Financing Services decreased 33.28% to $1,028,259 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,541,186 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company had an aggregate amount of credit lines of approximately $130 million (RMB870
million) as of September 30, 2016 and $170 million (RMB1.08 billion) as of September 30, 2015. Our Financing Services income and
related cost of revenue are affected by the interest rate charged by banks. Our Financing Services revenue consists of two portions:
interest income and fee income. Excluding revenue from the interest income portion of $539,650 and $946,254 in the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the revenue from the fee income portion of our Financing Services decreased 17.87%
to $488,609 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $594,932 for three months ended September 30, 2015. The gross margin
for our Financing Services segment increased to 47.52% for the months ended September 30, 2016 from 38.6% for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower interest expense incurred during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  

Historically,
a significant portion of our financing income has been related to fees that we charge to our customers for extending temporary
credit beyond the financing terms for which these customers have contracted with banks. In the beginning of 2014, we had limited
funds available for this financing service because our available cash was not as sufficient due to significant losses incurred
during the past two years which were primarily attributable to the operations of Zhonghe and Car King Tianjin. On June 1, 2016,
the Company sold 100% equity interest in Zhonghe. After the sale of Zhonghe, our working capital significantly improved. However
we have been experiencing increased competitions in the financing service industry as there are more competitors offering similar
products as we do in the market. We expect growth potential be limited in the financial services. As a result, we have been allocating
more of our working capital to the Sales of Automobiles segment in an effort to continue increasing the sales volume and maintaining
our leadership position. We will seek to continue better managing the use of our cash flow in order to generate additional fee
income in the future.  

We
provide Financing Services to our customers with our lines of credit with major commercial banks in the PRC, including Agricultural
Bank of China, Pudong Development Bank, China Zheshang Bank, and Shengjing Bank. We continue to strengthen our relationship with
these banks and aim to negotiate with more banks for higher lines of credit at more favorable terms. Based on the Company s
business relationships with some financial institutions, we are able to obtain financing on an  as-needed  basis and
we are in negotiations for a number of new credit lines. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had approximately $83 million and
$104 million, respectively, lines of credit available to use in our Financing Services. As of November 11, 2016, the Company had
aggregate credit lines of approximately $130 million (RMB 870 million). Although all of our lines of credit have maturities of
less than one year and may not be renewed on the same terms, if at all, we do not expect that the expiration of our lines of credit
with any one of our existing banks will have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide Financing Services. However,
if the automobile market in the PRC, and in particular the market for imported automobiles, slows down in the future, our revenue
from Financing Services would be materially and adversely affected by a decreased number of transactions.  

Our
revenue growth from Financing Services is heavily dependent on overall industry growth and the economic conditions of the market
in the PRC. As discussed above, we have established credit lines with most major commercial banks in the PRC, and although an
enormous decrease or the simultaneous expiration of credit lines or other bank facilities may temporarily reduce our capacity
to provide financing services and affect our purchase power, we have not experienced formidable difficulties in the access of
credit lines and any other bank facilities in the past. Therefore, we do not foresee any difficulty at this time in obtaining
credit lines and loan facilities from our banks. However as banks in China continue to reduce their credit risk and improve the
quality of their outstanding loans, we continue to experience more requirements for obtaining bank lines and loans such as requiring
personal guarantees by our executives and directors, guarantees by our major customers, suppliers, and business partners.  

28  

Other
Services    

Other
services include revenue generated from Web-based Advertising. We have revised our business plan and moved away from Web-based
Advertising Services and Automobile Value Added Services to focus on Automobile Sales and Financing Services and any potential
business opportunities. We expect that the revenue generated from this segment will continue to be low compared to other segments.
Our Web-based Advertising Services revenue decreased 77.49% to $3,430 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $15,239
for the same period of 2015. Revenue from Web-based Advertising Services was generated by subscription fees and advertisements.  

Cost
of Revenue    

Our
cost of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of the cost of automobiles purchased and certain
direct labor for our the Sales of Automobiles and interest expense and line of credit fees related to our Financing Services.
Our cost of revenue decreased 35.85% to $95,671,721 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $149,129,426 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The Sales of automobiles accounted for 98.93% of our total revenue for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to 98.96% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

As
our cost of revenue consists primarily of the purchase price of imported automobiles, we have limited influence on such costs.
The prices of imported automobiles are determined solely by suppliers and are dependent upon the market conditions. We will continue
to work on obtaining more favorable terms and discounts by strengthening our relationship with suppliers and placing more batch
orders.  

Gross
profit decreased 40.28% to $621,901 in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,041,442 in the three months ended September
30, 2015, primarily due to lower gross margin in the sales of automobiles as a result of losses on sales of certain high end automobiles
and a decrease in the fee revenue of the financing service.  

29  

Operating
Expenses    

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses increased 9.54% to $641,035 from $585,182 for the same
period in 2015. This increase was primarily a result of a 22.52% increase in general and administrative expenses to $460,664 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $375,992 for the same period in 2015.  

The
following table sets forth a breakdown of the primary selling and marketing expenses of the Company:  

Payroll
expenses decreased 12.1% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Staff-related costs
decreased 44.71% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the decrease in the overall benefits per employee
compared to the same period in 2015. Advertising and promotion increased 92.17% to $3,582 during the three months ended September
30, 2016 from $1,864 during the same period in 2015 as we incur advertising and promotion expenses from to time in our normal
business operations. Entertainment expenses decreased by 36.88% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the
same period in 2015. Entertainment expenses fluctuate from time to time depending on the needs of our sales department personnel.  

The following
table sets forth a breakdown of the primary general and administrative expenses of the Company:  

30  

Payroll
expenses decreased 12.37% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the decrease in the number of administration
employees to reduce our cost. Staff-related costs increased 111.84% during the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily
due to the increase in the overall benefits. Entertainment increased 264.51% during the three months ended September 30, 2016
as the management incurred more expenses for business meetings compared to the same period of 2015. Entertainment expenses fluctuate
from time to time depending on the needs of our management personnel. Depreciation expenses increased 106.38% primarily due to
the depreciation on leasehold improvements for the additional office space during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the same period of 2015. Rent expense increased 267.26% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same
period in 2015 primarily due to the new lease signed for additional office space in April 2016, which is used to substitute for
the office space previously used at the Airport International Automall. Legal and professional fees increased 35.57% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to more professional services being performed in the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. We expect the amount of professional fees for the year of 2016 to be comparable
to that for the year of 2015.  

Income
(loss) from Continuing Operations    

Income
(loss) from continuing operations decreased 104.19% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to a loss of $(19,134) from
$456,260 in the same period in 2015. The decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the decrease in the
gross margin of the sales of automobiles business and the decrease in the fee income from the financing services. In addition,
we incurred more rent and depreciation expense related to the leasehold improvements for the additional office space.  

Other
Income and Expenses    

Other
income and expenses consist primarily of interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on disposal of property and equipment.  

The
Company s interest income is generated by interest earned through bank deposits. Interest income decreased 81.14% to $18,811
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $99,754 during the same period in 2015 because of a lower average
prevailing interest rate during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Interest
expense was $202,803 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $622,156 during the same period in 2015. The
decrease of $419,353 or 67.4% was primarily due to lower average borrowing rates and lower bank borrowing balances during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. After the disposal of Zhonghe, the Company had lower
working capital requirements to finance the Zhonghe acquisition payments. As a result, the Company incurred less interest expense
due to reduced bank borrowings during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Loss
on sale of equity interest in subsidiary in the amount of approximately $210,000 was incurred related to the sale of 98% interest
in Zhengji on September 23, 2015. The Company sold its equity interest in Zhengji to Mr. Wu Xiang Yang, an unrelated party, at
a price of approximately $3 million (net of cash of approximately $7,000 at Zhengji and amount due to Zhengji of approximately
$5.2 million). Zhengji s assets consisted of automobile inventories of approximately $3.4 million, other assets of approximately
$12,000 and other current liabilities of approximately $2,000 on the disposal date resulting a loss on sale of equity interest
in subsidiary in the amount of approximately $210,000 after consideration of the non controlling interest of approximately $170,000
in Zhengji. Zhengji had no material operations during 2015 through the disposal date.

compared to the same period of 2015. In addition, we were charged a maintenance fee during the nine months ended September 30,
2015 on our line of credit with Agricultural Bank of China in the amount of $163,000, which was not charged during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016.

Other
Services    

Other
services include revenue generated from Web-based Advertising. We have revised our business plan and moved away from Web-based
Advertising Services and Automobile Value Added Services to focus on Automobile Sales and Financing Services and any potential

to work on obtaining more favorable terms and discounts by strengthening our relationship with suppliers and placing more batch
orders.

The
following table sets forth a breakdown of the primary general and administrative expenses of the Company:  

35  

Payroll
expenses decreased 15.63% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the decrease in the number of administration
employees to reduce our cost. Staff-related costs increased 50.27% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily
due to the increase in the overall benefits, compared to the same period in 2015. Entertainment increased 46.41% during the nine

2015. Entertainment expenses fluctuate from time to time depending on the needs of our management personnel. Depreciation expenses
decreased 7.86% primarily due to certain equipment has been fully depreciated during the nine months ended September 30, 2016

related to the additional office space acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Rent expense increased 145.36%
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to the new lease signed for
additional office space in April 2016, which is used to substitute for the office space previously used at the Airport International
Automall. Legal and professional fees increased 4.02% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to a slight increase
in the professional service performed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. We
expect the amount of professional fees for the year of 2016 to be comparable to that for the year of 2015.  

Income
from Continuing Operations    

Income
from continuing operations decreased 49.74% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $311,741 from $616,999 in the same
period in 2015. The decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the decrease in overall gross profit from
the sales of automobiles.  

Other
Income and Expenses    

Other
income and expenses consist primarily of interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on disposal of property and equipment.  

The
Company s interest income is generated by interest earned through bank deposits.  

Interest
income increased 8.94% to $233,274 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $214,122 during the same period
of 2015 primarily due to the increase in average restricted cash balances which earned interest at fixed deposit rates that were
partially offset by the lower average prevailing interest rates.  

Interest
expense was $1,331,835 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,050,389 during the same period in 2015.
The decrease of $718,554 or 35.04% was primarily due to lower average borrowing rates and lower bank borrowing balances since
the disposal of Zhonghe on June 1, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. After the disposal of Zhonghe, the Company had less
working capital requirements to finance the Zhonghe acquisition payments. As a result, we incurred less interest expense due to
reduced bank borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
Company recognized a gain in disposal of property and equipment in the amount of $2,707 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016. During the same period in 2015, we incurred $8,254 loss on disposal of property and equipment.  

Loss
on sale of equity interest in subsidiary in the amount of approximately $210,000 was incurred related to the sale of 98% interest
in Zhengji on September 23, 2015. The Company sold its equity interest in Zhengji to Mr. Wu Xiang Yang, an unrelated party, at
a price of approximately $3 million (net of cash of approximately $7,000 at Zhengji and amount due to Zhengji of approximately
$5.2 million). Zhengji s assets consisted of automobile inventories of approximately $3.4 million, other assets of approximately
$12,000 and other current liabilities of approximately $2,000 on the disposal date resulting a loss on sale of equity interest
in subsidiary in the amount of approximately $210,000 after consideration of the non controlling interest of approximately $170,000
in Zhengji. Zhengji had no material operations during 2015 through the disposal date.  

36  

Inflation

We
believe that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations for the three months and nine month period ended September 30,
2016. However, overall commodity inflation is an ongoing concern for our business and has been a considerable operational and
financial focus for the Company. We continue to monitor commodity costs and work with our suppliers and customers to manage changes
in commodity costs.  

Discontinued
Airport Automall Automotive Services Business Unit    

On
June 1, 2016, the Company discontinued the Airport Automall Automotive Services business unit as a result of the sale of Zhonghe.
In connection with the sale, we recognized a gain of $6,701,350, which was excluded from the operating results of the continuing
results. The operating results of Airport Automall Automotive Services business unit was included in the discontinued operations.
The Company received approximately $21.9 million net cash proceeds (net of the amount owed to Zhonghe and the outstanding payable
to former owner of Hezhong which was assumed by Huitong) from the sale of Zhonghe. The Company expects to use the cash proceeds
from the sale for working capital.  

Excluding
the gain from the disposal of Zhonghe, income (loss) from discontinued operations amounted to $0 and $1,602,916 during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $(1,910,641) and $(2,040,975) during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The loss from discontinued operations was primarily attributable to the depreciation expense
on the airport automall property and interest expense related to the payable related to the Zhonghe acquisition and short term
borrowings to finance the prior acquisition payments.  

Upon
the completion of this transaction, the Company relinquished ownership of the Airport International Automall property and its
40% ownership of Car King Tianjin.  

Please
refer to Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    

We
generally finance our operations through a combination of operating profit, short-term borrowing from banks and shareholder loans.
During the reporting periods, we arranged a number of bank loans to satisfy our financing needs. As of the date of this Form 10-Q,
we have not experienced any difficulty in raising funds through bank loans, and we have not experienced any liquidity problems
in settling our payables in the ordinary course of business and repaying our bank loans when they come due.  

We
believe that the level of financial resources is a significant factor for our future development, and accordingly, we may determine
from time to time to raise capital through private debt or equity financings to strengthen the Company s financial position,
to expand our facilities and to provide the Company with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities. No
assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising such additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company.  

37  

The
following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Going
Concern    

The
Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows and may continue to generate negative cash flows as the
Company implements its business plan for 2016. There can be no assurance that the Company s continuing efforts to execute
its business plan will be successful and that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying interim
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates the Company s
continuation as a going concern. The Company s net loss from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $200,000
and $354,036 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $865,397 and $1,621,949 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated a deficit of $3,421,910 and net cash used in operating activities from continuing
operations of $51,395,675 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.  

On
June 1, 2016, the Company sold 100% of the equity interest in Zhonghe to Huitong for approximately $62.8 million and entered into
an agreement to transfer the outstanding payable balance related to the Zhonghe acquisition of approximately $36.8 million to
Huitong. We received a net cash proceeds of approximately $21.9 million (net of payable to Zhonghe of approximately $4.1 million).
The Company expects to use the cash proceeds from the sale for working capital.  

The
Company does not currently have sufficient cash or commitments for financing to sustain its operations for the next twelve months.
The Company s plan continues to be to develop new customer relationships and substantially increase our cash flows from
operations and revenue derived from our products/services. If the Company s revenues do not reach the level anticipated
in our plan, the Company may require additional financing in order to execute our operating plan. If additional financing is required,
the Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity, debt, or another form, and the Company
may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that
financing sources are not available, or that the Company is unsuccessful in increasing its revenues and profits, the Company may
be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay our debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of
which would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Operating
Activities    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net cash used in operating activities of $52,694,784 (including net cash used
in operating activities of $1,299,109 from discontinued operations) as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $6,424,832
(including net of net cash used in operating activities of $640,931) from discontinued operations) during the same period of 2015.
Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of an increase in restricted
cash of $35,507,788 due to an increase in notes payable to suppliers, which required maintaining certain levels of restricted
cash, and an increase in advances to suppliers of $54,723,792 as we continue to be positive about China s luxury automobile
sales market, which was partially offset by an increase in notes payable to suppliers of $36,344,159.  

38  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of a net loss of $3,664,024,
an increase in restricted cash due to larger balance of restricted cash required for notes payable of $29,328,731, an increase
in advances to suppliers of $42,899,839 due to the building up of our inventory orders in order to increase our inventory selections
for our customers and certain purchase orders being subsequently canceled as a result of our change of assessment in the market
demands. The net amount of cash used in operating activities was partially offset by an increase in notes payable to suppliers
of $36,809,837, and an increase in customer deposits of $13,588,419 due to increased advanced payments from our customers for
future sales.  

Investing
Activities    

We
received net proceeds of $21,750,802 from the sale of Zhonghe during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We received cash
proceeds of $8,563 and $9,275 related to the disposal of an automobile used by the Company during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We paid $342,435 and $2,318 to purchase property and equipment during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Financing
Activities    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $25,675,132 as compared to net cash provided
by financing activities of $2,231,452 during the same period in 2015. The net cash provided by financing activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included mainly net proceeds of $27,308,187 and $2,178,927, respectively, on short-term
loans from banks. Bank overdraft decreased $2,117,974 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $91,222 during the same
period in 2015. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we received non-interest bearing short-term
advances from our Director and Senior Vice President, Ms. Cheng Weihong, in the amount of $484,919 and $599,120, respectively,
and repaid $0 and $455,373, respectively.  

Our
total cash and cash equivalents decreased to $1,390,772 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $6,438,003 as of September 30,
2015.  

Working
Capital    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $24,568,418 compared to working capital deficit of ($30,801,730) as
of December 31, 2015.  

The
Company s cash is used to finance the purchases of inventory, payments for advances from suppliers, and restricted cash
as requirements for our financing services operation, lines of credit related to financing services and short-term borrowings.
As of September 30, 2016, the increase of working capital was primarily attributable to net cash received of approximately $21.9
million and the relief of the payable related to the Zhonghe acquisition of approximately $36.8 million.  

The
Company has aggregate outstanding balance of lines of credit related to financing services of $47,161,036 and $73,004,179 as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and outstanding balances of short-term borrowings of $13,494,508 and $67,290,734
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, we had a bank overdraft with a balance of $0 and $2,131,009
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

39  

We
aim to continue to improve the level of our working capital through increased net profits and cash flow and efficiently controlling
costs. The Company previously adopted measures to lower holding costs of inventories and continues to develop and maintain good
relationships with banks for favorable financing terms.  

Indebtedness   

We
have entered into several banking facilities with Agricultural Bank of China, PuDong Development Bank, China ZheShang Bank, and
Shengjing Bank. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had aggregate credit lines of approximately $130 million
(RMB870 million) and $166 million (RMB1.08 billion), respectively, and had outstanding balances under these credit lines amounted
to approximately $47 million and $73 million, respectively. As of November 11, 2016, the Company had aggregate credit lines of
approximately $130 million (RMB870 million) with its banks.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $13,494,508 and $67,290,734, respectively,
related to certain short-term loan agreements with Agricultural Bank of China and China Zheshang Bank. These loans carried interest
at rates ranging from 4.35% to 5.66% per annum and maturity dates between six months to one year from the original loan agreement
dates. These loans were used for our working capital. We continue to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and our
excellent relationships with the major banks to secure loans at attractive terms. In order to expand our revenues on Sales of
Automobiles, we are required to have a significant amount of working capital since our suppliers require deposits for orders.
As we continue to see growth in our automobile sales business, we expect to continue to use short term loans to finance our business
expansion.  

We
had an overdraft of $0 and $2,131,009 with Pudong Development Bank as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

On
June 1, 2016, the Company sold 100% equity interest in Zhonghe to Huitong for approximately $62.8 million and entered into an
agreement to transfer the outstanding payable balance related to the Zhonghe acquisition of approximately $36.8 million to Huitong.
We received a net cash proceed of approximately $21.9 million (net of payable to Zhonghe of approximately $4.1 million).  

We
believe that the level of financial resources is a significant factor for our future development and accordingly, we may determine
from time to time to raise capital through private debt or equity financings to strengthen the Company s financial position,
to expand our facilities and to provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities. No assurances
can be given that we will be successful in raising such additional capital on terms acceptable to us.  

OFF-BALANCE

Company does not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments, off-balance sheet guarantees or interest rate swap transactions

Item
4. Controls and Procedures  

A.       Material
Weaknesses    

As
discussed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified a material weakness
in the design and operation of our internal controls. The material weakness is: the Company s accounting department personnel
have limited knowledge and experience in US GAAP.  

To
remediate the material weakness identified in internal control over financial reporting of the Company, we have commenced to:
(a) continue our efforts to recruit additional personnel with sufficient knowledge and experience in US GAAP; and (b) continue
our efforts to provide ongoing training courses in US GAAP to existing personnel, including our Chief Financial Officer and the
Financial Controller.  

We
will continue to monitor and assess our remediation initiatives to ensure that the aforementioned material weakness stated is
remediated.  

B.       Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the Company s filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. The Company s management,
with the participation of its principal executive and financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that
evaluation and solely due to the unremediated material weakness described above, the Company s principal executive and financial
officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the purpose for which they were designed
as of the end of such period. As a result of this conclusion, the financial statements for the period covered by this report were
prepared with particular attention to the unremediated material weaknesses previously disclosed. Accordingly, management believes
that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S, notwithstanding the unremediated weaknesses.  

B.       Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that was identified in connection with such evaluation
that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
