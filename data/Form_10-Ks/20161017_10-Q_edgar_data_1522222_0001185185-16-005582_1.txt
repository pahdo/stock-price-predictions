Note 1   Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business 

CLS Holdings USA, Inc. (the  Company ) was originally incorporated as Adelt Design, Inc. ( Adelt ) on March 31, 2011 to manufacture and market carpet binding art. Production and marketing of carpet binding art never commenced.

On November 12, 2014, CLS Labs, Inc. ( CLS Labs ) acquired 10,000,000 shares, or 55.6%, of the outstanding shares of common stock of Adelt from its founder, Larry Adelt. On that date, Jeffrey Binder, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of CLS Labs, was appointed Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On November 20, 2014, Adelt adopted amended and restated articles of incorporation, thereby changing its name to CLS Holdings USA, Inc. Effective December 10, 2014, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-0.625 (the  Reverse Split ), wherein 0.625 shares of the Company s common stock were issued in exchange for each share of common stock issued and outstanding. As a result, 6,250,000 shares of the Company s common stock were issued to CLS Labs in exchange for the 10,000,000 shares that it owned by virtue of the above-referenced purchase from Larry Adelt.

On April 29, 2015, the Company, CLS Labs and CLS Merger Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of CLS Holdings, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) and completed a merger, whereby CLS Merger Inc. merged with and into CLS Labs, with CLS Labs remaining as the surviving entity (the  Merger ). Upon the consummation of the Merger, the shares of the common stock of CLS Holdings owned by CLS Labs were extinguished and the former stockholders of CLS Labs were issued an aggregate of 15,000,000 (post Reverse Split) shares of common stock in CLS Holdings in exchange for their shares of common stock in CLS Labs. As a result of the Merger, the Company acquired the business of CLS Labs and abandoned its previous business.

The Company has a patent pending proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. These concentrates may be ingested in a number of ways, including through vaporization via electronic cigarettes ( e-cigarettes ), and used for a variety of pharmaceutical and other purposes. Internal testing of this extraction method and conversion process has revealed that it produces a cleaner, higher quality product and a significantly higher yield than the cannabinoid extraction processes currently existing in the marketplace. The Company has not commercialized its patent pending proprietary process or otherwise earned any revenues.  The Company plans to generate revenues through licensing, fee-for-service and joint venture arrangements related to its patent pending proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into saleable concentrates.

The Company has adopted a fiscal year end of May 31st.

Basis of Presentation 

These financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and are expressed in US dollars.

Principals of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CLS Holdings USA, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, CLS Labs, Inc. and CLS Labs Colorado, Inc.  All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Table of Contents 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,238 and $88,244 as of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property and equipment is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated net recoverable amount, and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.  Computer equipment is being depreciated over a three-year period.

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company continually monitors its banking relationships and consequently has not experienced any losses in such accounts.

Advertising and Marketing Costs 

Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred no advertising and marketing costs for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. The Company incurred no research and development costs for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to the extent deferred tax assets may not be recoverable after consideration of the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) No. 825 - Financial Instruments, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all financial instruments included on its balance sheets. The carrying amount of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, note receivable, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, none of which is held for trading, approximates their estimated fair values due to the short-term maturities of those financial instruments.

A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 - Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by market data.

Derivative Financial Instruments 

Derivatives are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The conversion features of the convertible notes are embedded derivatives and are separately valued and accounted for on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized during the period of change as a separate component of other income/expense. Fair values for exchange-traded securities and derivatives are based on quoted market prices. The pricing model the Company used for determining fair value of its derivatives is the Lattice Model. Valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review. The model uses market-sourced inputs such as interest rates and stock price volatilities. Selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net income. The derivative component of the convertible notes issued on March 18, 2016 (the  2016 Convertible Notes ) was valued at date of amendment and at period end. The following assumptions were used for the valuation of the derivative liability related to the 2016 Convertible Notes:

- The quoted market price of the common stock, which decreased from $0.88 as of May 31, 2016 to $0.61 as of August 31, 2016, would fluctuate with the Company s projected volatility;

- The original conversion prices of the 2016 Convertible Notes, which are fixed at $1.07 and $0.80, or upon default/fundamental transaction at 52% of the 20 trading day low Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) would remain in effect;

- An event of default at 24% interest rate would occur 0% of the time, increasing 1.00% per month to a maximum of 10%, and in place of a penalty there would be an alternative conversion price;

- The projected volatility curve from an annualized analysis for each valuation period was based on the historical volatility of the Company and the term remaining for each note.  The projected volatility was 93% at August 31, 2016;

- The Company would redeem the notes (with a 130% prepayment penalty) projected initially at 0% of the time and increasing monthly by 1.0% to a maximum of 10.0% (from alternative financing being available for a redemption event to occur); and

- The holder would automatically convert the notes at the maximum of 2 times the conversion price or the stock price if the common stock underlying the 2016 Convertible Notes was eligible for sale in compliance with securities laws (assumed at September 18, 2016) and the Company was not in default.

Revenue Recognition 

For revenue from product sales, the Company recognizes revenue using four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.

The Company has not generated revenue to date.

Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share 

Basic net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, while fully-diluted net earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive securities assumed to be outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities consist of options and warrants to purchase common stock, and convertible debt. Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.

The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of outstanding stock options and warrants. Stock options and warrants for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.

A net loss causes all outstanding stock options and warrants to be antidilutive. As a result, the basic and dilutive losses per common share are the same for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.

Commitments and Contingencies 

Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.  The Company s management assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.  In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims brought to such legal counsel s attention as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company s financial statements.  If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.

Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) are subject to change. Changes in such standards may have an impact on the Company s future financial statements. The following are a summary of recent accounting developments.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), to reduce the complexity of certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. ASU 2016-09 involves changes in several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for the income tax consequences of share-based awards.  For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current on the balance sheet.  ASU 2015-17 is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company has elected early adoption as of the interim period beginning December 1, 2015, effective for the annual period ending May 31, 2016, and has selected the prospective application. Prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted. 

In September 2015, the  FASB  issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , which requires the acquirer in a business combination to recognize in the reporting period in which adjustment amounts are determined, any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-16, an acquirer was required to restate prior period financial statements as of the acquisition date for adjustments to provisional amounts. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

In July 2015, the FASB, issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory     , which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of the ASU at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 2   Going Concern

As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred net losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of $4,740,961 as of August 31, 2016. Further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans and/or the proceeds from the sale of securities. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. 

Note 3   Prepaid Expenses

Prepaid expenses consisted of $6,742 in prepaid legal fees as of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016:

Note 6   Note Receivable

During the year ended May 31, 2015, the Company loaned $500,000 (the  Note ) to Picture Rock Holdings, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( PRH ).  Pursuant to the Note, as amended by the parties effective June 30, 2015, October 31, 2015, April 11, 2016, and May 31, 2016, PRH will repay the principal due under the Note in twenty (20) equal quarterly installments of Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) commencing in the month following the month in which PRH commences generating revenue at the grow facility, which commencement is anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2017, and continuing until paid in full. Interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Note at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and will be paid quarterly in arrears commencing after such initial payment and continuing until paid in full.  All outstanding principal and any accumulated unpaid interest due under the Note is due and payable on the five-year anniversary of the initial payment thereunder.   In the event of default as defined in the agreements relating to the Note, all amounts under the Note shall become at once due and payable.  During the year ended May 31, 2015, the Company recorded an impairment related to the note receivable in the amount of $500,000.  This receivable is recorded on the balance sheet as of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016 in the amount of $0, net of allowance in the amount of $500,000 (see note 10).

Note 9   Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities

The Company had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $492,165 and $431,017 at August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, which consist of legal fees, deferred rent liability and other trade payables.

Beneficial Conversion Features

The 2016 Convertible Notes contain conversion features that create derivative liabilities. The pricing model the Company used for determining fair value of its derivatives is the Lattice Model. Valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review. The model uses market-sourced inputs such as interest rates and stock price volatilities. Selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net income.  The derivative component of the convertible notes issued on March 18, 2016, April 22, 2016 and May 27, 2016 (collectively, the  2016 Convertible Notes ) was valued at the date of the amendment to the 2016 Convertible Notes and at period end. The following assumptions were used for the valuation of the derivative liability related to the 2016 Convertible Notes:

- The quoted market price of the common stock, which decreased from $0.88 as of May 31, 2016 to $0.61 as of August 31, 2016, would fluctuate with the Company s projected volatility;

- The original conversion prices of the 2016 Convertible Notes, which are fixed at $1.07 and $0.80, or upon default/fundamental transaction at 52% of the 20 trading day low Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) would remain in effect;

- An event of default at 24% interest rate would occur 0% of the time, increasing 1.00% per month to a maximum of 10%, and in place of a penalty there would be an alternative conversion price;

- The projected volatility curve from an annualized analysis for each valuation period was based on the historical volatility of the Company and the term remaining for each note.  The projected volatility was 93% at August 31, 2016;

- The Company would redeem the notes (with a 130% prepayment penalty) projected initially at 0% of the time and increasing monthly by 1.0% to a maximum of 10.0% (from alternative financing being available for a redemption event to occur); and

- The holder would automatically convert the notes at the maximum of 2 times the conversion price or the stock price if the common stock underlying the 2016 Convertible Notes was eligible for sale in compliance with securities laws (assumed at September 18, 2016) and the Company was not in default.

Note 12   Stockholders  Equity

The Company s authorized capital stock consists of 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.

As a result of the reverse stock split, 11,250,000 shares (post Reverse-Split) of common stock were outstanding as of December 10, 2014.

On October 9, 2015, the Company extended the consulting agreement and agreed to issue the consultant an additional 10,000 shares of common stock, valued at $11,700.  On December 15, 2015, the Company extended the consulting agreement and agreed to issue the consultant an additional 10,000 shares of common stock, valued at $8,000.  All shares were valued based on the closing market price on the grant date.  During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company issued 40,000 shares to this consultant, valued at $32,750.   

As of August 31, 2016, the Company had 70,000 shares of common stock payable valued at $65,700 due to two third party consultants included in stock payable on the accompanying balance sheets.  The parties are in discussions regarding whether any shares of the Company s common stock have been earned and it is uncertain whether any shares will be issued.

Note 13   Fair Value of Financial Instruments

In March 2016, the Company entered into convertible note agreements containing beneficial conversion features with Old Main.  One of the features is a ratchet reset provision which, in general, reduces the conversion price should the Company issue equity with an effective price per share that is lower than the stated conversion price in the note agreement (see note 11). The Company accounts for the fair value of the conversion feature in accordance with ASC 815- Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging and Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) 07-05- Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity s Own Stock ( EITF 07-05 ). The Company carries the embedded derivative on its balance sheet at fair value and accounts for any unrealized change in fair value as a component of its results of operations.

The following summarizes the Company s derivative financial liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis at August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016.

The estimated fair values of the Company s derivative liabilities are as follows:

Note 14   Commitment and Contingencies

The Company, through CLS Labs Colorado, leases 42,392 square feet of warehouse and office space (the  Leased Space ) in a building located on 1.92 acres in Denver Colorado. CLS Labs Colorado subleases the Leased Space to Picture Rock Holdings, LLC as part of an arrangement whereby Picture Rock Holdings, LLC and its affiliate will conduct certain intended activities, including growing, extraction, conversion, assembly and packaging of cannabis and other plant materials, as permitted by and in compliance with state, city and local laws, rules, ordinances and regulations.  Total expense for the lease was $44,883 and $44,461 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.

Employment Agreements

CLS Labs and Jeffrey Binder entered into a five-year employment agreement effective October 1, 2014. Under the agreement, Mr. Binder serves as CLS Labs  Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and is entitled to receive an annual salary of $150,000. Under the agreement, Mr. Binder is also entitled to receive a performance bonus equal to 2% of CLS Labs  annual EBITDA, up to a maximum annual cash compensation of $1 million (including his base salary), and annual stock options, exercisable at the fair market value of CLS Labs  common stock on the date of grant, in an amount equal to 2% of its annual EBITDA up to $42.5 million and 4% of its annual EBITDA in excess of $42.5 million.  On April 28, 2015, CLS Labs and the Company entered into an addendum to Mr. Binder s employment agreement whereby Mr. Binder agreed that following the merger of CLS Labs and a subsidiary of the Company, in addition to his obligations to CLS Labs, he would serve the Company and its subsidiaries in such roles as the Company may request.  In exchange, the Company agreed to assume the obligations of CLS Labs to grant Mr. Binder annual stock options, as referenced above.  Mr. Binder continues to receive an annual salary of $150,000 from CLS Labs for servicing as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  My Binder deferred all of the salary payable to him under his employment agreement through May 31, 2016.  On July 20, 2016, the Company issued Mr. Binder a convertible note in exchange for $250,000 in deferred salary, among other amounts owed to Mr. Binder by the Company.  As of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, the Company had accrued compensation due to Mr. Binder in the amount of $37,500 and $250,000.

Effective August 1, 2015, the Company and Alan Bonsett entered into a five-year employment agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Bonsett commenced serving as the Company s Chief Operating Officer on August 15, 2015. Under the agreement, Mr. Bonsett is entitled to receive an annual salary of $150,000. Further, he is entitled to receive a performance bonus equal to 2% of the Company s annual EBITDA, up to a maximum annual cash compensation of $1 million (including his base salary), and annual stock options, exercisable at the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, in an amount equal to 2% of its annual EBITDA up to $42.5 million and 4% of its annual EBITDA in excess of $42.5 million. Additionally, Mr. Bonsett received a one-time signing bonus of 250,000 (post Reverse-Split) shares of restricted common stock of the Company, valued at $327,500, which became fully vested one year from the effective date of the agreement. Mr. Bonsett, as an owner of PRH, will indirectly receive the benefits of the Colorado Arrangement, as discussed in Note 10. Because construction of the grow facility was only completed in December 2016, the business to be operated by PRH pursuant to the Colorado Arrangement has not yet produced revenues.

At August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, the Company had accrued salary due to Michael Abrams, a former officer of the Company, prior to his September 1, 2015 termination, in the amount of $16,250 in accrued compensation on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Note 15   Subsequent Events

On October 6, 2016, we entered into an Amendment to Agreements ( Amendment to Agreements ) with Old Main Capital which:

1. Amended the Securities Purchase Agreement by, among other things, (i) deleting the Company s obligation to register the Company s common stock underlying the 10% Notes and the 8% Note and (ii) reducing the aggregate amount of the 10% Notes to be issued thereunder from $555,555 to $333,333, which have already been issued;

3. Amended the 8% Note by (i) amending, effective September 1, 2016, the amortization schedule attached to the 8% Note to commence at the earlier of (a) one hundred and twenty calendar days from the date of the Amendment to Agreements or (b) the effectiveness of the registration statement filed with respect to the Equity Purchase Agreement and (ii) prohibiting Old Main from delivering a Notice of Conversion (as defined in the 8% Note) to the Company at any time after a Put Notice (as defined in the Equity Purchase Agreement (as described below)) has been received by Old Main from the Company and before the first trading day immediately following the closing associated with such Put Notice; and

On October 6, 2016, we also entered into an Amendment to Equity Purchase Agreement ( Amendment to Equity Line ) with Old Main, which amended the Equity Purchase Agreement by (i) amending the Commitment Period (as defined in the Equity Purchase Agreement) so that it shall be 24 months from the date of execution of the Amendment to Equity Line, (ii) prohibiting the Company from delivering a subsequent Put Notice (as defined in the Equity Purchase Agreement) from the beginning of any Valuation Period (as defined in the  Equity  Purchase Agreement) until the fourth Trading Day (as defined in the  Equity  Purchase Agreement) immediately following the closing associated with the prior Put Notice, (iii) amending the beneficial  ownership  limitation in Section 7.2(g) of the Equity Purchase Agreement to increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined in the Equity Purchase Agreement) to 9.99% and to remove the ability of Old Main to increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and (iv) replacing the schedules to the Equity Purchase Agreement with the schedules attached to the Amendment to Equity Line reflecting recent developments since the date the Equity Purchase Agreement was executed.

We evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued. We did not identify any additional material events or transactions occurring during this subsequent event reporting period that required further recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

We were incorporated on March 31, 2011 as Adelt Design, Inc. to manufacture and market carpet binding art. Production and marketing of carpet binding art never commenced.  On November 20, 2014, we adopted amended and restated articles of incorporation, thereby changing our name to CLS Holdings USA, Inc. Effective December 10, 2014, we effected a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-0.625 (the  Reverse Split ), wherein 0.625 shares of our common stock were issued in exchange for each share of common stock issued and outstanding.

On April 29, 2015, the Company, CLS Labs and the Merger Sub consummated the merger, whereby the Merger Sub merged with and into CLS Labs, with CLS Labs remaining as the surviving entity. As a result of the merger, we acquired the business of CLS Labs and abandoned our previous business. As such, only the financial statements of CLS Labs are included in this annual report.

CLS Labs was originally incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 1, 2014 under the name RJF Labs, Inc. before changing its name to CLS Labs, Inc. on October 24, 2014. It was formed to commercialize a proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. These concentrates may be ingested in a number of ways, including through vaporization via electronic cigarettes ( e-cigarettes ), and used for a variety of pharmaceutical and other purposes. Testing in conjunction with two Colorado growers of this extraction method and conversion process has revealed that it produces a cleaner, higher quality product and a significantly higher yield than the cannabinoid extraction processes currently existing in the marketplace.

On April 17, 2015, CLS Labs took its first step toward commercializing its proprietary methods and processes by entering into the Colorado Arrangement through its wholly owned subsidiary, CLS Labs Colorado, with certain Colorado entities, including PRH. CLS Labs had not otherwise commercialized its proprietary process prior to the merger and has not earned any revenues.

We intend to generate revenue through (i) the licensing of our patent pending proprietary methods and processes to others, as in the Colorado Arrangement, (ii) the processing of cannabis for others, and (iii) the purchase of cannabis and the processing and sale of cannabis-related products.  We plan to accomplish this through the creation of joint ventures, through licensing agreements, and through fee-for-service arrangements with growers and dispensaries of cannabis products. We believe that we can establish a position as one of the premier cannabinoid extraction and processing companies in the industry. Assuming we do so, we then intend to explore the creation of our own brand of concentrates for consumer use, which we would sell wholesale to cannabis dispensaries. We believe that we can create a  gold standard  national brand by standardizing the testing, compliance and labeling of our products in an industry currently comprised of small, local businesses with erratic and unreliable product quality, testing practices and labeling. We also plan to offer consulting services through a consulting subsidiary, CLS Consulting, which will generate revenue by providing consulting services to cannabis-related businesses, including growers, dispensaries and laboratories, and driving business to our processing facilities.

We had a net loss of $615,075 for the three months ended August 31, 2016, resulting in an accumulated deficit as of August 31, 2016 of $4,740,961. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 and 2015

Revenues 

The Company had no revenues during the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses decreased $9,662, or approximately 5%, to $174,745 during the three months ended August 31, 2016, compared to $184,407 for the three month ended August 31, 2015.  General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of general office expenses, travel costs, rent expense, bank charges and payroll expenses.  We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we implement our business plan and commence operations.

Table of Contents 

Professional fees 

Professional fees increased $48,027, or approximately 19%, to $306,181 during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $258,154 for the three months ended August 31, 2015.  This increase was due primarily to the payment of fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. We expect professional fees to increase in future periods as our business grows.

Interest expense 

Interest expense for the three months ended August 31, 2016 was $258,070, an increase of $224,119 compared to $33,951 for the three months ended August 31, 2015.  Interest expense consists of $271 of imputed interest, $34,191 of interest on related party debt, $21,412 of interest on debt and $202,196 of amortization of debt discounts on notes payable.  Interest expense increased primarily due to the increase in the aggregate amount of debt outstanding from $250,000 at August 31, 2015 to $2,728,582 at August 31, 2016 and the increase in debt discounts due to the Company s issuance of convertible debt of $200,000 at August 31, 2015 to $2,723,582 at August 31, 2016

Change in fair value of derivative liability 

We revalued the derivative liability related to our 8% and 10% Notes at August 31, 2016 at $294,616.  This revaluation resulted in a gain of $123,921, which the Company included in results of operations for the three months ended August 31, 2016.

Net loss 

For the reasons above, the Company had a net loss for the three months ended August 31, 2016 of $615,075, which is an increase of $138,563, or approximately 29%, compared to a net loss of $476,512 during the three months ended August 31, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at August 31, 2016 compared to May 31, 2016.

At August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,232,141 and $1,244,458, respectively. This working capital deficit occurred primarily because we have not yet commenced earning revenues.  We anticipate that we will commence earning revenues by the first quarter of 2017.  During the three months ended August 31, 2016, we obtained loans from our officers, directors and an entity affiliated with Frank Koretsky, one of our directors, to cover operating expenses and expenses related to the Merger and the Colorado Arrangement.  This working capital deficit will likely continue to increase until we begin earning revenues but should not be viewed as an indicator of our future performance once we commence earning revenues. We have operated at a loss since inception. 

Cash flows from operations used $378,493 during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $294,907 during the three months ended August 31, 2015.  This increase is primarily due to the amortization of the debt discount associated with our convertible notes, the change in fair value of the derivative liability associated with the Old Main notes, deferred liabilities associated with the Colorado Arrangement and an increase in accounts payable because we were incurring expenses associated with the Colorado Arrangement but had not yet commenced earning revenue.

Cash flows from investing activities used $11,513 during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $2,674 during the three months ended August 31, 2015.  During the three months ended August 31, 2016 the Company had construction in progress on its Colorado facility.  

Cash flows from financing activities provided $305,000 during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $150,000 during the three months ended August 31, 2015.  During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company borrowed funds from its officers, directors and an entity affiliated with one of its directors.

On April 29, 2015, we issued a convertible promissory note (the  April 2015 Note ) to an unaffiliated individual in the amount of $200,000.  Interest accrues on the April 2015 Note at a rate of 15% per annum. On the first anniversary of the April 2015 Note, all then-accrued interest was due thereunder. Thereafter, principal together with accrued interest is due in eight (8) equal quarterly payments, in arrears, commencing on July 1, 2016.  All outstanding principal and any accumulated unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable on the third anniversary of note. At the holder s election, at any time prior to payment or prepayment of the April 2015 Note in full, all principal and accrued interest under the April 2015 Note may be converted in whole, but not in part, into our securities. For each dollar converted, the holder shall receive two shares of common stock and a three-year warrant to purchase 1.33 shares of common stock at $0.75 per share.  As of August 31, 2016 we have not yet made any payments on the April 2015 Note.

On March 18, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Old Main Capital, LLC ( Old Main ), whereby Old Main agreed to purchase an aggregate of up to $500,000 in subscription amount corresponding to an aggregate of up to $555,555 in principal amount of 10% Original Issuance Discount Convertible Promissory Notes (the  10% Notes ) due, subject to the terms therein, in installments as set forth below. The purchase was originally to occur, at our option, in up to five tranches, with the first tranche of $200,000 being purchased on March 18, 2016; t he second tranche of $50,000 being purchased on the first Friday, which is a trading day after  the date (the  Filing Date ) that a registration statement (the  Registration Statement ) registering shares of common stock of the Company issuable upon conversion or repayment of the 10% Notes, is filed with the SEC; the third tranche of $50,000 being purchased  on the first Friday, which is a trading day at least three (3) trading days after the  Company receives initial comments from the SEC on the Registration Statement, or the date that we are notified by the SEC that the Registration Statement will not be reviewed; and the fourth and fifth tranches of $100,000 each being purchased after the date that the Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC (the  SEC Effective Date ) .  On October 6, 2016, we amended the Purchase Agreement and related documents (the  Amendment ) to reduce the aggregate principal amount under the 10% Notes from $555,555 to $333,333, all $300,000 in subscription amount of which has been funded and used by us for general working capital purposes.  We also increased the interest rate of the 10% Notes from 10% to 15% effective August 1, 2016.  Finally, pursuant to the Amendment, we agreed with Old Main that we would not register the resale of the shares underlying the 10% Notes and the 8% Note, as defined below, pursuant to the Registration Statement but would utilize the Registration Statement solely to register the resale of shares of common stock sold by us to Old Main pursuant to the equity line agreement, as described below. 

As a result of the Amendment, effective September 1, 2016, we deferred the commencement of amortization payments on the 10% Notes by 30 days.  As amended, at the earlier of October 18, 2016 or two (2) trading days after the SEC Effective Date, we must begin to redeem 1/24th of the face amount of the 10% Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest on a bi-weekly basis. Such amortization payment may be made, at our option, in cash or, subject to certain conditions, in our common stock pursuant to a conversion rate equal to the lower of (a) $0.80 (the  Fixed Conversion Price ) or (b) 75% of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of the common stock of  (the  VWAP ) in the 20 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the applicable conversion date. At any time after the issue date of the Notes, the holder may convert the 10% Notes into shares of our common stock at the holder s option. The conversion price will be the Fixed Conversion Price. Subject to certain exclusions, if we sell or issues its common stock or certain common stock equivalents at an effective price per share that is lower than the Fixed Conversion Price, the conversion price will be reduced to equal to such lower price.

On March 18, 2016, we also  issued  Old Main an 8% Convertible Promissory Note (the  8% Note ) in the principal amount of $200,000 for Old Main s commitment to  enter  into an equity line transaction with us and prepare all of the related transaction documents. The 8% Note bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum. As a result of the Amendment, we also deferred the commencement of amortization payments on the 8% Note so that they now commence at the earlier of February 3, 2017 or on the SEC Effective Date.  On such date, we must begin to redeem 1/6th of the face amount of the 8% Note and any accrued but unpaid interest on a monthly basis. Such amortization payment may be made, at the option of the Company, in cash or, subject to certain conditions, in common stock of the Company pursuant to a conversion rate equal to the lower of (a) $1.07 (the  8% Note Fixed Conversion Price ) or (b) 75% of the lowest VWAP in the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is immediately prior to the applicable conversion date.  Subject to certain exclusions, if we sell or issue our common stock or certain common stock equivalents at an effective price per share that is lower than the 8% Note Fixed Conversion Price, the conversion price will be reduced to equal to such lower price.

On April 18, 2016, we also entered into an equity line agreement with Old Main whereby we may issue and sell to Old Main, at our option from time to time, up to $4,000,000 of our common stock at a purchase price equal to 80% of the lowest VWAP of the common stock during a five day  Valuation Period,  provided, however, that we may not sell any such common stock until the SEC Effective Date.  Pursuant to the Amendment, the term of the equity line agreement, which is 24 months, expires 24 months after the date of the Amendment.

During July 2016, we issued convertible promissory notes in favor of Mr. Koretsky and Mr. Binder.  These notes represent deferred salary of $250,000 due to Mr. Binder and prior advances in the amount of $12,750 from Mr. Binder, and $210,000 in advances from Mr. Koretsky, being reclassified as convertible notes payable. These notes are unsecured and bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum. No payments are required until July 1, 2017, at which time all accrued interest becomes due and payable. Principal will be paid in eight equal quarterly installments, together with accrued interest, beginning on October 1, 2017. At the note holder s election, at any time prior to payment or prepayment of the loans in full, all principal and accrued interest under the loans may be converted, in whole or in part, into our securities. Upon such an election, the holder will receive one  Unit  for each $1.07 converted, with each Unit consisting of one (1) share of common stock and a five-year warrant to purchase (1) share of common stock at a price of $1.07 per share.

On August 3, 2016, we borrowed $150,000 from CLS CO 2016, an entity affiliated with Mr. Koretsky.   This note is unsecured and bears interest at the rate of 15% per annum. All interest accruing during the first year will be added to principal.  Commencing on November 1, 2017, principal will be payable in four equal quarterly installments, together with accrued interest.  At the note holder s election, at any time prior to payment or prepayment of the loan in full, all principal and accrued interest under the loan may be converted, in whole or in part, into our securities. Upon such an election, the holder will receive one  Unit  for each $1.07 converted, with each Unit consisting of one (1) share of common stock and a five-year warrant to purchase (1) share of common stock at a price of $1.07 per share.

To fund operations during the three months ended August 31, 2016, we also borrowed $15,000, net of repayments of $24,000, from Jeffrey Binder, an officer and director of the Company, and $140,000 from Frank Koretsky, a director of the Company.

Over the next twelve months we will require significant additional capital to cover our projected cash flow deficits due to the Colorado Arrangement and related agreements, the repayment of the April 2015 Note, payments on the 10% Notes and 8% Note, payments on the loans from Jeffrey Binder and Frank Koretsky, the implementation of our business plan, and the development of alternative revenue sources.  Additionally, we anticipate that we will devote resources to research and development related to the refinement of our patent pending proprietary methods and processes and development of new products. We estimate research and development costs of between $50,000 and $100,000 during the next 12 months.  Finally, during the next 18-24 months, we plan to construct and open two to three processing facilities for use either by a licensee or by us directly.  We anticipate that the build out and opening of each processing facility will require between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000 in capital, with additional capital required for liquidity to cover personnel, equipment, and other operating expenses with respect to each opened facility. 

We currently have two employees, Jeffrey Binder, who serves as our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Alan Bonsett, who serves as our Chief Operating Officer.   In an effort to assist us conserve cash, Mr. Binder converted all accrued salary due to him through May 31, 2016 into a convertible promissory note and has deferred all of his salary (approximately $37,500 as of August 31, 2016) to date for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2017.

We do not currently have the capital necessary to meet our liquidity needs, fund our capital requirements or implement our business plan. We intend to fund our cash flow and capital requirements during the next year from the proceeds of the unissued 10% Notes and the Equity Line, the sale of our debt and equity securities, by obtaining additional loans and with cash generated through operations in connection with the Colorado Arrangement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our needs, however, as we have not yet received any commitments for the purchase of our equity securities or for additional loans.  Further, although we anticipate that we will begin receiving payments pursuant to the Licensing Agreement and Equipment Lease during the first quarter of 2017, the Colorado Arrangement has not generated revenue to date and, as described above, there can be no assurance that it will ever generate sufficient cash to repay the $500,000 loan from CLS Labs Colorado or to meet PRH s obligations under the Licensing Agreement or Equipment Lease. We anticipate that we will incur operating losses during the next twelve months.    

Going concern

Our financial statements were prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred continuous losses from operations since inception, have an accumulated deficit of $4,740,961 and had a working capital deficit of $1,232,141 at August 31, 2016. In addition, we do not currently have the cash resources to meet our operating commitments during the next twelve months. Our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, and complications frequently encountered by developmental stage companies.

Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our cash needs, to borrow capital and to sell equity to support the opening of processing facilities and to finance ongoing operations. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional debt or equity capital and/or that cash generated by our future operations will be adequate to meet our needs. These factors, among others, indicate that we may be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Management uses various estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Accounting estimates that are the most important to the presentation of our results of operations and financial condition, and which require the greatest use of judgment by management, are designated as our critical accounting estimates. We have the following critical accounting estimates:

Estimates and assumptions used in valuation of derivative liability: Management utilizes a lattice model to estimate the fair value of derivative liabilities. The model includes subjective assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

Accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )  are subject to change. Changes in such standards may have an impact on the Company s future financial statements. The following are a summary of recent accounting developments.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), to reduce the complexity of certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. ASU 2016-09 involves changes in several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for the income tax consequences of share-based awards.  For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.  We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which is intended to improve financial reporting in connection with leasing transactions. ASU 2016-02 will require entities ( lessees ) that lease assets with lease terms of more than twelve months to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Under ASU 2016-02, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation will be recorded for all leases, whether operating or finance, while the income statement will reflect lease expense for operating leases and amortization/interest expense for finance leases.  The treatment of entities that own the assets leased by lessees ( lessors ) will remain largely unchanged from current GAAP. In addition, ASU 2016-02 requires disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.  A modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Although we are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-02 to assess the impact on our consolidated financial statements, the primary effect of adopting the new standard will be to record assets and obligations for current operating leases.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ), which requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent within a classified balance sheet.  Previous guidance required deferred tax liabilities and assets to be separated into current and noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet.  We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 ), which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value, except for companies using the Retail Inventory Method which will continue to use existing impairment models.  ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ACU No. 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ). This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective on January 1, 2017 and must be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

This item is not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, among other things, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Jeffrey Binder, our Chief Executive Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on the evaluation, Mr. Binder concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in timely alerting him to material information relating to us that is required to be included in our periodic SEC filings and ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief financial officer, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, for the following reasons:

We do not have an independent board of directors or audit committee or adequate segregation of duties; and

We do not have an independent body to oversee our internal controls over financial reporting and lack segregation of duties due to our limited resources.

We plan to rectify these weaknesses by implementing an independent board of directors and hiring additional accounting personnel once we have additional resources to do so.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
