FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
certain forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The statements herein which are not historical reflect our current expectations and projections
about the Company s future results, performance, liquidity, financial condition, prospects and opportunities and are based
upon information currently available to us and our management and our interpretation of what we believe to be significant factors
affecting our business, including many assumptions about future events. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding,
among other things: 

our ability to produce, market and generate sales of our products and services;   

our ability to develop and/or introduce new products and services;   

our projected future sales, profitability and other financial metrics;   

our future financing plans;   

our anticipated needs for working capital;   

the anticipated trends in our industry;   

our ability to expand our sales and marketing capability;    

acquisitions of other companies or assets that we might undertake in the future;   

competition existing today or that will likely arise in the future; and   

other factors discussed elsewhere herein.   

Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions
and describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words  may, 
 should,   will,   plan,   could,   target,   contemplate, 
 predict,   potential,   continue,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate, 
 believe,   intend,   seek,  or  project  or the negative of these words or other
variations on these or similar words. Actual results, performance, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, prospects
and opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements as a result
of various risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the ability to raise sufficient capital to continue the Company s
operations. These statements may be found under Part I, Item 2  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,  as well as elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q generally. Actual events
or results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including,
without limitation, matters described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

In light of these risks and uncertainties,
there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will in fact occur. 

Potential investors should not place undue
reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, there is no undertaking
to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances
or any other reason. 

The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such statements are presented only
as a guide about future possibilities and do not represent assured events, and we anticipate that subsequent events and developments
will cause our views to change. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as
of any date after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains
estimates and other statistical data prepared by independent parties and by us relating to market size and growth and other data
about our industry. These estimates and data involve a number of assumptions and limitations, and potential investors are cautioned
not to give undue weight to these estimates and data. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data
generated by independent parties and contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, projections, assumptions and
estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industries in which we operate are necessarily subject to
a high degree of uncertainty and risk. 

Potential investors should not make an investment
decision based solely on our projections, estimates or expectations.

1.    ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS    

American Education Center, Inc.
( AEC New York ) is a New York Corporation organized on November 8, 1999 and is licensed by the Education Department
of the State of New York to engage in education related consulting services between the United States and China. 

On May 7, 2014, the President/sole
shareholder of AEC New York formed a new company ( AEC Nevada ) in the State of Nevada with the same name. On May 31,
2014, the President/sole shareholder of AEC New York exchanged his 200 shares for 10,563,000 shares of AEC Nevada. This exchange
made AEC New York a wholly owned subsidiary of AEC Nevada, collectively the  Company.  

The Company s primary goal
is to build upon the concept of  one-stop comprehensive services  for international students, educators, and institutions.
The Company has been devoted to international education exchanges, by providing educational and career enrichment opportunities
for students, teachers, and educational institutions between China and the United States. The Company currently provides admission,
visa, housing and other consulting services to Chinese students wishing to study in the United States. The Company also provides
exchange and placement services for qualified United States educators to teach in China. In addition, the Company provides localization
consulting services which are for employees coming to the United States to work for multi-national companies with operations here. 

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Basis of Accounting and Presentation  

The unaudited interim financial
statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) which apply to interim financial statements. 
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes normally required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, such information contains all adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. The
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for future quarters or for the year ending December 31, 2016.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Basis of Accounting and Presentation
(continued)  

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America ( GAAP ). The consolidated financial statements are comprised of AEC Nevada and its wholly
owned subsidiary, AEC New York. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Accounts Receivable  

The Company carries its accounts
receivable at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts if required. On a periodic basis, management evaluates accounts receivable
balances and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts, based on history of past write-offs and collections, when necessary.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company considers all accounts receivable to be fully collectible and, therefore, did not provide
for an allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue
is recorded pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
605,  Revenue Recognition , when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the services has occurred, the
fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 

The Company
offers a limited refund policy to students who have received consulting services regarding their H1B visas. Services for H1B consulting
are prepaid. The Company prepares the filing for the visas for $2,000, which is non-refundable. If the visa application is accepted,
the remaining prepayment will be recognized as revenue, if not, the remaining prepayment is refunded. The unearned prepaid advances
are shown as  advances from clients  in the consolidated balance sheets.

Concentration of Credit and Business
Risk  

The Company maintains its cash accounts
at 3 commercial banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insures up to $250,000 per bank for the total
of all depository accounts. At September 30, 2016, there were no cash balances in excess of the FDIC insured limits. 

The following table represents certain
information about the Company s major customers which individually accounted for more than 10% of the Company s gross
revenue for the nine months ended September 30:

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Stock-Based Compensation  

The fair value of stock options
issued to third party consultants and to employees, officers and directors are recorded in accordance with the measurement and
recognition criteria of FASB ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees  and FASB ASC 718,  Compensation  
Stock Based Compensation , respectively. 

The options are valued using the
Black-Scholes valuation method. This model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number
of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to the Company s expected stock price volatility
over the expected term of the awards, and actual and projected stock option exercise behaviors. 

Because the Company s stock
options have characteristics different from those of its traded stock, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of such stock. 

Income Taxes  

The Company accounts for income
taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ), which requires the recognition of deferred
income taxes for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences for those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible
when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available
to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized. 

ASC 740 also addresses the determination
of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under
ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is  more likely than not 
that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position would be measured based on the largest benefit that
has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition of
income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and accounting for
interest and penalties associated with tax positions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company does not have
a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)  

Fair Value of Financial Measurements

FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurement ,
specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other
market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs). In accordance with
ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy: 

Level 1 Inputs   
     Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access.  

Level 2 Inputs   
     Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.  

Level 3 Inputs   
     Inputs based on prices or valuation techniques that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurements.  

FASB ASC 820 requires the use of
observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different
levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs. 

The Company did not identify any
assets or liabilities that are required to be presented at fair value on a recurring basis. Non-derivative financial instruments
include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses, loan from stockholder and advances
from clients. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximated their
fair values due to their short term nature. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Earnings (Loss) per Share  

The Company computes net income
(loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share  ( ASC 260 ). Under the provisions
of ASC 260, basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the amount available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. 

Diluted earnings per share is based
on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options are converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying
the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or
at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price
during the period. The Company s common stock equivalents were excluded in the computation of diluted net (loss) per share
since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Basic and diluted shares outstanding are the same for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015 and 2016. Total shares issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding stock options for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

3.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS    

In February 2016, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU ) 2016-02,  Leases . The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU )
model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense
recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and
operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the
new standard on our financial statements.

   FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015   

3.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (continued)  

In August 2014, the FASB issued
ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40):   Disclosure of Uncertainties about
an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  ASU 2014-15 provides guidance in GAAP about management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
footnote disclosures. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The
amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim
periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company s financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU
2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605,  Revenue
Recognition . The core principle of this updated guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. The new rule also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments
and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This guidance, after amendment is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Companies are permitted
to adopt this new rule following either a full or modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. This accounting
standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

4.    SECURITY DEPOSITS  

The Company has security deposits
with the landlords of $266,021 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

5.    DEFERRED REVENUE  

The Company
receives advance payments for services to be performed and recognizes deferred revenue when the services have been rendered. The
deferred revenue at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0 and $553,624, respectively.

6.    ADVANCES FROM CLIENTS  

The services
for H1B visas require prepayment to the Company which has been shown as advances from clients on the balance sheets. 

The advances
from clients at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $157,469 and $63,679, respectively. The Company has received all
the results on the 2016 H1B applications as of September 30, 2016, revenue was recognized for the cases selected, all remaining
advances will be refunded by the end of 2016. 

7.    RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

The loan from stockholder represents
an unsecured non-interest bearing loan, arising from expenses paid on behalf of the Company. The loan is due on demand. 

The Company s President/Chairman/Chief
Financial Officer/Secretary has a 34% interest in Columbia International College, Inc. ( CIC ). In the normal course
of business, the Company conducts certain transactions with CIC. Included in accounts receivable is an amount due from CIC of $21,500
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company paid $25,000 and $245,000 for consulting services to CIC for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

8.    LONG-TERM LOAN  

On December 1, 2014, a third party,
who is also a client, loaned the Company $295,579, with interest at 10%. The loan is to be repaid on December 13, 2019. Interest
will be paid on the last day of each quarter from 2015 to 2019, except for the last payment on December 12, 2019. The Company paid
the interest for the first, second, and third quarter at the end of December, 2015. The Company paid the interest for the fourth
quarter of 2015 in January 2016, which created a technical default for late payment. A waiver was issued on March 23, 2016 to waive
this default. The Company paid the interest for each of the three months periods ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September
30, 2016. Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $7,398, $22,167, $7,949, and $24,519,
respectively.

however, due to renovation issues, the lease was changed and commenced on March 1, 2015 and the Company received two months of
free rent. Due to free rent and escalating monthly rental, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses,
the lease has been straight-lined for financial statement purposes which created deferred rent as shown on the balance sheets.
In November 2015, the Company entered into a sublease agreement to lease space to an unrelated third party for a monthly rental
of $3,000 for the first three months and $1,500 for the remainder of the lease term. The sublease commenced on December 1, 2015
and expires on November 30, 2016. In November 2015, the Company entered into another sublease agreement to lease space to an unrelated
third party for a monthly rental of $20,000. The sublease commenced on April 1, 2016 and expires on March 31, 2017. The sublease
income will be netted against the Company s rent expense. The future rent income to be received in 2016 and 2017 will be
$60,120 and $60,120, respectively. Rent expense, net of sublease income, was approximately $33,000, $168,000, $153,000 and $381,000
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Future minimum lease commitments
are as follows:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The following discussion of the results of
our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related
notes thereto, which appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except for the historical information contained herein,
the following discussion, as well as other information in this report, contain  forward-looking statements,  within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and are subject to the  safe harbor  created by those sections. Forward-looking statements are based on information
we have when those statements are made or management s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. Actual
results and the timing of the events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number
of factors, including those discussed in the  Forward-Looking Statements  set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. 

Description of Business  

American Education Center Inc. was incorporated
in Nevada ( AEC Nevada ) in May 2014 as a holding company, and operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, American
Education Center Inc., incorporated in the state of New York in 1999 ( AEC New York ). AEC Nevada, together with its
wholly owned subsidiary AEC New York, is referred to as the  Company.  The Company is devoted to international education
exchange and provides education-related consulting services such as educational and career enrichment opportunities to students,
educators and educational institutions in both the PRC and the United States. 

AEC New York was approved and licensed by the
Education Department of the state of New York in 2003 to engage in education consulting service between the U.S. and China. For
fifteen years, AEC New York has devoted itself to international education exchange between China and the United States, by providing
education and career enrichment opportunities for students, teachers, and educational institutions from both countries. 

Our mission is to provide  one-stop comprehensive
services  to international students, educators, educational institutions and corporate entities. Our services include admission
applications, visa applications, accommodations and other consulting services to Chinese students who wish to study in the United
States, placement services to qualified American educators to teach and live in China, as well as U.S. relocation services to employees
of multi-national companies with U.S. operations. 

Currently, we primarily provide four types
of services: Students Services, Educator Placements, Institution Services, as well as Executive Services. Services to our clients
are provided through the Company s principal executive office in New York, NY, and the three local representative offices
in China - Nanjing and Chengdu, as well as a recently opened one in Hangzhou. We plan to open more representative offices in China
in the future. Our representative offices are registered with their respective local administrations of industry and commerce effective
from August 12, 2014 to August 12, 2019, from February 17, 2014 to February 26, 2019, and from June 1, 2015 to February 12, 2018
respectively. The Company entered into cooperation contracts with business partners in Jiangxi, Shanghai and Shenzhen on May 29,
2014, June 10, 2014 and May 7, 2014, respectively, allowing our business partners to set up representative offices bearing the
name of America Education Center in each of these locations. However, as of the date of this quarterly report, we have not yet
set up representative offices in Jiangxi, Shanghai or Shenzhen, nor have we registered with local authorities to operate our businesses
in these locations. 

Our Student Services provide guidance and consulting
services to help our customers throughout their application and admission process and during their study and also help them find
internship and other career opportunities in the United States. The Company categorizes this service into three programs: academic,
life and career. Our academic program focuses on providing admission services, English as a Second Language (ESL) training program,
the Elite 100 program, and University Placement Services (UPS) for Chinese students to study in the U.S. Our life program offers
consulting services, including personalized VIP service, to assist our Chinese customers to settle down in the U.S. so they can
focus effectively on their studies. The Company will refer its customers to the Company s business partners in the U.S. to
assist the customers with purchasing real estate properties, understanding financial management and investment, buying insurance
and starting businesses. Our Career Program focuses on assisting clients to improve their career development by identifying internship
and work opportunities that are suitable to their educational background and experience level. 

Our Educator Placement Program is designed
to meet the increasing demands for foreign teachers in both the U.S. and China. Our program helps teachers in the U.S. or China
who plan to gain experience in another country find the most suitable positions. We also recruit and place native English speaking
teachers for our clients and business partners in China, and recruit and place Chinese-speaking teachers in U.S. educational institutions. 

Our Institution Services Program is mainly
focused on providing recruiting and consulting services to U.S. schools, colleges and universities to enroll students from China. 

Our University Pathway Program (UPP) was established
in 2008 and has been offering consulting services to various U.S. universities to enroll qualified international students to such
universities and explore possible collaborations with selected universities in China. For our Student Exchange Programs, we recruit
and enroll Chinese students in U.S. educational institutions for Exchange Programs (students still finish their diploma in China).
As part of these programs, we have engaged St. Peter s University to serve as a Chinese education consultant since they are
more experienced in Student Exchange Programs. 

Pursuant to our Executive Services program,
we also provide services to our clients whose executives are moving to the U.S. for work. We assist them in all aspects of relocation
as well as their preparation for visa applications. 

Prior to December 31, 2013, in certain cases,
we collected our service fees in advance from clients. If we were not successful in all of the promised services, these fees were
refundable. Accordingly, until all the promised work was completed successfully, these fees were shown as deferred revenue. Commencing
in 2014, in order to better manage our company financially, we changed our policy. We now have discontinued utilizing the refund
provisions in our consulting agreements and recognize deferred revenue based on completion of the service. The Company offers a
limited refund policy to students who have received consulting services regarding their H1B visas. Consulting services for H1B
are prepaid. A portion (in the amount of $2,000) of such prepayment will become non-refundable once the Company completes preparation
and files visa applications on behalf of the clients. If the visa application is accepted, the remaining prepayment will be recognized
as revenue, if not, the remaining prepayment will be refunded. 

Opportunities  

We intend to expand our business as follows, although there is no
guarantee that we will carry out our growth strategy as expected: 

Organic Growth    

We plan to organize our sales efforts
to create organic growth from existing clients. From our existing client base, we will provide the highest level of individual
services to help our clients in any way to have a smooth transition to the U.S., including visa consulting services, travel guides,
life advice, investment consulting and other services. 

Relationships    

Through 15 years of continuous growth,
we have built significant industry credibility and a solid reputation, which enables us to partner with quality third-party businesses
in providing services to our clients when needed, which provides quality services efficiently and at a competitive cost. These
relationships enable us to operate at a competitive cost, while keeping our core business competitive. 

Online Service Development    

The Internet allows people to gain
access to online resources and services without the limitation of location and time, and providing services over the Internet often
increases the revenue for many companies. We are developing our own web-based products to better reach and serve additional customers
who would otherwise not benefit from our services, while we continue to expand our business network through our institutional clients. 

Results of Operation  

Below we have included a discussion of our
operating results and material changes in the periods covered by this Form 10-Q periodic report. Our revenue and operating results
normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our enrollments and the extent of expenses required in using
consulting services from third parties. Our student population varies as a result of new enrollments and other reasons that we
cannot always anticipate. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of various enrollment patterns
and changes in expenses. The Company is working on expanding its businesses and stabilizing the sources of its revenues, as well
as controlling its overhead cost. 

For additional information on the potential
risks associated with these initiatives and our operations, please refer to the Risk Factors sections in our annual report on Form
10-K for the period ended December 31,2015, filed as of April 12, 2016 

The following table sets forth information
from our statements of operations for the three months and nine months period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

AMERICAN EDUCATION CENTER, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARY   

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF
OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015   

Revenue   

Revenues from educational programs, executive
services, and consulting services for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 were $.97 million, representing a decrease
of $.68 million or 41% from $1.65 million in the three months period ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of revenue was mainly
due to the Company s decision to apply more strict standards on screening its clients. Our revenue of $.97 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of student VIP-services refund of $.01 million, and consulting revenue to Company
of $.98 million. 

Consulting Services   

Consulting services were part of our costs
and expenses. We retain unrelated third parties to provide us with consulting services. For the three-month period ended September
30, 2016, this item was $.79 million, representing an decrease of $1.13 million or 59% from $1.92 million in the three months period
ended September 30, 2015. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities, and include costs related to human resources, information
technology and legal organizations, bad debt expense, interest expense, marketing, advertising and promotion, as well as fees for
professional services and commission fees. Our general and administrative expenses were $.31 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, and $.63 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $.33 million or 52%. The decrease
in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the fact that the company s decision to apply more strict
standards on screening its clients. It led to a decrease of commission fees of $.36 million in the third quarter of 2016. 

Income taxes   

Income taxes for the three months ended September
30, 2016 relate principally to the adjusted estimation of 2016 state and city minimal tax liability, deferred tax assets based
on current year profit and loss trend    and
changes in tax reserves. Income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2015 relate principally to the creation of a 50%
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets principally for operating losses, due to the uncertainty in realizing the full tax
benefits.         

Net Loss   

As a result of the foregoing, we had net loss
attributable to the Company and its subsidiaries of $.05 million, or loss of $0.00 per share basic and diluted, for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net loss of $.25 million, or a loss per share of $0.01 per share basic and diluted for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our net loss was primarily attributable to the company s decision to apply more
strict standards on screening its clients. 

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and
2015   

Revenue  

Revenues from educational programs, executive
service, and consulting services for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $4.88 million, an increase of .30 million or
6% from $4.58 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The growth was mainly driven by an increase in the number of
clients engaging our student VIP services and an increase in demand for our institutional services from China due to the expansion
of our business, offset by a decrease in parent services. Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $4.88 million
consisted of parent service of .05 million, student VIP-service of $.92 million, and consulting revenue to the Company service
of $3.91 million. 

Consulting Services   

Consulting services were part of our costs
and expenses. We retain unrelated third parties to provide us with consulting services. For the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016, this item was $3.85 million, representing an increase of $1.02 million or 36% from $2.82 million in the nine months period
ended September 30, 2015. The increase in consulting services is primarily attributable to the increase in the demand of our services,
which in turn increase the need for consulting services. 

For nine month ended September 30, 2016, growth
of revenue falls behind of consulting service because ever since the end of 2015, some clients took advantage of the open-ended
nature of AEC s agreement with its vender and kept engage the venders, therefore generating consulting service charges to
AEC, after their contract with AEC has closed. This mismatch of non-revenue and cost prompted AEC to develop and apply more strict
standards in screening its clients. 

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities, and include costs related to human resources, information
technology and legal organizations, bad debt expense, interest expense, marketing, advertising and promotion, as well as fees for
professional services and commission fees. Our general and administrative expenses were $1.17 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, and $1.80 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $.64 million or 35%. The decrease
in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to decrease of $.84 million of commission fees, $.21 million in
rent expense, offset by increase of $.14 million in marketing and advertising expense, $.05 million in professional fees. 

Income taxes   

Income
taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 relate principally to reconciliation between 2015 tax liability based on estimation
and based on filing, the estimation of 2016 state and city minimal tax liability and deferred tax assets based on current year
profit and loss trend    and changes in tax reserves.  Income taxes for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 relate principally to the creation of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets principally
for operating losses, due to the uncertainty in realizing the full tax benefits.    

Net Loss   

As a result of the foregoing, we had net loss
attributable to the Company and its subsidiaries of $.08 million, or a loss of $0.00 per share basic and diluted, for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net loss of $.15 million, or loss of $.01 per share basic and diluted for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our current assets primarily consist of cash
and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We have financed our operations through our cash from operations, and loans from
our major stockholder. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements
through at least the next 12 months. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had a working
capital of $.36 million, a decrease of $.03 million or 7% from a working capital of $.39 million as of December 31, 2015. The decrease
in working capital is the net effect of a decreasing cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expense and decreasing accounts payable
and accrued expense, income tax payable, deferred revenue and advance from clients. The decrease in accounts receivable and decrease
in accounts payable reflect the management s efforts on timely collection and payment.  

As of September 30, 2016, we had accounts receivable
of $.80 million, a decrease of $.32 million from    accounts receivable $1.12 million as
of December 31, 2015, mainly due to the mainly due to our establishing a new and more effective collection program. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash
equivalent of $.28million, a decrease of $.81 million or 74% from $1.10 million as of December 31, 2015. 

As of September 30, 2016, we do not have any
deferred revenue, a decrease of $.55 million from December 31, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to the management s decision
to discontinue providing H1B visa-related services that generate deferred revenue and
the recognition of existing deferred revenue services during 2016. See Note 2
 Revenue Recognition  and Note 5 of Financial Statement for more information. 

The following tables sets forth selected cash flow information for
the periods indicated: 

AMERICAN EDUCATION CENTER, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARY   

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)  

Cash flow in Operating Activities   

Net change in cash for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $-.81 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $.81 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. We had a net loss of $.08 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, minus effect of accounts payable
settlement $.69 million, deferred revenue recognition $.55 million, offset by collection of accounts receivable of $.32 million,
equity based payment of $.10 million. The net effect of change in cash was a decrease of $.81 million. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

Our consolidated interim financial statements
and condensed notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the
SEC. The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters
that are inherently uncertain. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements.
Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to
those of companies in similar businesses. A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they
involve significant The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction
with our condensed financial statement and other disclosures included in this report. We believe that the following accounting
policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant accounting
estimates. 

The Company has assessed all newly issued accounting
pronouncements released during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and through the date of this filing, and believes none
of them will have a material impact on the Company s financial statements when or if adopted. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    

We did not have, during the periods presented, and we are currently
not party to, any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Seasonality    

Other than our H1B consulting service, we do
not have a seasonal business cycle. Because the great majority of H1B applications are filed under the annual H1B quota cap system,
the majority of our H1B related consulting services is provided to clients prior to April 1, and until the time when the quota
cap for such year is fulfilled, typically sometime in April or the near future. Otherwise, our operating results from other business
segments are generally derived evenly throughout the fiscal year. 

Subsequent Events   

The Company s management has performed
subsequent events procedures through November 14, 2016, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available
to be issued. There were no subsequent events requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.

regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Furthermore, smaller reporting companies face additional
limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and find it difficult to properly segregate duties. Often, one
or two individuals control every aspect of the Company's operation and are in a position to override any system of internal control.
Additionally, smaller reporting companies tend to utilize general accounting software packages that lack a rigorous set of software
controls.    

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s
management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of September 30, 2016. The Company does not have a Chief Financial Officer that is familiar with the accounting
and reporting requirements of a U.S. publicly listed company. In addition, the Company does not believe it has sufficient documentation
concerning its existing financial processes, risk assessment and internal controls. There are also certain deficiencies in the
design or operation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting that has adversely affected its disclosure
controls that may be considered to be  material weaknesses.   

We plan to designate individuals responsible
for identifying reportable developments and to implement procedures designed to remediate the material weakness by focusing additional
attention and resources on our internal accounting functions. However, the identified material weakness will not be considered
remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through
testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
