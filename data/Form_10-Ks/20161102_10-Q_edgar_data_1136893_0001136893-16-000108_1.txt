Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, all references to  FIS,   we,  the  Company  or the  registrant  are to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Georgia corporation, and its subsidiaries. 
    
  (1) Basis of Presentation 
    
  The unaudited financial information included in this report includes the accounts of FIS and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. All adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. This report should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as updated by the Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 2, 2016 for changes in our reporting segments. The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain reclassifications have been made in the   2015   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) to conform to the classifications used in   2016  . 
    
  On August 12, 2015, FIS and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SunGard and SunGard Capital Corp. II (collectively  SunGard ) pursuant to which, through a series of mergers, FIS acquired SunGard (collectively the "SunGard acquisition").   FIS completed the SunGard acquisition on November 30, 2015 (Note 4) and SunGard's results of operations and financial position are included in the consolidated financial statements from and after the date of acquisition.  
    
  We report the results of our operations in   three   reporting segments: Integrated Financial Solutions ( IFS ), Global Financial Solutions ( GFS ) and Corporate and Other (Note 10).  

(2) Related Party Transactions 
    
  The Company operates a joint venture ("Brazilian Venture") with Banco Bradesco S.A. ("Banco Bradesco"), in which we own a   51%   controlling interest, to provide comprehensive, fully-outsourced transaction processing, call center, cardholder support and collection services to multiple card issuing clients in Brazil, including Banco Bradesco.  The original accounting for this transaction resulted in the establishment of a contract intangible asset and a liability for amounts payable to the original partner banks upon final migration of their respective card portfolios and achieving targeted volumes (the  Brazilian Venture Notes ).   The unamortized contract intangible asset balance as of   September 30, 2016   was   $92 million  .  The carrying value of the noncontrolling interest as of   September 30, 2016   was   $90 million  . 
    
  The Company recorded revenues of   $75 million   and   $58 million   during the three months and   $195 million   and   $183 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, from Banco Bradesco.  Revenues included   $5 million   and   $(22) million   of favorable (unfavorable) currency impact during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and Brazilian Real in   2016   as compared to   2015  .   
    
  A summary of the Company s related party receivables and payables is as follows (in millions):

(3) Net Earnings per Share 
    
  The basic weighted average shares and common stock equivalents for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are computed using the treasury stock method. 
    
  The following table summarizes the earnings per share attributable to FIS common stockholders for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions, except per share amounts): 

Options to purchase approximately   1 million   shares or less of our common stock for the three months and   7 million   and   1 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. 

(4) Acquisitions 
    
           SunGard 
    
  FIS completed the SunGard acquisition on November 30, 2015, and SunGard's results of operations and financial position are included in the consolidated financial statements from and after the date of acquisition.  The SunGard acquisition increased our existing portfolio of solutions to automate a wide range of complex business processes for financial services institutions and corporate and government treasury departments, adding trading, securities operations, administering investment portfolios, accounting for investment assets, and managing risk and compliance requirements.  
    
  Through a series of mergers, FIS acquired   100   percent of the equity of SunGard, for a total purchase price as follows (in millions):

We recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to SunGard tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of November 30, 2015.  The provisional amounts for intangible assets were based on independent third-party valuations performed.  Land and building valuations were based on appraisals performed by certified property appraisers. Goodwill was recorded as the residual amount by which the purchase price exceeded the provisional fair value of the net assets acquired.  Our evaluations of the facts and circumstances available as of November 30, 2015 to assign fair values to other assets acquired and liabilities assumed are ongoing, as are our assessments of the economic characteristics of the acquired software and other intangibles.  These evaluations may result in changes to the provisional amounts recorded.   In accordance with ASU 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  , the financial statements will not be retrospectively adjusted for any measurement-period adjustments that occur in subsequent periods.  Rather, we will recognize any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, adjustments were recorded to increase the fair values assigned to intangible assets, deferred taxes, other liabilities and property and equipment and to reduce the value assigned to goodwill.   We are also required to record, in the same period s financial statements in which adjustments are recorded, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of any change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting adjustment had been completed at the acquisition date. Additional depreciation and amortization of   $6 million   that would have been recognized in 2015 was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2016  related to the changes in provisional values of intangible assets.   
    
  The preliminary purchase price allocation, as adjusted for measurement period adjustments recorded through September 30, 2016, is as follows (in millions):   

The following table summarizes the liabilities assumed in the SunGard acquisition (in millions):     

The gross contractual amount of trade receivables acquired was approximately   $546 million  .  The difference between that total and the provisional amount reflected above represents our best estimate     at the acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected.  This difference was derived using SunGard's historical bad debts, sales allowances and collection trends.

(5) Discontinued Operations and Other Dispositions 
    
  During the second quarter of 2015, we sold certain assets associated with our gaming industry check warranty business, resulting in a pre-tax gain of   $139 million  , which is included in Other income (expense), net.  The sale did not meet the standard necessary to be reported as discontinued operations; therefore, the gain and related prior period earnings remain reported within earnings from continuing operations.   
    
  Certain other operations are reported as discontinued in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Unaudited) as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

(6) Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details 
    
  The following table shows the Company s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions): 

The Company entered into capital lease obligations of    $16 million   and less than   $1 million   during the three months and   $18 million   and   $2 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The assets are included in property and equipment and the remaining capital lease obligations are classified as long-term debt on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) as of   September 30, 2016  .  Periodic payments are included in repayment of borrowings on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited).     
    
  Changes in goodwill during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are summarized as follows (in millions): 

As of September 30, 2016, intangible assets, net of amortization, includes   $5,004 million   of customer relationships and   $61 million   of finite-lived trademarks, as well as   $81 million   of non-amortizable assets consisting mainly of indefinite-lived trademarks.  Amortization expense for the quarter related to these intangible assets was   $127 million  . 
    
  Settlement Activity    
    
  We manage certain integrated electronic payment services and programs and wealth management processes for our clients that require us to hold and manage client cash balances used to fund their daily settlement activity.  Settlement deposits represent funds we hold that were drawn from our clients to facilitate settlement activities.  Settlement receivables represent amounts funded by us.  Settlement payables consist of settlement deposits from clients, settlement payables to third parties, and outstanding checks related to our settlement activities for which the right of offset does not exist or we do not intend to exercise our right of offset.  Our accounting policy for such outstanding checks is to include them in settlement payables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) and operating cash flows on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited).

(7) Long-Term Debt 
  Long-term debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , consisted of the following (in millions): 

__________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Interest on the 2017 Term Loans was generally payable at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up to   1.75%   based upon the Company's corporate credit ratings.  
               (3) 
    Interest on the Revolving Loan is generally payable at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of up to   1.75%   plus an unused commitment fee of up to   0.25%  , each based upon the Company's corporate credit ratings.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on the Revolving Loan, excluding fees, was   1.53%  .  
       
  On August 10, 2016, FIS amended and extended its syndicated credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") and paid down the balance of     $600 million     on the 2017 Term Loans. As     of   September 30, 2016  , the Credit Agreement provided total committed capital of   $3,000 million   in the form of a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Loan") maturing on August 10, 2021.  FIS is also a party to a syndicated term loan agreement (the "Term Loan Agreement" and together with the Credit Agreement the "FIS Credit Agreements"), which as of   September 30, 2016   provided term loans of   $900 million   maturing on November 30, 2018 (the "2018 Term Loans").  As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan was   $21 million  , with   $2,971 million   of borrowing capacity remaining thereunder (net of   $8 million   in outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Loan).  
    
  The obligations of FIS under the FIS Credit Agreements and under all of its outstanding senior notes rank equal in priority and are unsecured. The FIS Credit Agreements and the senior notes remain subject to customary covenants, including, among others, limitations on the payment of dividends by FIS, and events of default. 
    
  On August 11, 2016, FIS issued   $2,500   million of new senior notes, including   $750 million   of Senior Notes due in 2021 (the "2021 Notes") that bear interest at   2.250%  ,   $1,250 million   of Senior Notes due in 2026 (the "2026 Notes") that bear interest at   3.000%   and   $500 million   of Senior Notes due in 2046 (the "2046 Notes") that bear interest at   4.500%  . Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting discounts and underwriting fees, were   $2,461 million  . FIS used the proceeds to pay down the outstanding balance of its Revolving Loan and partially pay down the 2018 Term Loans.

     Table of Contents

  AND SUBSIDIARIES  
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 

Due to the extension of the Revolving Loan and issuance of the 2021, 2026, and 2046 Notes, FIS recorded approximately   $25 million   of deferred financing costs, which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the loan and notes. Also, as a result of the pay down of the 2017 Term Loans and the partial pay down of the 2018 Term Loans, FIS incurred a pre-tax charge upon extinguishment of approximately   $2 million   due to the write-off of associated previously capitalized debt issue costs.  
         
  The following summarizes the aggregate maturities of our debt and capital leases on stated contractual maturities, excluding unamortized non-cash bond premiums and discounts of   $36 million   as of   September 30, 2016   (in millions).   

Voluntary prepayment of the term loans is generally permitted at any time without fee.  There are no mandatory principal payments on the Revolving Loan and any balance outstanding on the Revolving Loan will be due and payable at its scheduled maturity date, which occurs at August 10, 2021.  
    
  We monitor the financial stability of our counterparties on an ongoing basis.  The lender commitments under the undrawn portions of the Revolving Loan are comprised of a diversified set of financial institutions, both domestic and international. The failure of any single lender to perform its obligations under the Revolving Loan would not adversely impact our ability to fund operations. 
    
  The fair value of the Company s long-term debt is estimated to be approximately   $523 million   higher than the carrying value as of   September 30, 2016  . This estimate is based on quoted prices of our senior notes and trades of our other debt in close proximity to   September 30, 2016  , which are considered Level 2-type measurements. This estimate is subjective in nature and involves uncertainties and significant judgment in the interpretation of current market data. Therefore, the values presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize or settle currently.  

(8) Financial Instruments 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our 2018 Term Loans and Revolving Loan from variable to fixed (in millions): 

___________________________________

We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and, as such, they are carried on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) at fair value with changes in fair value included in other comprehensive earnings, net of tax. 
    
  Due to the term loan and revolver reductions discussed in Note (7) Long-Term Debt, interest rate swaps with a notional amount totaling   $850 million   were terminated as of September 30, 2016. As a result, FIS recognized an approximate   $2 million   before tax loss due to the release of fair value changes from other comprehensive earnings.

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are Level 2-type measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps. Adjustments are made to these amounts and to accumulated other comprehensive earnings ("AOCE") within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Earnings (Unaudited) and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Equity (Unaudited) as the factors that impact fair value change, including current and projected interest rates, time to maturity and required cash transfers/settlements with our counterparties. Periodic actual and estimated settlements with counterparties are recorded to interest expense as a yield adjustment to effectively fix the otherwise variable rate interest expense associated with the Term and Revolving Loans for hedge notional amounts.

Our existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there was no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It is our practice to execute such instruments with credit-worthy banks at the time of execution and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe that our interest rate swap counterparties will be able to fulfill their obligations under our agreements, and we believe we will have debt outstanding through the various expiration dates of the swaps such that the forecasted transactions remain probable of occurring. 
    
  We also use currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in costs caused by variations in Indian Rupee ( INR ) exchange rates.  As of September 30, 2016, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately   $14 million   and the fair value was nominal.  These INR forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of these currency forward contracts is determined using currency exchange market rates, obtained from reliable, independent, third party banks, at the balance sheet date. The fair value of forward contracts is subject to changes in currency exchange rates. The Company has no ineffectiveness related to its use of currency forward contracts in connection with INR cash flow hedges. 

(9) Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Litigation 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various pending and threatened litigation matters related to operations, some of which include claims for punitive or exemplary damages. The Company believes no actions, other than the matters listed below, depart from customary litigation incidental to its business. As background to the disclosure below, please note the following: 

These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities. 

The Company reviews all of its litigation on an on-going basis and follows the authoritative provisions for accounting for contingencies when making accrual and disclosure decisions. A liability must be accrued if (a) it is probable that a liability has been incurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If one of these criteria has not been met, disclosure is required when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may be incurred. When assessing reasonably possible and probable outcomes, the Company bases decisions on the assessment of the ultimate outcome following all appeals. Legal fees associated with defending litigation matters are expensed as incurred. 
       
     DataTreasury Corporation v. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. et. al.    
    
  On May 28, 2013, DataTreasury Corporation (the  Plaintiff ) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Company and multiple banks in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division.  Plaintiff alleges that the Company infringes the patents at issue by making, using, selling or offering to sell systems and methods for image-based check processing.  The Plaintiff seeks damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees for the alleged infringement of   two   patents.  On October 25, 2013, the Company filed for covered business method ("CBM") post-grant reviews of the validity of the Plaintiff's asserted patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO").  The Company filed a Motion to Stay the case pending the outcome of the CBM post-grant reviews.  On April 29, 2014, the USPTO instituted the Company's   two   CBM petitions.  On August 14, 2014, the Court granted the Company's Motion to Stay the litigation pending the outcome of the CBM review proceedings.  On April 29, 2015, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB") issued final written decisions on the Company s   two   CBM petitions holding that all claims of the Plaintiff s   two   patents are unpatentable ("Final Written Decisions").  On August 27, 2015, the Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the USPTO s Final Written Decisions.  On October 13, 2016, the Federal Circuit affirmed the USPTO's Final Written Decisions finding the Plaintiff's   two   patents to be unpatentable.  Following this favorable decision, we believe the possibility of an adverse outcome in this matter is remote, and will hereafter discontinue discussing it in our financial statement footnotes absent some unexpected change. 
    
  Acquired Contingencies (SunGard) 
    
  The Company became responsible for certain contingencies which were assumed in the SunGard acquisition.  These matters include unclaimed property examinations and tax compliance matters. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 includes a liability of   $107 million   related to these matters. Of this liability,   $11 million   is considered provisional and is subject to further change as these contingencies are finalized.  Changes in this provisional liability during the

measurement period that result from new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are reflected in our purchase accounting for the SunGard acquisition, not through our income statement.  
    
  Reliance Trust Claims 
    
           Reliance Trust Company, the Company s subsidiary, is named as a defendant in a class action arising out of its provision of services as the outside trustee for a 401(k) Plan.  Plaintiffs in the action seek damages and attorneys  fees, as well as equitable relief, for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and prohibited transactions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  The action also makes claims against the Plan's sponsor and recordkeeper. Reliance Trust Company is vigorously defending the action and believes that it has meritorious defenses.  While we believe that the ultimate resolution of the matter will not have a material impact on our financial condition, we are unable at this time to make an estimate of potential losses arising from the action because the matter is at an early state and involves unresolved questions of fact and law. 

Brazilian Tax Authorities Claims 
    
  In 2004, Proservvi Empreendimentos e Servicos, Ltda., the predecessor to Fidelity National Servicos de Tratamento de Documentos e Informatica Ltda. ( Servicos ), a subsidiary of Fidelity National Participacoes Ltda., our former item processing and remittance services operation in Brazil, acquired certain assets and employees and leased certain facilities from the Transpev Group ( Transpev ) in Brazil.  Transpev s remaining assets were later acquired by Prosegur, an unrelated third party. When Transpev discontinued its operations after the asset sale to Prosegur, it had unpaid federal taxes and social contributions owing to the Brazilian tax authorities. The Brazilian tax authorities brought a claim against Transpev and beginning in 2012 brought claims against Prosegur and Servicos on the grounds that Prosegur and Servicos were successors in interest to Transpev.  To date, the Brazilian tax authorities filed   nine   claims against Servicos asserting potential tax liabilities of approximately   $14 million  .  There are potentially   27   additional claims against Transpev/Prosegur for which Servicos is named as a co-defendant or may be named, but for which Servicos has not yet been served.  These additional claims amount to approximately   $58 million   making the total potential exposure for all   36   claims approximately   $72 million  .  We do not believe a liability for these   36   total claims is probable or reasonably estimable and, therefore, have not recorded a liability for any of these claims. 
    
  Indemnifications and Warranties 
    
  The Company generally indemnifies its customers, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, against damages and costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, or trademark infringement associated solely with its customers' use of  the Company's software applications or services.  Historically, the Company has not made any material payments under such indemnifications, but continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and would recognize any such losses when they are estimable. In addition, the Company warrants to customers that its software operates substantially in accordance with the software specifications. Historically, no material costs have been incurred related to software warranties and no accruals for warranty costs have been made. 

(10) Segment Information 
    
  In 2015, FIS finalized a reorganization and began reporting its financial performance based on   three   segments: Integrated Financial Solutions ( IFS ), Global Financial Solutions ( GFS ) and Corporate and Other.  We recast all previous periods to conform to the new segment presentation.  Following the November 30, 2015 SunGard acquisition, SunGard was included within the GFS segment as its economic characteristics, international business model, and various other factors largely aligned with those of our GFS segment.  As we have further integrated the businesses in 2016, we have reclassified certain SunGard solutions that are oriented more to the retail banking and payments activities of IFS into that segment (corporate liquidity and wealth management).  Certain other non-strategic businesses from both SunGard (public sector and education) and legacy FIS (commercial services and check processing) have been reclassified to the Corporate and Other segment, as have SunGard administrative expenses.  Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation.   
      
  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income tax provision (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, including amortization of purchased intangibles), plus certain non-operating items.  This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in

conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting.  The non-operating items affecting the segment profit measure generally include acquisition accounting adjustments, acquisition, integration and severance costs, and restructuring expenses.  For consolidated reporting purposes, these costs and adjustments are recorded in the Corporate and Other segment for the periods discussed below.  Adjusted EBITDA for the respective segments excludes the foregoing costs and adjustments.

    Capital expenditures for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   include   $2 million   of capital leases.  
       
  Clients in Brazil, the United Kingdom, France and Germany accounted for the majority of the revenues from clients based outside of North America for all periods presented.  Long-term assets, excluding goodwill and other intangible assets, located outside of the United States total   $527 million   and   $359 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These assets are predominantly located in Brazil, India, Germany and the United Kingdom. 
    
  Integrated Financial Solutions ("IFS") 
    
  The IFS segment is primarily focused on serving the North American regional and community bank market for transaction and account processing, payment solutions, channel solutions (including lending and wealth management solutions), digital channels, risk and compliance solutions, and services, capitalizing on the continuing trend to outsource these solutions.  IFS also includes corporate liquidity and wealth management solutions acquired in the SunGard acquisition.  IFS  primary software applications function as the underlying infrastructure of a financial institution's processing environment. These applications include core bank processing software, which banks use to maintain the primary records of their customer accounts, and complementary applications and services that interact directly with the core processing applications.  Clients in this segment include regional and community banks, credit unions, commercial lenders, independent community and savings institutions as well as government institutions, merchants and other commercial organizations.  This market is primarily served through integrated solutions and characterized by multi-year processing contracts that generate highly recurring revenues.  The predictable nature of cash flows generated from this segment provides opportunities for further investments in innovation, product integration, information and security, and compliance in a cost effective manner. 
    
  Global Financial Solutions ("GFS") 
    
  The GFS segment is focused on serving the largest financial institutions around the globe with banking and payments solutions, as well as consulting and transformation services.  The GFS segment has extended its reach through the SunGard acquisition, and now also delivers a broader array of capital markets and asset management and insurance solutions and services.  We have   two   operating segments within GFS, International Banking   Payments and Institutional   Wholesale, which are differentiated by solution type and have been aggregated to form the Global Financial Solutions reportable segment.  International Banking   Payments provides solutions designed to meet the needs of the retail banking customers of global and international financial institutions, while Institutional   Wholesale is focused primarily on providing non-retail solutions to the global financial institutions we serve. 
    
  GFS clients include the largest global financial institutions, including those headquartered in the United States, as well as all international financial institutions we serve as clients in more than   130   countries around the world. These institutions face unique business and regulatory challenges and account for the majority of financial institution information technology spend globally. The purchasing patterns of GFS clients vary from those of IFS clients who typically purchase solutions on an outsourced basis. GFS clients purchase our solutions and services in various ways including licensing and managing technology  in-house , using consulting and third party service providers as well as fully outsourced end-to-end solutions. We have long-established relationships with many of these financial institutions that generate significant recurring revenue.  GFS clients now also include asset managers, buy- and sell-side securities and trading firms, insurers and private equity firms due to the addition of SunGard.  This segment also includes the Company's consolidated Brazilian Venture (Note 2).  
    
  Corporate and Other 
    
  The Corporate and Other segment consists of corporate overhead expense, certain leveraged functions and miscellaneous expenses that are not included in the operating segments as well as certain non-strategic businesses.  The overhead and leveraged costs relate to marketing, corporate finance and accounting, human resources, legal, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates revenue generating segment performance, such as acquisition integration and severance costs.  The Corporate and Other segment also includes the purchase accounting impact on revenue for 2016 of adjusting SunGard's deferred revenue as of the acquisition date to fair value.

Overview 
    
  FIS is a global leader in financial services technology with a focus on retail and institutional banking, payments, asset and wealth management, risk and compliance, consulting and outsourcing solutions.  Through the depth and breadth of our solutions portfolio, global capabilities and domain expertise, FIS serves more than 20,000 clients in over 130 countries. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS employs more than 55,000 people worldwide and holds global leadership positions in payment processing, financial software and banking solutions.  Providing software, services and outsourcing of the technology that empowers the financial world, FIS is a Fortune 500 company and is a member of Standard   Poor s 500  Index.  
    
  We have grown organically as well as through acquisitions, which have contributed critical applications and services that complement or enhance our existing offerings, diversifying our revenues by customer, geography and service offering.  The completion of the SunGard acquisition on November 30, 2015 increased our existing portfolio to include solutions that automate a wide range of complex business processes for financial services institutions and corporate and government treasury departments. 
    
  In 2015, FIS finalized a reorganization and began reporting its financial performance based on three segments: Integrated Financial Solutions ( IFS ), Global Financial Solutions ( GFS ) and Corporate and Other.  We recast all previous periods to conform to the new segment presentation.  Following the November 30, 2015 SunGard acquisition, SunGard was included within the GFS segment as its economic characteristics, international business model, and various other factors largely aligned with those of our GFS segment.  As we have further integrated the businesses in 2016, we have reclassified certain SunGard businesses that are oriented more to the retail banking and payments activities of IFS into that segment (corporate liquidity and wealth management).  Certain other non-strategic businesses from both SunGard (public sector and education) and legacy FIS (commercial services and check processing) have been reclassified to the Corporate and Other segment, as have SunGard administrative expenses.  Prior periods also have been reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation.  A description of these segments is included in Note 10. Revenues by segment and the adjusted EBITDA of our segments are discussed below in Segment Results of Operations. 
  Business Trends and Conditions 
    
  Our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services, consulting and professional services and software license fees.  The majority of our revenue has historically been recurring, and has been provided under multi-year contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream.  These services, in general, are considered critical to our clients' operations.  A significant portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of deposit accounts and card transactions, among other variable measures, associated with consumer and commercial activity.  Consulting and professional services revenues are typically non-recurring, and sales of software licenses are less predictable, a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients.  In the second half of 2015 and through the first nine months of 2016, we experienced the macroeconomic challenges related to the slowdown of the global economy.  That trend impacts us predominantly in the amount our clients spend with us for professional services.  We expect this trend to continue through the end of 2016. 
    
  The SunGard acquisition broadened our solution portfolio, enabling us to expand beyond our traditional banking and payments markets into the institutional and wholesale side of financial institutions as well as other buy-side organizations.  It significantly expanded our existing solutions and client base in wealth management, treasury and corporate payments.  These solutions are in demand among our regional and community financial institution clients as they look for ways to replace highly regulated fee revenues.   The combination also favorably impacts our revenue mix, with a greater concentration of license revenues and higher margin services.  Our revenues for the first nine months of 2016 included a $177 million reduction of revenue as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment to reduce SunGard's deferred revenue to fair value.  Similar reductions will be experienced throughout 2016 as the acquired deferred revenue balance runs off.  Amortization of intangible assets acquired in the SunGard acquisition increased our cost of revenues by $352 million for the first nine months of 2016.  Amortization charges will continue to be recorded at varying rates through 2025.  As we integrate SunGard into our existing operations, we anticipate significant cost savings in administration and technology expenses, with a goal of achieving annual synergy run-rate savings of $200 million by the end of 2017.  Certain one-time severance and other costs have been and will be incurred related to delivering these run-rate savings.

     Table of Contents  

We are actively migrating a number of our financial institution clients to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and rapidly address increasing regulatory requirements.  As a provider of outsourcing solutions, we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams, which help moderate the effects of broader year-to-year economic and market changes that otherwise might have a larger impact on our results of operations.  We believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are well-positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve. 
    
  A realignment of resources in our GFS segment resulted in severance costs of $45 million in the first quarter of 2015.    The     realignment activities were a combination of optimizing on-shore and off-shore resources as well as the removal of overlapping management resources.  
    
  Consumer preference continues to shift from traditional branch banking services to digital banking solutions, and our clients seek to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch, mobile, internet and voice-banking channels.  We are focused on enabling our clients to deliver this experience to their customers through our integrated solutions and services.  We continue to develop and invest in these integrated solutions and services to assist clients as they address this market demand.   
  We continue to see demand for innovative solutions in the payments market that will deliver faster, more convenient payment solutions in mobile channels, internet applications and cards.  We believe mobile payments will grow and partially replace existing payment tender volumes over time as consumers and merchants embrace the convenience, incremental services and benefits.  Mobile payment volume is growing significantly but does not yet represent a meaningful amount of the payments market.  Additionally, new formidable non-traditional payments competitors and large merchants are investing in and innovating mobile payment technologies to address the emerging market opportunity, and it is unclear the extent to which particular technologies or services will succeed.  We believe the growth of mobile payments continues to present both an opportunity and a risk to us as the market develops.  Although we cannot predict which mobile payment technologies or solutions will be successful, we cautiously believe our client relationships, payments infrastructure and experience, adapted solutions and emerging solutions are well-positioned to maintain or grow our clients' existing payment volumes, which is our focus.  
  High profile North American merchant payment card information security breaches have pushed the payment card industry towards Europay, MasterCard and VISA ("EMV") integrated circuit cards as financial institutions, card networks and merchants seek to improve information security and reduce fraud costs.  We have invested in our card management solutions and card manufacturing and processing capabilities to accommodate EMV integrated circuit cards so we can guide our clients through this technology transition and grow our card-driven businesses.  We believe the trend to migrate to EMV cards will continue through the rest of 2016. 
    
  The use of checks continues to decline as a percentage of total payments, which negatively impacts our check warranty and item-processing businesses, and we expect this trend to continue.  In 2015 and through the first nine months of 2016, we observed a modest slowdown in our check volume decline and to date have been able to successfully mitigate the majority of the impacts of this decline through cost and fraud efficiency actions and new market solutions, which remain our continued focus. 
  We anticipate consolidation within the banking industry will continue, primarily in the form of merger and acquisition activity, which we believe as a whole is detrimental to our business.  However, consolidation resulting from specific merger and acquisition transactions may be beneficial to our business. When consolidations of financial institutions occur, merger partners often operate systems licensed from competing service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core and payments systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by their expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose revenue if we are providing services to both entities, or if a client of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. It is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting from consolidation may have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide.  We seek to mitigate the risks of consolidations by offering other competitive services to take advantage of specific opportunities at the surviving company.  
    
  Notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions, our international business continued to experience growth across all major regions, including Europe and Asia, on a constant currency basis during the first nine months of 2016.  By comparison with FIS, a greater percentage of SunGard's revenues have been concentrated historically in international markets, which has contributed to this growth trend.  Demand for our solutions will also continue to be driven in developing countries by government-led financial inclusion policies aimed to reduce the unbanked population and by growth in the middle classes in  
  
    22 

     Table of Contents  

these markets driving the need for more sophisticated banking solutions.  The majority of our European revenue is generated by clients in the United Kingdom, France and Germany.  In 2015, we experienced adverse currency impacts in our international businesses as a consequence of a relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar.  
    
  Globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication. This is a trend we expect to continue. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities.  The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupting operations, causing denial of service events, corrupting data, and stealing non-public information.  These circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for FIS.  As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data.  We also operate payment, cash access and prepaid card systems.  
    
  FIS remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems.  This includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services.  We also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients.  Through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement, we have developed fraud, security, risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry.

Processing and Services Revenues 
    
  Processing and services revenues totaled   $2,309 million   and   $1,579 million   during the three-month periods and   $6,795 million   and   $4,721 million   during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Processing and services revenues for the three-month and nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   included approximately $16 million and $80 million, respectively of unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily resulting from a stronger U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound Sterling and during the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , the Brazilian Real. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact, revenue increases for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared

to   2015   were primarily attributable to incremental revenues from the SunGard acquisition, growth in debit payments and card production activities associated with the roll-out of EMV across the industry,  growth in output solutions, and demand for risk and compliance solutions. Our revenues included a $37 million and $177 million reduction of revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment to reduce SunGard acquired deferred revenue to fair value. See "Segment Results of Operations (Unaudited)" under Item 2 of this Quarterly Report     for more detailed explanation.  
    
  Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit 
    
  Cost of revenues totaled   $1,527 million   and   $1,022 million   during the three-month periods and   $4,680 million   and   $3,162 million   during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, resulting in gross profit of   $782 million   and   $557 million   during the respective three-month periods and   $2,115 million   and   $1,559 million   during the nine-month periods.  Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was   33.9%    and   35.3%   during the three-month periods and   31.1%   and   33.0%   during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The change in gross profit during the   2016   period as compared to   2015   primarily resulted from the revenue variances noted above.  The gross profit percentages during the three-months and nine-months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the    2015   periods were negatively impacted by higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the SunGard acquisition.  This negative impact was partially offset by the addition of higher margin revenues from SunGard as well as on-going operating leverage in key markets outside of North America. 
    
  Selling  ,   General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled   $384 million   and   $219 million   during the three-month periods and   $1,250 million   and   $719 million   during the nine-month peiods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The year-over-year increases primarily resulted from incremental expenses from SunGard, including integration and severance.  
    
  Operating Income 
    
  Operating income totaled   $398 million   and   $338 million   during the three-month periods and   $865 million   and   $840 million   during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Operating income as a percentage of revenue ( operating margin ) was   17.2%   and   21.4%   during the three-month periods and   12.7%   and   17.8%   during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The changes in operating income for the three and nine-month periods of   2016   as compared to   2015   resulted from the variances addressed above.  The decrease in operating margin resulted primarily from higher acquired intangible asset amortization expense and other incremental integration and severance costs. 
    
  Total Other Income (Expense), Net 
    
  Total other income (expense), net was   $(104) million   and   $(56) million   during the three-month periods and   $(292) million   and   $21 million   during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest expense, net increased   $62 million   during the three-month period and   $175 million   during the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to   2015   primarily due to higher outstanding debt associated with financing the SunGard acquisition.  During the second quarter of 2015, we sold certain assets associated with our gaming industry check warranty business, resulting in proceeds of $238 million and a pre-tax gain of   $139 million  , which is included in Other income (expense), net during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense from continuing operations totaled   $103 million   and   $100 million   during the three-month periods and   $200 million   and   $314 million   during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , resulting in effective tax rates from continuing operations of   35%   and   36%   for the three month periods and   35%   and   36%   for the nine month periods, respectively.  The effective tax rate during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   included a $90.1 million write-off of goodwill with no tax basis in connection with the sale of our gaming industry check warranty business. 
    
  Earnings from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax, Attributable to FIS Common Stockholders 
    
  Earnings from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to FIS common stockholders totaled   $185 million   and   $177 million   resulting in earnings per diluted share of   $0.56   and   $0.62   for the three-month periods and   $360 million   and   $533 million   resulting in earnings per diluted share of    $1.09   and   $1.87   for the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and

2015  , respectively.   These results reflect the variances described above as well as the increase in shares outstanding from the SunGard acquisition. 

Segment Results of Operations (Unaudited) 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income tax provision (benefit) and depreciation and amortization, including amortization of purchased intangibles), plus certain non-operating items.  This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting.  The non-operating items affecting the segment profit measure generally include acquisition accounting adjustments, acquisition, integration and severance costs, and restructuring expenses.  For consolidated reporting purposes, these costs and adjustments are recorded in the Corporate and Other segment for the periods discussed below.  Adjusted EBITDA for the respective segments excludes the foregoing costs and adjustments.  Financial information, including details of our adjustments to EBITDA, for each of our segments is set forth in Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited) included in Part I of this Quarterly Report.

  Corporate and Other 
  (in millions) 

The Corporate and Other segment results consist of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the reportable segments.  Corporate and Other also includes operations from non-strategic businesses, including commercial services, public sector and education, and check processing.   
    
  Three months ended September 30: 
    
  Processing and services revenues increased   $21 million  , or   21.9%  , despite a $37 million purchase accounting impact on deferred revenue (all of which was recorded as a contra-revenue item in the Corporate and Other segment). Excluding the purchase accounting impact, the revenue increase compared to the 2015 period was primarily attributable to incremental revenues from the SunGard acquisition. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA decreased   $18 million  , or   112.5%  , primarily resulting from the revenue variances noted above and incremental expenses from the SunGard acquisition. 
    
  Nine months ended September 30: 
    
  Processing and services revenues decreased   $30 million  , or   9.6%  , including a $177 million purchase accounting impact on deferred revenue (all of which was recorded as a contra-revenue item in the Corporate and Other segment). Excluding the purchase accounting impact, revenue increased $147 million, or 47.2%, primarily attributable to incremental revenues from the SunGard acquisition contributing 62.3%, partially offset by the divestiture of our check gaming business in the second quarter of 2015 contributing -5.5%. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA losses increased   $38 million  , or   50.0%  , primarily resulting from acquisition, integration, and severance related costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash Requirements 
    
  Our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses, income taxes, mandatory debt service payments, capital expenditures, stockholder dividends, working capital and timing differences in settlement-related assets and liabilities, and may include discretionary debt payments, share repurchases and business acquisitions.  Our principal sources of funds are cash generated by operations and borrowings, including the capacity under our Revolving Loan described in Note 7 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).   
  As of    September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $701 million   and long-term debt of   $10.8 billion  , including the current portion, net of capitalized debt issuance costs. Of the   $701 million   cash and cash equivalents, approximately   $508 million   is held by our foreign entities and would generally be subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the U.S.  The majority of our U.S. cash and cash equivalents represents net deposits-in-transit at the balance sheet dates and relates to daily settlement activity.  We expect that cash and cash equivalents plus cash flows from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements, capital expenditures and mandatory debt service.   
   We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends.  However, the amount, declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions.  Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements.  A regular quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share was paid on September 30, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016.  
  Cash Flows from Operations 
  Cash flows from operations were   $1,342 million   and   $698 million   during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Our net cash provided by operating activities consist primarily of net earnings, adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization.  Cash flows from operations were   $644 million   higher in the   2016   period primarily due to increased cash flow provided by the SunGard acquisition.  
    
  Capital Expenditures and Other Investing Activities 
    
  Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. We invested approximately   $446 million   and   $306 million   in capital expenditures (excluding capital leases) during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increased investment reflects the addition of SunGard to our operations.  
    
  Financing 
    
  In August the Company completed a debt refinancing that increased liquidity, extended tenor of the debt and locked in attractive interest rates.  For more information regarding the Company s long-term debt and financing activity, see Note 7 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).  There were no share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $300 million in the comparable 2015 period. 
     
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  There were no material changes in our contractual obligations during the first nine months of 2016 in comparison to the table included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on February 26, 2016, except as disclosed in Note 7 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance    
  
    28 

     Table of Contents  

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-05 ( ASU 2015-05 ),  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40):   Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.   This guidance was designed to help entities evaluate whether fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement include a software license to internal-use software or whether the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract.   The amendments also supersede paragraph 350-40-25-16, which provided that an entity should analogize to operating lease guidance in accounting for some software licenses (that is, even when an entity obtained a software license, it accounted for the arrangement as executory in nature or as a prepaid vs. a capital asset).  As a result of the amendments, all software licenses in the scope of Subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for in the same manner, consistent with the accounting for other licenses of intangible assets.  The guidance was effective January 1, 2016, and we have elected to apply it prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date.  Through September 30, 2016, the new guidance has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.   However, we do expect the amendment superseding the analogy to lease accounting to result in higher capitalization of fees paid to vendors or commitments under vendor arrangements, and as a result, higher amortization expense versus the classification as subscription service expense under the previous guidance.         
    
  Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 amends substantially all authoritative literature for revenue recognition, including industry-specific requirements, and converges the guidance under this topic with that of the International Financial Reporting Standards. The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other provisions include ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The effective date to the amendments was postponed to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption allowed for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Entities can transition to the standard either with retrospective application to the earlier years presented in their financial statements or with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and subsequent related updates will have on our financial position and results of operations as well as the transition method we expect to employ. 
    
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ).  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of leases with a term of twelve months or less) at the commencement date:  (a) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (b) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.  Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. The pronouncement requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expire before the earliest comparative period presented.  A full retrospective transition approach is not permitted.  Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application is permitted.  We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 and subsequent related updates will have on our financial position and results of operations. 
    
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ),  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.     The amendments are intended to simplify and improve the accounting for employee share-based payments.  Under the new guidance, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies over/under compensation expense recognized will be reflected in the income statement as they occur. This will replace the current guidance, which requires tax benefits that exceed compensation expense (windfalls) to be recognized in equity.  It will also eliminate the need to maintain a  windfall pool,  and will remove the requirement to delay recognizing a windfall until it reduces current taxes payable.  The new guidance will also change the cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits, classifying them as operating inflows, consistent with other cash flows related to income taxes.   Under current guidance, windfalls are classified as financing activities.  These changes may result in more volatile net earnings.   Similarly, effective tax rates will be subject to more variability since the new guidance reflects all tax benefit excesses and deficiencies in tax expense. Under current practice, stock compensation generally does not impact the effective tax rate since any difference between compensation expense and the ultimate tax deduction is reflected in additional paid in capital. Also under the new guidance, excess tax benefits will no longer be included in assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing diluted earnings per share since they will no longer be recognized in additional paid in capital.

     Table of Contents  

Consequently, the reduction to common stock equivalents for assumed purchases from proceeds will be lower and the impact of common stock equivalents will be more dilutive.  For public companies, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.   Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period.       We expect to adopt the ASU in January 2017.  During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $29 million, $40 million and $40 million, respectively, to consolidated equity as excess tax benefits from our stock plans.     
    
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 ( ASU 2016-13 ),  Financial Instrument - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements on Credit Losses of Financial Instruments.  These amendments primary objectives are to implement new methodology for calculating credit losses on financial instruments (e.g., trade receivables) based on expected credit losses and broadens the types of information companies must use when calculating the estimated losses. Under current guidance, the credit losses are calculated based on multiple credit impairment objectives and recognition is delayed until the loss is probable to occur. Under the new guidance, financial assets measured at amortized cost basis must now be shown as the net amount expected to be collected. The credit loss allowance is a contra-valuation account. Available-for-sale securities should continue to be recognized in a similar manner to current GAAP; however, the allowance should be presented as an allowance instead of a write-down of the basis of the asset. For public companies that are SEC filers, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2018.  We do not plan to early adopt and expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statement presentation, financial position, or results of operations. 
    
  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ),  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The amendments are meant to reduce the diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 provides guidance as to the presentation on the statement of cash flows for eight specific cash flow issues, which are 1) debt prepayment for debt extinguishment costs, 2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, 3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, 4) proceeds for the settlement of insurance claims, 5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, 6) distributions received from equity method investees, 7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and 8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. For public companies, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period.  We do not plan to early adopt and expect that the new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statement presentation. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks 
    
  Market Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations.  We are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps. 
     
  The senior notes as described in Note 7 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) represent substantially all of our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations as of    September 30, 2016  .  The carrying value of the senior notes was   $9,950 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The fair value of the senior notes was approximately   $10,475 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Our floating rate long-term debt obligations principally relate to borrowings under the FIS Credit Agreements (as defined in Note 7 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)).   An increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would increase our annual debt service under the FIS Credit Agreements, after we include the impact of our interest rate swaps, by less than   $1 million   (based on principal amounts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  ). We performed the foregoing sensitivity analysis based on the principal amount of our floating rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  , less the  
  
    30 

     Table of Contents  

principal amount of such debt that was then subject to an interest rate swap converting such debt into fixed rate debt. This sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of   September 30, 2016  , and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps in respect of our debt. Further, in this sensitivity analysis, the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year. For comparison purposes, based on principal amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2015  , and calculated in the same manner as set forth above, an increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rate would have increased our annual interest expense, after we calculate the impact of our interest rate swaps, by   $16 million  .  
    
  We use interest rate swaps for the purpose of managing our interest expense through the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt.   See Note 8 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for the listing of interest rate swap transactions we have entered into as of   September 30, 2016  , converting a portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed. 
    
  We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term and Revolving Loans. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are Level 2-type measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps.   
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
    
  We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations.  These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency.  Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward contracts.  Contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.   
    
  Our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks generally arises from our non-U.S. operations, to the extent they are conducted in local currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated approximately   $480 million   and   $1,370 million  , respectively, in revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The major currencies to which our revenues are exposed are the Brazilian Real, the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Indian Rupee.  A 10% move in average exchange rates for these currencies (assuming a simultaneous and immediate 10% change in all of such rates for the relevant period) would have resulted in the following increase or (decrease) in our reported revenues for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions): 

While our results of operations have been impacted by the effects of currency fluctuations, our international operations' revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency, which reduces our economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions.   
    
   Revenues included $16 million and $80 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, resulting from a stronger U.S. Dollar during   2016   as compared to   2015  .  Net earnings      included $4 million  and $8 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.

Our foreign exchange risk management policy permits the use of derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and options, to reduce volatility in our results of operations and/or cash flows resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes or to engage in speculative activity.  We do periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the notional amount of these derivatives was   $121 million   and the fair value was nominal. These derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 
    
  We also use currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in costs caused by variations in Indian Rupee ( INR ) exchange rates.  As of September 30, 2016, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately $14 million and the fair value was nominal.  These INR forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The fair value of these currency forward contracts is determined using currency exchange market rates, obtained from reliable, independent, third party banks, at the balance sheet date. The fair value of forward contracts is subject to changes in currency exchange rates. The Company has no ineffectiveness related to its use of currency forward contracts in connection with INR cash flow hedges. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (a) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms; and (b) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  We completed the SunGard acquisition on November 30, 2015.  As indicated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,  we were not able to complete a review of the internal controls of the acquired business by year end due to the limited time available following the SunGard acquisition.  As permitted by related SEC staff interpretive guidance, we excluded the acquired business from our 2015 annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.   During 2016, we are continuing the transition of SunGard to our accounting and reporting processes and the integration of their systems and processes into our framework of internal controls over financial reporting.   These actions will result in changes in our processes and controls, and our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting including such changes will be concluded by the end of 2016.      
    
  There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 EXHIBIT 10.1

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10.1 
  SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND RELEASE 
  In consideration for the mutual promises in this Severance Agreement and Release (this    Agreement   ),   Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.   (together with its successors and assigns,    FIS    or the    Company   ), on behalf of itself and each of its affiliates,   and   Frank R. Martire   (   Employee    and, together with the Company, a    Party   ) agree as follows.  This Agreement is intended to amend and acknowledge performance of the Employment Agreement between the Parties dated March 31, 2009, as amended on December 1, 2009, March 12, 2012, January 1, 2015, and February 23, 2016 (the    Employment Agreement   ).   
  1.  Termination of Employment  .  On December 31, 2016 (the    Termination Date   ), Employee s employment with the Company as Executive Chairman of the FIS Board of Directors (the    Board   ) will terminate without further action of the Parties.  This termination will be treated as a Termination by the Company for a Reason Other than Cause, Death or Disability for purposes of the Employment Agreement.  Employee and Company hereby waive any notice of termination that might otherwise be required under in the Employment Agreement or otherwise.   
  2.        Severance Benefits  .  Following the Termination Date, the Company will pay/provide Employee the following amounts and benefits which, together, shall be considered the    Severance Benefits  .   Employee agrees that timely provision of the Severance Benefits will satisfy all of the Company s obligations to him under the Employment Agreement, and, upon payment/provision of the Severance Benefits, Employee will have received all payments or benefits to which he is entitled under the Employment Agreement.  The Company and its affiliates may withhold from any amount or benefit payable under this Agreement or any other Company Arrangement taxes that they are required to withhold pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.  The benefits described in clause (f) will be subject to Section 23 below. 
  (a)        On or before January 15, 2017, the Company will pay Employee any unpaid salary due for service through the Termination Date. 
  (b)        On or before March 15, 2017, the Company will pay Employee the Annual Bonus earned by him for 2016, the amount of such bonus to be determined based solely upon the degree to which the 2016 performance objectives previously established by the Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors are attained (and thus without the exercise of any negative discretion), and to be paid entirely in cash. 
  (c)        On or about June 30, 2017, the Company will pay Employee a gross lump sum cash amount of $7,200,000, which is equal to three times the sum of Employee s Annual Base Salary for 2016 ($800,000) and Employee s target Annual Bonus for 2016 ($1,600,000).     
  (d)        On or about June 30, 2017, the Company will pay Employee a gross lump sum cash amount of $170,640, which is equal to thirty-six times the monthly life insurance premiums that would be due if Employee ported his Company life insurance coverage in effect on the Termination Date.  
  (e)        On the Termination Date, Employee will become fully vested in all outstanding, unvested equity grants made to him prior to the Termination Date, without regard to the degree to which any applicable performance objectives have been, or are later, attained.  As of the Termination Date, all of Employee s outstanding equity awards will be wholly non-forfeitable, and each of Employee s outstanding stock options will be and remain exercisable until the earlier of the third anniversary of the Termination Date and the expiration of the option s maximum stated term. 
  (f)        Employee will, in addition, be entitled to timely provision of any other or additional benefits to which he is then, or thereafter becomes, entitled under the then applicable terms of any applicable plan, program, agreement, corporate governance document or arrangement of the Company or any of its affiliates (collectively,    Company Arrangements   ) (e.g., reimbursement of business expenses, pay-out of unused vacation and personal days, 401k plan payouts, indemnification benefits, SunGard Synergy Bonus payments, etc.). 
  3.        Employee agrees that the Severance Benefits include payments and benefits to which he would not otherwise be entitled.  Subject to the payment/provision of the Severance Benefits, Employee affirms that he has been paid and/or has received all compensation, wages, bonuses, leaves, commissions and/or benefits to which Employee is entitled by virtue of his Employment Agreement. Concurrently with entering into this Agreement, the Parties will enter into an agreement entitled  Agreement to Serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors  in the form attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement (the    Chairman Agreement   ).  Based on consideration provided in the Chairman Agreement, Employee expressly waives any right to the lump sum COBRA subsidy provided for in Section 9(a)(v)(b) of the Employment Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary, amounts and benefits provided under this Agreement will be wholly non-forfeitable, except as required by law or under the Clawback Policy adopted by the Board s Compensation Committee in December 2010. 
  4.        The    Effective Date    of this Agreement shall be the later of the Termination Date and the eighth (8   th   ) day after Employee has executed and returned this Agreement to the Company. 
  5.        Employee, on Employee s own behalf and on behalf of Employee s agents, assigns, heirs, executors, and administrators (collectively,    Employee Releasors   ), hereby waives, and releases and discharges the Company, its affiliates, and its and their owners, stockholders, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, successors and assigns (collectively,    Company Released Parties   ) from, any claim, demand, action, or cause of action, known or unknown, (collectively,    Claims   ) that any Employee Releasor may have against any Company Released Party and that arose at any time up to the date Employee signs this Agreement, including, without limitation, any such Claim relating to, arising out of, or in any way connected with Employee s employment with the Company or the ending of that employment, including, without limitation, any claim, demand, action, cause of action or right based on but not limited to: the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C.    12101,   et     seq  .; Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended, (42 U.S.C.    1981, 1981A and 1988);  the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C.    2601,   et seq  ., and any state or local family and medical leave laws, which require employers to provide leaves of absence under certain circumstances; Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C.    2000e,   et seq  .; the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002; the Equal Pay Act; the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification  (   WARN   ) Act, and any state or local law that requires advance notice be given of certain work force reductions; the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (   USERRA    the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C.    1001,   et     seq.  ; the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act; any and all civil rights acts of any state including any state or local employment discrimination law and any state or local law that regulates employment or restricts an employer s right to terminate employees; any state or local wage law, statute or ordinance; any claim of discrimination, harassment or retaliation; any existing employment agreement or potential entitlement under any Company program or plan including any claim to any bonus or commission; any claim for severance pay or for reimbursement of expenses; any duty or other employment-related obligation arising under the law of contract, tort or from any other type of statute, law or public policy (collectively,    Released Claims   ).  Excluded from the release in this Section 5, and thus from the Released Claims, is any Claim arising under or preserved by this Agreement; any Claim as an investor, creditor, or shareholder of the Company or any of its affiliates; any Claim for indemnification, advancement, or liability insurance coverage; and any Claim against any Company Released Party, other than the Company and its affiliates, that does not arise out of or relate to Employee s employment with, or services for, the Company or its affiliates, or any termination thereof.    This is intended to be as complete a waiver as possible of all Claims against any of the Company Released Parties to the extent set forth herein.  This waiver is effective only as to those Claims that may properly be waived in this manner. 
  Nothing in this Agreement or elsewhere shall be construed to prevent Employee from filing a charge or complaint, including a challenge to the validity of this Agreement, with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any similar state or local agency, or from participating in or cooperating with any investigation conducted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or similar agency.  Employee waives the right to monetary damages or other individual legal or equitable relief awarded in relation to any such charge against the Company.   
  6.        With respect to Released Claims, Employee waives the right to money damages or other legal or equitable relief awarded by a governmental agency or court related to any claim filed against the Company or any Company Released Party.  Employee further agrees, with respect to Released Claims, to withdraw any charge or claim for damages that have or may have been filed before any local, state or federal agency relating in any way to the Company or a Company Released Party, except as to any claim for unemployment compensation, workers  compensation or other related benefits.  Nothing in this Agreement seeks to waive Employee s rights to bring claims for unemployment compensation, claims for workers  compensation benefits, or claims pursuant to any insurance or benefits plan. 
  7.        In the event that any Employee Releasor brings any Released Claim against any Company Released Party, Employee shall fully and promptly indemnify such Company Released Party against any cost, expense or liability incurred by such Company Released Party in connection with such Released Claim, such indemnity to include without limitation prompt advancement of any legal fees or other expenses incurred by such Company Released Party in connection with such Released Claim. 
  8.        The Company, on the Company s own behalf and on behalf of each of the other Company Released Parties, hereby waives, releases and discharges each of the Employee Releasors, and their attorneys, agents, successors and assigns, from any Claim that any Company Released Party may have against any Employee Releasor and that arose at any time up to the date that the Company signs this Agreement.  Excluded from this Release is any Claim arising under or preserved by this Agreement; any Claim arising under any Company Arrangement; and any Claim by any Company Released Party other than the Company and its affiliates that does not arise out of or relate to Employee s employment with, or services for, the Company or its affiliates, or any termination thereof.  In the event that any Company Released Party brings any Claim that is released under this Section 8 against any Employee Releasor, the Company shall fully and promptly indemnify such Employee Releasor against such Claim, such indemnity to include without limitation prompt advancement of any legal fees or other expenses incurred by such Employee Releasor in connection with such Claim. 
  9.        The restrictions set forth in Sections 12, 13(b), 14 and 15 of the Employment Agreement shall continue to apply to Employee after the Termination Date in accordance with their terms, provided, however, that for this purpose the last sentence of Section 13(b) of the Employment Agreement (relating to waiving the one-year restricted period in the event of a termination without Cause) shall be disregarded, with the result that the restrictions in Section 13(b) of the Employment Agreement shall continue to apply until the first anniversary of the Termination Date before lapsing.  There shall be no contractual or similar restriction on Employee s post-employment activities (including without limitation restrictions enforceable through loss of benefits to which Employee might otherwise be entitled) other than those specified in this Section 9. 
  10.        The Company shall at all times, through at least the sixth anniversary of the date that Employee s service as a member of the Board terminates, maintain director and officer liability insurance coverage for Employee s benefit in a form at least as comprehensive as, and in an amount that is at least equal to, the coverage then maintained for any other present or former officer or director of the Company.  In addition, as provided in Article V of the Company s charter and Article Five of the Company s bylaws, Employee shall be indemnified by the Company against any cost, expense, liability or loss incurred or suffered by him in connection with any Claim, discovery request, or request for testimony or information, that is raised or threatened against him, or that is reasonably anticipated to be raised against him, and that arises out of or relates to his service for the Company or any of its affiliates, such indemnification to include prompt advancement of expenses (including without limitation attorney s fees), in each case to the fullest extent permitted under the Company s bylaws  as of the Effective Date. 
  11.        In the event of Employee s death or a judicial determination of his incompetence, references to Employee in this Agreement shall (where appropriate) be deemed to refer to his heir(s), beneficiar(ies), estate, executor(s) or other legal representative(s).  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary, Employee shall at all times be entitled to: (a) retain, and use appropriately, (i) documents and information relating to his personal entitlements and obligations, and (ii) his rolodex (and electronic equivalents); (b) disclose documents and information in confidence to an attorney or other professional for the purpose of securing professional advice; and (c) make truthful statements, and disclose documents and information, (i) when required by law, subpoena, court order or the like, (ii) when requested by any governmental or self-regulatory authority, (iii) when protected by applicable  whistleblower  statutes, or (iv) as reasonably necessary to enforce his rights in a proceeding under Section 14 or otherwise.  Employee shall be under no obligation to seek other employment or otherwise mitigate the obligations of the Company or any of its affiliates under this Agreement or otherwise, and there shall be no offset against amounts or benefits due Employee under this Agreement or otherwise on account of (x) any Claim that the Company or any of its affiliates may have against him or (y) any remuneration or other benefit earned or received by Employee after the Termination Date.  Any amounts due to Employee under this Agreement are considered to be reasonable by the Company and are not in the nature of a penalty.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement or the Chairman Agreement and the terms of any other Company Arrangement, the terms of this Agreement and the Chairman Agreement shall control.  Sections 10 and 23 of the Employment Agreement (relating respectively to certain excise taxes and to attorneys  fees) shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement as if set forth verbatim in it.  The Company shall promptly pay, or reimburse Employee for, any legal fees and expenses that he reasonably incurs in connection with entering into the arrangements set forth in this Agreement and in its Exhibit. 
  12.        This Agreement sets forth the complete agreement between the Parties relating to the compensation, wages, bonuses, leaves, commissions, and/or benefits to which Employee is entitled under the Employment Agreement.       
  13.        Any terms utilized in this Agreement and not defined herein have the meaning given to them by the Employment Agreement. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, in signing this Agreement, such Party does not rely and has not relied upon any representations or statements by the other Party or its/his representative with regard to the subject matter, basis, or effect of this Agreement that are not specifically reflected in this Agreement.   
  14.        This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed, governed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, regardless of its place of execution or performance, without regard to internal principles relating to conflict of laws.
