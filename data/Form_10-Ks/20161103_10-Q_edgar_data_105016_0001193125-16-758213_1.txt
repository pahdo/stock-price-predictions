   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 September 30, 2016    (In
thousands, except share and per share data)     1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
  Basis of Consolidation     Watsco, Inc. (collectively with
its consolidated subsidiaries,  Watsco,   we,   us  or  our ) was incorporated in Florida in 1956 and is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and
supplies ( HVAC/R ) in the HVAC/R distribution industry in North America. The accompanying September 30, 2016 interim condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or
omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, but we believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements included herein. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of
Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation ( Carrier ), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.    The results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably
or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for
heating equipment is usually highest in the fourth quarter. Demand related to the new construction market is fairly consistent during the year, subject to weather and economic conditions, including their effect on the number of housing completions.
    Use of Estimates     The preparation of condensed
consolidated unaudited financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Significant estimates include valuation reserves for accounts receivable, inventories and income taxes, reserves
related to self-insurance programs and the valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. While we believe that these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from such estimates.  
  New Accounting Standards      Revenue Recognition   
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive
revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The core principle is that a company will
recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of this standard by one
year. As a result, this standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We will adopt this guidance
on January 1, 2018, and are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements.     Measurement of Inventory   
 In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the measurement of inventory by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net
realizable value test. The guidance applies to all inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out or average cost methods. This guidance must be applied prospectively and will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
      7  

Table of Contents  

   Leases     In
February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding
the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases and will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective
approach. We are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.     Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   
 In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that will require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as
a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, rather than as an asset. This guidance is effective retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not
have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.     Share-Based Payments   
 In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance related to employee share-based payment accounting. The guidance requires that all income tax effects of awards
to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance also requires presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. The guidance
increases the amount companies can withhold to cover income taxes on awards without triggering liability classification for shares used to satisfy statutory income tax withholding obligations and requires application of a modified retrospective
transition method. The amended guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted if all provisions are adopted in the same period.  
 We elected to early adopt the amended guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which required us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the
beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in 2016. We elected
to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits prospectively. The accounting for income taxes and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016, where
the cumulative effect of these changes are required to be recorded. We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.  
 Adoption of the amended guidance resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital of $591 and
$2,898 for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and impacted our previously reported quarterly results for March 31, 2016 as follows:

   2. EARNINGS PER SHARE   
 The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for our Common and Class B common stock:  
   
   Diluted earnings per share for our Common stock assumes the conversion of all of our Class B common stock into Common stock as
of the beginning of the fiscal year; therefore, no allocation of earnings to Class B common stock is required. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, our outstanding Class B common stock was convertible into 2,716,320 and 2,724,464 shares of our
Common stock, respectively.

   3. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME   
 Other comprehensive (loss) income consists of the foreign currency translation adjustment associated with our Canadian operations  use of the Canadian
dollar as its functional currency and changes in the unrealized (losses) gains on cash flow hedging instruments and available-for-sale securities. The tax effects allocated to each component of other comprehensive (loss) income were as follows:  
   
   The changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows:

   4. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
 We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset the earnings impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations would otherwise have had on certain
monetary liabilities that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.     Cash Flow Hedging Instruments   
 We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from
accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement occurs. The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months. Accordingly, at September 30, 2016, all of our open foreign
currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at September 30, 2016 was $22,600, and such contracts have varying terms expiring
through March 2017.    The impact from foreign exchange derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was as follows for the periods indicated:  
   
   At September 30, 2016, we expected an estimated $11 of pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed
prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.     Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments   
 We have also entered into foreign currency forward contracts that are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivative
instruments were effective economic hedges for all of the periods presented. The fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. The notional value of our
foreign currency exchange contract not designated as a hedging instrument at September 30, 2016 was $2,900, and such contract expired in October 2016.  
 We recognized gains of $75 and $955 from foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited
statements of income for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognized a (loss) gain of $(389) and $2,249 from foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated
unaudited statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    The following table summarizes the fair value of
derivative instruments, which consist solely of foreign currency forward contracts, included in other current assets in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets. See Note 5.

The following is a description of the valuation techniques used for these assets and liabilities, as well as the level of
input used to measure fair value:     Available-for-sale securities    these investments are exchange-traded equity securities. Fair values for
these investments are based on closing stock prices from active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  
  Derivative financial instruments    these derivatives are foreign currency forward contracts. See Note 4. Fair value is based on observable market
inputs, such as forward rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.    There were no
transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     6. SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY   
  Common Stock Dividends     We paid cash dividends of $0.85,
$0.70, $2.55 and $2.10 per share of Common stock and Class B common stock during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  Non-Vested Restricted Stock     During the quarters ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we granted 23,803 and 17,500 shares of non-vested restricted stock, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we granted 135,981 and 189,479 shares of non-vested restricted stock,
respectively.        During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, 2,936 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of
$419 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of non-vested restricted stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an aggregate of 30,413 shares of Common and Class B
common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $3,967 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, 7,206
shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $889 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. These shares were retired upon delivery.

   Exercise of Stock Options   
 During the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 23,584 and 14,250 stock options, respectively, were exercised for a combination of Common stock and
Class B common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 58,084 and 80,450 stock options, respectively, were exercised for a combination of Common stock and Class B common stock. Cash received from the exercise of stock
options during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1,834, $999, $4,092 and $3,681, respectively.    During the quarter
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, 348 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $51 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash for stock option exercises and related tax withholdings. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, 14,760 shares of Class B common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $1,837 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash for stock option exercises and related tax withholdings. These shares were retired upon
delivery.         Employee Stock Purchase Plan   
 During the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 2,084 and 2,433 shares of Common stock were issued under our employee stock purchase plan for which
we received net proceeds of $286 and $294, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, 6,915 and 7,402 shares of Common stock were issued under our employee stock purchase plan for which we received net proceeds of
$870 and $847, respectively.     401(k) Plan     During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we issued 20,045 and 18,343 shares of Common stock, respectively, to our profit sharing retirement plan, representing the Common stock discretionary matching contributions of $2,348 and $1,963,
respectively.     Non-controlling Interest     Of our three
joint ventures with Carrier, we have an 80% controlling interest in one and a 60% controlling interest in each of the other two, while Carrier has either a 20% or 40% non-controlling interest in such joint ventures, as applicable. The following
table reconciles shareholders  equity attributable to Carrier s non-controlling interest:      
    7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
  Litigation, Claims and Assessments     In December 2015, a
purported Watsco shareholder, Nelson Gaskins, filed a derivative lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Watsco s Board of Directors. The Company is a nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleges breach of
fiduciary duties regarding CEO incentive compensation and seeks to recover alleged excessive incentive compensation and unspecified damages. The defendants believe the claims are entirely without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them.
While we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, we believe the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  
 We are also involved in other litigation incidental to the operation of our business. We vigorously defend all matters in which we or our subsidiaries are
named defendants and, for insurable losses, maintain significant levels of insurance to protect against adverse judgments, claims or assessments that may affect us. Although the adequacy of existing insurance coverage and the outcome of any legal
proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, based on the current information available, we do not believe the ultimate liability associated with any known claims or litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.     Self-Insurance   
 Self-insurance reserves are maintained relative to company-wide casualty insurance and health benefit programs. The level of exposure from catastrophic events
is limited by the purchase of stop-loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverage. When estimating the self-insurance liabilities and related reserves, management considers a number of factors, which include historical claims experience,
demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. Management reviews its assumptions with its independent third-party actuaries to evaluate whether the self-insurance reserves are adequate. If
 
      13  

Table of Contents  

actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occur and exceed these estimates, additional reserves may be required. Reserves in the amounts of $4,156 and $3,214 at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were established related to such programs and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets.  
  Purchase Obligations     At September 30, 2016, we were
obligated under a non-cancelable purchase order with one of our key suppliers for goods aggregating approximately $44,000.     8. RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS     Purchases from Carrier and its affiliates comprised 62% of all inventory purchases made during both the quarters ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. Purchases from Carrier and its affiliates comprised 62% of all inventory purchases made during both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, approximately $100,000 and
$85,000, respectively, was payable to Carrier and its affiliates, net of receivables. Our joint ventures with Carrier also sell HVAC products to Carrier and its affiliates. Revenues in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for
the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included approximately $17,000, $18,000, $46,000 and $47,000, respectively, of sales to Carrier and its affiliates. We believe these transactions are conducted at arm s-length in
the ordinary course of business.     9. SUBSEQUENT EVENT   
 On October 20, 2016, in connection with the upcoming end of the lease term for our corporate aircraft, we purchased an aircraft for $30,700.

 The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements, including the notes thereto, included
under Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, reference should be made to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.     Company Overview   
 Watsco, Inc. was incorporated in Florida in 1956, and, together with its subsidiaries (collectively,  Watsco,  or  we ,  us  or
 our ) is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies ( HVAC/R ) in the HVAC/R distribution industry in North America. At September 30, 2016, we operated from
568 locations in 37 U.S. States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico with additional market coverage on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean.  
 Revenues primarily consist of sales of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies. Selling, general and
administrative expenses primarily consist of selling expenses, the largest components of which are salaries, commissions and marketing expenses that are variable and correlate to changes in sales. Other significant selling, general and
administrative expenses relate to the operation of warehouse facilities, including a fleet of trucks and forklifts and facility rent, which are payable mostly under non-cancelable operating leases.  
 Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted
favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and
demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the fourth quarter. Demand related to the new construction market is fairly consistent during the year, subject to weather and economic conditions, including their effect on the number of housing
completions.     Joint Ventures with Carrier Corporation   
 In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier Corporation ( Carrier ), which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I. In July 2012, we exercised our
option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased our ownership interest to 70%; and, on July 1, 2014, we exercised our last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier
Enterprise I, which increased our controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I to 80%. Neither Watsco nor Carrier has any remaining options to purchase additional ownership interests in Carrier Enterprise I or any of our other joint ventures with
Carrier, which are described below.    In 2011, we formed a second joint venture with Carrier, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II. We have a 60%
controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and Carrier has a 40% non-controlling interest. In 2012, we formed a third joint venture, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, referred to as UTC Canada, an
affiliate of Carrier. We have a 60% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise III, and UTC Canada has a 40% non-controlling interest.     Critical
Accounting Policies     Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the condensed
consolidated unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and the reported amount of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, management reevaluates its judgments and estimates, which are based on historical
experience, current trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

  Our critical accounting policies are included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on
February 29, 2016. We believe that there have been no significant changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
    New Accounting Standards     Refer to Note 1 to
our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of new accounting standards.  
  Results of Operations     The following table summarizes
information derived from the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income, expressed as a percentage of revenues, for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
   In the following narratives, computations and disclosure information referring to  same-store basis  exclude the
effects of locations acquired or locations opened or closed during the immediately preceding 12 months unless they are within close geographical proximity to existing locations. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, 17 and 35 locations, respectively,
were excluded from  same-store basis  information. The table below summarizes the changes in our locations for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016:      
    Third Quarter of 2016 Compared to Third Quarter of 2015   
  Revenues     Revenues for the third quarter of 2016 increased
$64.2 million, or 5%, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, including $0.4 million from locations opened during the preceding 12 months, offset by $2.9 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $66.7 million, or
6%, as compared to the same period in 2015, reflecting a 7% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (67% of sales), a 2% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and a 7% increase in sales of commercial refrigeration products (5% of
sales). The increase in same-store revenues is primarily due to strong demand for the replacement of residential and commercial HVAC equipment. Revenues from sales of residential HVAC equipment also benefited from an improved sales mix of
higher-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices.

   Gross Profit   
 Gross profit for the third quarter of 2016 increased $16.4 million, or 6%, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of increased
revenues. Gross profit margin for both the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 24.3%.    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
    Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2016 increased $7.7 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased revenues.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 14.7% from 14.9% for the same period in 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses included $0.7 million of
incremental costs for the third quarter of 2016 in excess of the third quarter of 2015 for ongoing technology initiatives. On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% as compared to the same period in 2015. 
  Interest Expense, Net     Interest expense, net, for the
third quarter of 2016 decreased 34% to $1.0 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a higher effective interest rate in 2016, in each case as compared to the same period in 2015.  
  Income Taxes     Income taxes increased to $37.8 million for
the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $34.5 million for the third quarter of 2015 and are a composite of the income taxes attributable to our wholly owned operations and income taxes attributable to the Carrier joint ventures, which are primarily
taxed as partnerships for income tax purposes. The effective income tax rates attributable to us were 36.8% and 36.7% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher tax credits in 2015
versus 2016 related to income generated by our U.S. subsidiaries, which was partially offset by a $0.6 million benefit from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation in 2016. See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated
unaudited financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.     Net Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc.   
 Net income attributable to Watsco for the third quarter of 2016 increased $5.1 million, or 9%, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was
primarily driven by higher revenues and reduced selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, as discussed above.     Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015      Revenues   
 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $97.7 million, or 3%, as compared to the same period in 2015, including $1.4 million from
locations opened during the preceding 12 months, offset by $14.8 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $111.1 million, or 3%, as compared to the same period in 2015, reflecting a 4% increase in sales of HVAC
equipment (66% of sales), a 1% increase in sales of other HVAC products (29% of sales) and a 7% increase in sales of commercial refrigeration products (5% of sales). The increase in same-store revenues is primarily due to demand for the replacement
of residential and commercial HVAC equipment.     Gross Profit   
 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $21.2 million, or 3%, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of
increased revenues. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 declined 10 basis-points to 24.4% versus 24.5% for the same period in 2015, primarily due to lower realized gross margins for residential HVAC equipment. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses     Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $16.2 million, or 3%, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of increased revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percent of revenues for both the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 15.7%. Selling, general and administrative expenses included $3.2 million of incremental costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in excess of the same
period in 2015 for ongoing technology initiatives. On a same-store basis, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 4% as compared to 2015.  
  Interest Expense, Net     Interest expense, net, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $1.5 million, or 33%, primarily as a result of a decrease in average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a higher effective interest rate in 2016, in each case as compared to the same period in
2015.

   Income Taxes   
 Income taxes increased to $88.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $87.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 and are a composite of the income taxes attributable to our wholly owned operations and income taxes attributable to the Carrier joint ventures, which are primarily taxed as partnerships for income tax purposes. The effective income tax rates
attributable to us were 36.0% and 36.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned $2.9 million benefit from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to
share-based compensation. See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.     Net
Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc.     Net income attributable to Watsco for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $6.8 million, or 5%, as
compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues, as discussed above.     Liquidity and Capital Resources
    We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to execute our business strategy and fund operating and investing activities, taking
into consideration the seasonal demand for HVAC/R products, which peaks in the months of May through August. Significant factors that could affect our liquidity include the following:  

cash needed to fund our business (primarily working capital requirements);        

borrowing capacity under our bank line of credit;        

the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms;        

acquisitions, including joint ventures;        

dividend payments;        

capital expenditures; and        

the timing and extent of common stock repurchases.       Sources and Uses of Cash   
 We rely on cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general
corporate purposes, including dividend payments, if and as declared by our Board of Directors, capital expenditures, business acquisitions and development of our long-term operating strategies.  
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $35.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which, $29.0 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The repatriation of
cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to capital controls; however, these balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations of our foreign
subsidiaries.    We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand and funds available for borrowing under our line of credit will be sufficient to
meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that our current sources of available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements.  
 Our access to funds under our line of credit depends on the ability of the syndicate banks to meet their respective funding commitments. Disruptions in the
credit and capital markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our line of credit and may also adversely affect the determination of interest rates, particularly rates based on LIBOR, which is one of the base rates under our line of
credit. Disruptions in the credit and capital markets could also result in increased borrowing costs and/or reduced borrowing capacity under our line of credit.  
  Working Capital     Working capital increased to $990.9
million at September 30, 2016 from $911.0 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories, primarily due to the seasonality of our business.

   Cash Flows   
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):  
   
   The individual items contributing to cash flow changes for the periods presented are detailed in the condensed consolidated
unaudited statements of cash flows contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.     Operating Activities   
 Net cash provided by operating activities was higher primarily due to the timing of payments for accrued expenses in 2016 and lower inventory as a result of
the transition to new regional efficiency standards in 2015.     Investing Activities   
 Net cash used in investing activities was lower due to the purchase of owned space for expansion of our corporate headquarters in 2015.  
  Financing Activities     Net cash used in financing
activities was higher due to increases in repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, dividends paid and distributions to the noncontrolling interest in 2016.  
  Revolving Credit Agreement     We maintain an unsecured,
syndicated revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings of up to $600.0 million. Borrowings are used to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by
our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. The revolving credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $219.4 million and $245.3 million were
outstanding under the revolving credit agreement, respectively. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios,
and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2016.    Acquisitions   
 We continually evaluate potential acquisitions and/or joint ventures and routinely hold discussions with a number of acquisition candidates. Should suitable
acquisition opportunities arise that would require additional financing, we believe our financial position and earnings history provide a sufficient basis for us to either obtain additional debt financing at competitive rates and on reasonable terms
or raise capital through the issuance of equity securities.     Common Stock Dividends   
 We paid cash dividends of $2.55 per share and $2.10 per share of Common stock and Class B common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. On October 3, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share of Common and Class B common stock that was paid on October 31, 2016 to shareholders of record as of October 17,
2016. Future dividends and/or changes in dividend rates will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as cash flow generated by operations, profitability, financial condition, cash requirements, future
prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.     Company Share Repurchase Program   
 In September 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at management s discretion, of up to 7,500,000 shares of common stock in the open
market or via private transactions. Shares repurchased under the program are accounted for using the cost method and result in a reduction of shareholders  equity. No shares were repurchased during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.
In aggregate, 6,370,913 shares of Common and Class B common stock have been repurchased at a cost of $114.4 million since the inception of the program. At September 30, 2016, there were 1,129,087 shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the
program.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
 There have been no material changes to the information regarding market risk provided in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

     ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( the Exchange Act ) that are, among other things, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), Senior Vice President ( SVP ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), to allow for timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings.    Our management, with the participation of our CEO, SVP and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and, based on that evaluation, our CEO, SVP and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level, at
and as of such date.     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 We are continuously seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and of our internal controls. This results in refinements to
processes throughout the Company. However, there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.       PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION        ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
 Information with respect to this item may be found in Note 7 to our condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q under the caption  Litigation, Claims and Assessments,  which information is incorporated by reference in this Item 1 of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
    ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   
 Information about risk factors for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 does not differ materially from that set forth in Part I, Item 1A, of our
