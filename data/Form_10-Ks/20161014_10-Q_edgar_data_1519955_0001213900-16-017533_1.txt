CAUTION
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION   

All
statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q ( Form 10-Q ), other than statements of historical facts,
that address future activities, events or developments are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements
containing the words  believe,   anticipate,   expect  and words of similar import.  These
statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our assessment of historical
trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances.  However,
whether actual results will conform to the expectations and predictions of management is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
that may cause actual results to differ materially.  Such risks may include, among others, the following: national and
local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage or forecast our growth; raw material costs and availability;
new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government
regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting
operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain
qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other factors referenced in this and previous filings.  

Consequently,
all of the forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no
assurance that the actual results anticipated by management will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will
have the expected consequences to or effects on our business operations.

1.             BASIS
OF PRESENTATION   

CEFC
Global Strategic Holdings, Inc., (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 23, 2010, and
its year-end is February 28.  In connection with the change of control which occurred on August 22, 2012, the Company
intends to operate a trading business for oil, fuel and other petroleum products.  In connection with its planned business
operations, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA) Co., Limited ( China Ocean ),
in Hong Kong on October 17, 2012.  However, China Ocean had no operations, assets or liabilities as of August 31, 2016
and February 29, 2016.   

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of CEFC Global Strategic Holdings, Inc., have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ), and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
contained in the Company's Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting
of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the
interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for our interim periods are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements that would substantially duplicate
the disclosure contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2016, as reported in the Form 10-K, have
been omitted.   

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA)
Co., Limited ( China Ocean ). All intercompany transactions, if any, are eliminated upon consolidations.   

Going
Concern    

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has incurred losses since inception
resulting in an accumulated deficit of $286,913 at August 31, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its
business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Its ability to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement of its common stock or further shareholder loans
as needed. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue.  

2.             RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

Shareholder
advances represent advances made to us by our majority shareholder, Sino Ocean Fuel Holdings Limited (formerly known as Formula
One Investments Limited), for working capital purposes amounting to $249,451 at August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016.  These
advances are non-interest bearing, due upon demand and are unsecured.  

Item
2.     Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations    

The
following discussion provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations
and financial condition of our company.  It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying
notes.  

Plan
of Operation   

Our
Company was originally incorporated on September 23, 2010 in the State of Nevada under the name  Astra Ventures, Inc.   On
December 10, 2013, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State which became effective on December 10,
2013, to change our name to  CEFC Global Strategic Holdings, Inc.    We originally planned to commence business
operations by obtaining distribution rights for television programming and specialty films such as reality television and extreme
sports programming for reproduction and distribution across multiple markets and formats in the United States and worldwide.  However,
in connection with the change of control transaction that closed on August 22, 2012 and which is more fully described below under
the section below titled   Our Management ,  we appointed a new executive management team and changed our planned
business operations.  

We
now intend to start operating a trading business, leveraging our executive management s extensive experience in the trading
of oil, fuel and other petroleum products.  On October 17, 2012, we completed the formation of our new wholly owned
subsidiary trading company, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA) Co., Limited ( China Ocean ), in Hong Kong through which we
plan to engage in trading petroleum and petrochemical products.  Our management team is currently engaging in business development
and we plan to commence our trading operations through China Ocean.  Our business office will be located in Hong Kong
and we may also set up sales offices in China in the future.  Our suppliers will be mainly from sources based in the Middle
East and our targeted customers will be buyers from mainland China, Hong Kong and Asia.  We plan to finance our trading business
through bank financings and private loans.  

We
also intend to explore investment opportunities mainly in energy-related projects. We anticipate raising funds for these investments
through public or private equity or debt financings and bank loans.  

We
have not yet started operations or generated or realized any revenues from business operations.  Our auditors have issued
a going concern opinion based on our prior business operations.  This means that there is substantial doubt that we
can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital.  We do not expect
to generate any revenue until we commence operations under our new business plan.  Accordingly, we must raise cash from
other sources.  We currently have no arrangements in place for additional financing.  Our success or failure
will be initially determined by the availability of additional financing and thereafter by our success in implementing our business
plan.  

Our
current cash resources are insufficient to finance our planned expenditures.  To successfully commence our planned operations
we will need to raise additional financing.  We anticipate raising the funds through either private loans, the public
and/or private sale of our common stock or bank financing.  We have no third party financing commitments, and our ability
to raise financing in the equity markets are uncertain as the equity markets, in recent years, have been depressed especially
for start-up companies.  

Our
Management   

On
August 22, 2012, Sino Ocean Fuel Holdings Limited (formerly known as  Formula One Investments Limited ), a British
Virgin Islands company ( Sino Ocean ) acquired in private stock sale transactions an aggregate 4,200,000 shares (the
 Shares ) of the Company s common stock (the  Common Stock ) from Sieg Badke, who prior to the Closing
Date was the majority shareholder and the sole director and executive officer of the Company, and from other former individual
stockholders of the Company, through which Sino Ocean acquired an additional 200,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock.
 Following the closing of these private stock sale transactions and the change in control, Sino Ocean owned an aggregate
4,200,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock, representing 60.87% of the issued and outstanding the Company s Common
Stock as of August 22, 2012 (the  Closing Date ).   In connection with the change of control, effective
upon the Closing Date: (a) Sieg Badke resigned as the Company s sole director, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief
Financial Officer, Treasurer and Vice President; (b) Jesse Hahn resigned as the Company s Secretary; (c) Mao Zhao, was appointed
as the Chief Executive Officer and Director; (d) Chau To Chan was appointed as President and Chairman of the Board of Directors;
(e) Qinzhen Li was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company; and (f) Yong Li was appointed
as a member of the Board of Directors.  

Effective
on March 18, 2014, Ms. Mao Zhao resigned as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s board of directors
appointed Mr. Yadong Liu ( Mr. Liu ) as the Company s new Chief Executive Officer to replace Ms. Zhao. In addition,
Mr. Liu was also appointed as a new member of the Company s board of directors. The Company s board of directors approved
an increase in the authorized number of directors from three to four on March 18, 2014 in conjunction with the appointment of
Mr. Liu as a new member of the board of directors. On May 28, 2014, Ms. Mao Zhao resigned as a member of the Company s board
of directors.  

Results
of Operations   

Three-Month
Periods Ended August 31, 2016 and 2015    

We
did not earn any revenues during the three-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.  

We
incurred operating expenses in the amount of $12,200 for the three-month period ended August 31, 2016 as compared to $24,029 for
the three-month period ended August 31, 2015.  These operating expenses comprised of general and administrative expenses.  

Six-Month
Periods Ended August 31, 2016 and 2015    

We
also did not earn any revenues during the six-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.  

We
incurred operating expenses in the amount of $28,842 for the six-month period ended August 31, 2016 as compared to $34,933 for
the six-month period ended August 31, 2015.  These operating expenses comprised of general and administrative expenses.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Net
cash used in operating activities for the six-month period ended August 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to general and administrative
expenses. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended August 31, 2015 was also primarily attributable to general
and administrative expenses.  

We
are currently dependent on funds raised through shareholder advances from our majority shareholder, Sino Ocean.  Since
our inception on September 23, 2010, we have raised proceeds of $49,000 in cash from the sale of our common stock, and we have
received a total of $249,451 in advances from Sino Ocean for working capital purposes.  

We
currently do not have any credit facilities or other commitments for debt or equity financing.  No assurances can be given
that advances when needed will be available.  We need additional funding to undertake our operations.  Private
capital, if sought, will be sought from private and institutional investors.  To date, we have not sought any funding source
and have not authorized any person or entity to seek out funding on our behalf.  If a market for our shares ever develops,
of which there can be no assurances, we will use shares to compensate employees/consultants and independent contractors wherever
possible.  

We
will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal, and a host of other expenses in connection
with the required filings with the SEC that are associated with being a public company. We estimate that these costs will be approximately
$100,000 per year for the next few years and will be higher if we commence operations under our new business plan and our business
activity increases.  These obligations will reduce our ability and resources to fund other aspects of our business.
 We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use non-cash means of settling obligations
and compensate certain independent contractors who provide professional services to us, although there can be no assurances that
we will be successful in any of those efforts.  

Item
3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks   

As
a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called
for by this Item 3.  

Item
4.    Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls    

As
of August 31, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls    

Our
management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error
and fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but no absolute, assurance
that the objectives of a control system are met.  Further, any control system reflects limitations on resources, and the
benefits of a control system must be considered relative to its costs.  These limitations also include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override
of a control.  A design of a control system is also based upon certain assumptions about potential future conditions; over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and may not be detected.  

Conclusions    

Based
upon their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2016, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have concluded that, subject to the limitations noted above, the disclosure controls were effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by the Company under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting    

There
have been no changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in our internal control over financial reporting
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
