NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND
ORGANIZATION 

GrowLife,
Inc. ( GrowLife  or the  Company ) is
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is
headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The Company was founded in
2012 with the Closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with SGT
Merger Corporation .  

The
Company s goal of becoming the nation s largest
cultivation facility service provider for the production of
organics, herbs and greens and plant-based medicines has not
changed. The Company s mission is to best serve more
cultivators in the design, build-out, expansion and maintenance of
their facilities with products of high quality, exceptional value
and competitive price. Through a nationwide network of
knowledgeable representatives, regional centers and its e-commerce
website, GrowLife provides essential and hard-to-find goods
including media (i.e., farming soil), industry-leading hydroponics
equipment, organic plant nutrients, and thousands more products to
specialty grow operations across the United States. 

The
Company primarily sells through its wholly owned subsidiary,
GrowLife Hydroponics, Inc. GrowLife companies distribute and sell
over 15,000 products through its e-commerce distribution channel,
GrowLifeEco.com, and through our regional retail storefronts.
GrowLife and its business units are organized and directed to
operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and
federal laws. 

On June
7, 2013, GrowLife Hydroponics completed the purchase of Rocky
Mountain Hydroponics, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company
( RMC ), and Evergreen Garden Center, LLC, a Maine
limited liability company ( EGC ). The effective date
of the purchase was June 7, 2013. The Company purchased all of the
assets and liabilities of the RMH and EGC Companies, and their
retail hydroponics stores, which are located in Vail and Boulder,
Colorado and Portland, Maine. The Company purchased RMC and EGC
from Rob Hunt, who was appointed to the then Company s Board
of Directors and President of GrowLife Hydroponics,
Inc. 

On
February 18, 2016, the Company s common stock resumed
unsolicited quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board after receiving
clearance from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
( FINRA ) on our Form 15c2-11. The Company is currently
taking the appropriate steps to uplist to the OTCQB Exchange and
resume priced quotations with market makers as soon as it is
able. 

NOTE 2    

GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company incurred net losses of $1,738,752, $5,688,845
and $86,626,099 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our net cash
used in operating activities was $888,133, $1,375,891 and
$2,122,577 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the
years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.     

The Company anticipates that it will record losses from operations
for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2016, our
accumulated deficit was $118,454,400.   The Company
has experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating
cash flows since inception, and has financed its working capital
requirements during this period primarily through the recurring
issuance of convertible notes payable and advances from a related
party.  The audit report prepared by
our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and filed
with the SEC on April 14, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph
expressing the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern.  

Continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon
obtaining additional working capital.  The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

NOTE 3    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES: ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

Basis of Presentation -  The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The preparation of these unaudited consolidated
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ( GAAP ). 

Principles of Consolidation   -
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries.
Inter-Company items and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  

Cash and Cash Equivalents   - The
Company classifies highly liquid temporary investments with an
original maturity of three months or less when purchased as cash
equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances at various
financial institutions. Balances at US banks are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company
has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is
not exposed to any significant risk for cash on
deposit.    

6 

Accounts Receivable and Revenue -  Revenue is recognized on
the sale of a product when the product is shipped, which is when
the risk of loss transfers to our customers, the fee is fixed and
determinable, and collection of the sale is reasonably assured. A
product is not shipped without an order from the customer and the
completion of credit acceptance procedures. The majority of our
sales are cash or credit card; however, we occasionally extend
terms to our customers. Accounts receivable are reviewed
periodically for collectability. 

Inventories -  Inventories are recorded
on a first in first out basis. Inventory consists of raw materials,
purchased finished goods and components held for resale. Inventory
is valued at the lower of cost or market. The reserve for inventory
was $20,000 as of  September 30, 
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Property and Equipment -  Property and equipment are stated
at cost. Assets acquired held under capital leases are initially
recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease
payments discounted at the implicit interest rate or the fair value
of the asset. Major improvements and betterments are capitalized.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful
life of five years. Assets acquired under capital lease are
depreciated over the lesser of the useful life or the lease term.
At the time of retirement or other disposition of property and
equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in
the consolidated statements of operations. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets -  The Company evaluates the
carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived
assets during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual
evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below
its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not
limited to (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in
business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, (3) an adverse
action or assessment by a regulator, (4) continued losses from
operations, (5) continued negative cash flows from operations, and
(6) the suspension of trading of the Company s securities.
When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, the Company compares
the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is
assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount, including
goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a
combination of the income, or discounted cash flows, approach and
the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies 
data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The
impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair
value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount. In
calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill, the
fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other
assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values. The
excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount
assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair
value of goodwill. 

The
Company amortizes the cost of other intangible assets over their
estimated useful lives, which range up to ten years, unless such
lives are deemed indefinite. Intangible assets with indefinite
lives are tested in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year for
impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. 

Long Lived Assets     The
Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually or
when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets under certain
circumstances are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair
value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide
any future service potential to the Company are recorded at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value (less the projected cost
associated with selling the asset). To the extent carrying values
exceed fair values, an impairment loss is recognized in operating
results.  

Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments -  ASC
Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for
disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure
requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy
is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an
asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are
defined as follows: 

Level 1
- Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices
(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets. 

Level 2
- Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for
similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
instrument. 

Level 3
- Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and
significant to the fair value measurement. 

The
carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, investment in a
related party, accounts payables, accrued expenses, due to related
party, notes payable, and convertible notes approximates their fair
values due to their short-term maturities. 

Derivative financial instruments - The Company evaluates all
of its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are
derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are
accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is
initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each
reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the
consolidated statements of operations. For stock-based derivative
financial instruments, the Company uses a weighted average
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative
instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such
instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is
evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative
instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as
current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement
of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months
of the balance sheet date. 

7 

Sales Returns -  We allow customers to return defective
products when they meet certain established criteria as outlined in
our sales terms and conditions. It is our practice to regularly
review and revise, when deemed necessary, our estimates of sales
returns, which are based primarily on actual historical return
rates. We record estimated sales returns as reductions to sales,
cost of goods sold, and accounts receivable and an increase to
inventory. Returned products which are recorded as inventory are
valued based upon the amount we expect to realize upon its
subsequent disposition. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, there was no reserve for sales returns, which are minimal
based upon our historical experience. 

Stock Based Compensation   - The
Company has share-based compensation plans under which employees,
consultants, suppliers and directors may be granted restricted
stock, as well as options and warrants to purchase shares of
Company common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant.
Stock-based compensation cost to employees is measured by the
Company at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award,
over the requisite service period under ASC 718. For options issued
to employees, the Company recognizes stock compensation costs
utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of
benefit.  Grants of stock to non-employees and other
parties are accounted for in accordance with the ASC
505.  

Net (Loss) Per Share -   Under
the provisions of ASC 260,  Earnings per Share,  basic
loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net
loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised
or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of
common stock that would then share in the income of the Company,
subject to anti-dilution limitations. The common stock equivalents
have not been included as they are anti-dilutive.  As of
 September 30 , 2016, there are
also (i) stock option grants outstanding for the purchase of
24,010,000 common shares at a $0.023 average strike price; (ii)
warrants for the purchase of 565 million common shares at a $0.032
average exercise price; and (iii) 286,989,167  shares related to convertible debt that can be
converted at 0.0036 per share. In addition, we have an unknown
number of common shares to be issued under the  TCA Global
Credit Master Fund LP  and 
Chicago Venture Partners, L.P.  financing agreements.  As of September 30,
2015, there are also (i) stock option grants outstanding for the
purchase of 40.6 million common shares at a $0.058 average strike
price; (ii) warrants for the purchase of 565.0 million common
shares at a $0.035 average exercise price; (iii) 235.6 million
 shares related to convertible debt
that can be converted at 0.007 per share; and (iv) 6.0 million
shares that may be issued to a former executive related to a
severance agreement. We expect to issue $2 million in common stock
or approximately 115.1 million shares related to the settlement of
the Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Action lawsuits
alleging violations of federal securities laws that were filed
against the Company in United States District Court, Central
District of California. The shares were issued on April 6, 2016. In
addition, we had an unknown number of common shares to be issued
under the TCA financing agreements.  

Dividend Policy   - The Company
has never paid any cash dividends and intends, for the foreseeable
future, to retain any future earnings for the development of our
business. Our future dividend policy will be determined by the
board of directors on the basis of various factors, including our
results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements
and investment opportunities.  

Use of Estimates -  In preparing these unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that may
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and
assumptions included in our consolidated financial statements
relate to the valuation of long-lived assets, estimates of sales
returns, inventory reserves and accruals for potential liabilities,
and valuation assumptions related to derivative liability, equity
instruments and share based compensation.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

A variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards
are currently under study by standard setting organizations and
various regulatory agencies. Due to the tentative and preliminary
nature of those proposed standards, management has not determined
whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material
to our consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 4   TRANSACTIONS WITH CANX USA, LLC AND LOGIC WORKS
LLC 

Transactions with CANX, LLC and Logic Works LLC 

On July
10, 2014, the Company closed a Waiver and Modification Agreement,
Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement, Secured Credit
Facility and Secured Convertible Note with CANX, and Logic Works, a
lender and shareholder of the Company. The Agreements require the
filing of a registration statement on Form S-1 within 10 days of
the filing of the Company s Form 10-Q for the period ended
June 30, 2014. Due to the Company s grey sheet trading status
and other issues, the Company did not file the registration
statement. 

8 

Previously,
the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with CANX, a
Nevada limited liability company.  Under the terms of the
Joint Venture Agreement, the Company and CANX formed Organic Growth
International, LLC ( OGI ), a Nevada limited liability
company, for the purpose of expanding the Company s
operations in its current retail hydroponic businesses and in other
synergistic business verticals and facilitating additional funding
for commercially financeable transactions of up to
$40,000,000.  

The
Company initially owned a non-dilutive 45% share of OGI and the
Company may acquire a controlling share of OGI as provided in the
Joint Venture Agreement. In accordance with the Joint Venture
Agreement, the Company and CANX entered into a Warrant Agreement
whereby the Company delivered to CANX a warrant to purchase
140,000,000 shares of the Company common stock that is convertible
at $0.033 per share, subject to adjustment as provided in the
warrant. The five year warrant expires November 18, 2018. Also in
accordance with the Joint Venture Agreement, on February 7, 2014
the Company issued an additional warrant to purchase 100,000,000
shares of our common stock that is convertible at $0.033 per share,
subject to adjustment as provided in the warrant. The five year
warrant expires February 6, 2019. 

Waiver and Modification Agreement 

The
Company entered into a Waiver and Modification Agreement dated June
25, 2014 with Logic Works whereby the 7% Convertible Note with
Logic Works dated December 20, 2013 was modified to provide for (i)
a waiver of the default under the 7% Convertible Note; (ii) a
conversion price which is the lesser of (A) $0.025 or (B) twenty
percent (20%) of the average of the three (3) lowest daily VWAPs
occurring during the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days
immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date on which the
Holder elects to convert all or part of this Note; (iii) the filing
of a registration statement on Form S-1 within 10 days of the
filing of the Company s Form 10-Q for the period ended June
30, 2014; and (iv) continuing interest of 24% per annum. Due to the
Company s grey sheet trading status and other issues, the
Company did not file the registration statement. This 20% of the
average should be 70% and the Parties are working to resolve this
issue. 

Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement 

The
Company entered into an Amended and Restated Joint Venture
Agreement dated July 1, 2014 with CANX whereby the Joint Venture
Agreement dated November 19, 2013 was modified to provide for (i)
up to $12,000,000 in conditional financing subject to review by
GrowLife and approval by OGI for business growth development
opportunities in the legal cannabis industry for up to nine months,
subject to extension; (ii) up to $10,000,000 in working capital
loans, with each loaning requiring approval in advance by CANX;
(iii) confirmed that the five year warrants, subject to adjustment,
at $0.033 per share for the purchase of 140,000,000 and 100,000,000
were fully earned and were not considered compensation for tax
purposes by the Company; (iv) granted CANX five year warrants,
subject to adjustment, to purchase 300,000,000 shares of common
stock at the fair market price of $0.033 per share as determined by
an independent appraisal; (v) warrants as defined in the Agreement
related to the achievement of OGI milestones; (vi) a four year
term, subject to adjustment and (vi) the filing of a registration
statement on Form S-1 within 10 days of the filing of the
Company s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014. Due
to the Company s grey sheet trading status and other issues,
the Company did not file the registration statement. 

Secured Convertible Note and Secured Credit Facility 

The
Company entered into a Secured Convertible Note and Secured Credit
Facility dated June 25, 2014 with Logic Works whereby Logic Works
agreed to provide up to $500,000 in funding. Each funding requires
approval in advance by Logic Works, provides for interest at 6%
with a default interest of 24% per annum and requires repayment by

6% Senior Secured Convertible Notes Payable (2012)

Exchange Agreement with investors, including Sterling Scott, our

Secured Convertible Notes that were previously issued during 2012.
The 6% Notes accrued interest at the rate of 6% per annum and had a

however, accrued interest was due at maturity. In the event of a
default the investors may declare the entire principal and accrued

the conversion feature was a beneficial conversion
feature.

Two  of the Amended and Restated 6% Senior Secured
Convertible Note  which provide for an
increase in the interest rate from 6% to 10% and the default
interest rate from 12% to 20% on the 6% Senior Secured Convertible
Notes for so long as the Company remains in technical default on
said notes due to its delisting from its Primary Trading Market
April 2014. The Company further agreed that said 20% default
interest will be applied to the date of default on April 10, 2014

related to these 6% convertible notes. Two investors converted

Funding from TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP
( TCA ) 

The First TCA SPA .  On July 9,
2015, the Company closed a Securities Purchase Agreement and
related agreements with  TCA Global Credit Master Fund LP
( TCA ),  an accredited
investor, whereby the Company agreed to sell and TCA agreed to
purchase up to $3,000,000     of
senior secured convertible, redeemable debentures, of which
$700,000 was purchased on July 9, 2015 and up to $2,300,000 may be
purchased in additional closings. The closing of the transaction
(the  First TCA SPA ) occurred on July 9, 2015.
Effective as of May 4, 2016, the Company and TCA entered into a
First Amendment to the First TCA SPA whereby the parties agreed to
amend the terms of the First TCA SPA in exchange for TCA s
forbearance of existing defaults by the
Company.  

The Second TCA SPA  . On August
6, 2015, the Company closed a second Securities Purchase Agreement
and related agreements with  TCA  whereby the Company agreed to sell and TCA agreed
to purchase a $100,000 senior secured convertible redeemable
debenture and the Company agreed to issue and sell to TCA, from
time to time, and TCA agreed to purchase from the Company up to
$3,000,000 of the Company s common stock pursuant to a
committed equity facility. The closing of the transaction (the
 Second TCA SPA ) occurred on August 6, 2015. On April
11, 2016, the Company agreed with TCA to mutually terminate the
Second TCA SPA.  

Amendment to the First TCA SPA . On October 27, 2015, the
Company entered into an Amended and Restated Securities Purchase
Agreement and related agreements with TCA whereby the Company
agreed to sell, and TCA agreed to purchase $350,000 of senior
secured convertible, redeemable debentures. This was an amendment
to the First TCA SPA (the  Amendment to the First TCA
SPA .) As of October 27, 2015, the Company sold $1,050,000 in
Debentures to TCA and up to $1,950,000 in Debentures remain for
sale by the Company. The closing of the Amendment to the First TCA
SPA occurred on October 27, 2015. In addition, TCA has advanced the
Company an additional $100,000 for a total of
$1,150.000. 

12 

Issuance of Preferred Stock to TCA . Also, on October 21,
2015 the Company issued 150,000 Series B Preferred Stock at a
stated value equal to $10.00 per share to TCA.  The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into
common stock by dividing the stated value of the shares being
converted by 100% of the average of the five (5) lowest closing bid
prices for the common stock during the ten (10) consecutive trading
days immediately preceding the conversion date as quoted by
Bloomberg, LP.  On October 21, 2015, we also issued 51 shares
of Series C Preferred Stock at $0.0001 par value per share to TCA.
The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into our common
stock.  In the event of a default under
the Amended and Restated TCA Transaction Documents, TCA can
exercise voting control over our common stock with their Series C
Preferred Stock voting rights.  

TCA s Forbearance  . Due to
the Company s default on its repayment obligations under the
TCA SPA s and related documents, the parties agreed to
restructure the SPA s whereby TCA agreed to forbear from
enforcement of our defaults and to restructure a payment schedule
for repayment of debt under the SPAs. The Company defaulted because
our operating results were not as expected and the Company were
unable to generate sufficient revenue through its business
operations to serve the TCA debt. Specifically, the First Amendment
to Amended and Restated Securities Purchase Agreement made the
following material modifications to the existing
SPA s:  

All
unpaid debentures were modified as described in more detail
below. 

Payments
on the debentures shall be made by (i) debt purchase agreement(s)
to be entered into by TCA, (ii) through proceeds raised from the
transaction(s) with Chicago Venture; or (iii) by the Company
directly. 

The
due date of the debentures was extended to April 28,
2018. 

TCA
agreed that it shall not enforce and shall forbear from pursuing
enforcement of any existing defaults by us unless and until a
future Company default occurs. 

In furtherance of TCA s forbearance, effective as of May 4,
2016, the Company issued Second Replacement Debenture A in the
principal amount of $150,000 and Second Replacement Debenture B in
the principal amount of $2,681,210 (collectively, the  Second
Replacement Debentures ). 

Per the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Second Replacement Debentures were combined, and
apportioned into two separate replacement debentures. The Second
Replacement Debentures were intended to act in substitution for and
to supersede the debentures in their entirety. It was the intent of
the Company and TCA that while the Second Replacement Debentures
replace and supersede the debentures, in their entirety, they were
not in payment or satisfaction of the debentures, but rather were
the substitute of one evidence of debt for another without any
intent to extinguish the old debt. As of September 30, 2016, the
maximum number of shares subject to conversion under the Second
Replacement Debentures is19,401,389. This is an approximation. The
estimation of the maximum number of shares issuable upon the
conversion of the Second Replacement Debentures was
calculated  using an estimated average price of $.0036 per
share. 

The Second Replacement Debentures contemplate TCA entering into
debt purchase agreement(s) with third parties whereby TCA may, at
its election, sever, split, divide or apportion the Second
Replacement Debentures to accomplish the repayment of the balance
owed to TCA by Company. The Second Replacement Debentures are
convertible at 85% of the lowest daily volume weighted average
price ( VWAP ) of the Company s common stock
during the five (5) business days immediately prior to a conversion
date. 

In connection with the above agreements, the parties acknowledged
and agreed that certain advisory fees previously paid to TCA as
provided in the SPAs in the amount of $1,500.000 have been added
and included within the principal balance of the Second Replacement
Debentures. The advisory fees related too financial, merger and
acquisition and regulatory services provided to the Company. The
conversion price discount on the Second Replacement Debentures will
not apply to the advisory fees added to the Second Replacement
Debentures. TCA also agreed to surrender its Series B Preferred
Stock in exchange for the $1,500,000 being added to the Second
Replacement Debenture. 

As more
particularly described below, the Company remains in debt to TCA
for the principal amount of $1,500,000. The remaining $1,400,000 of
principal debt was assigned to Old Main Capital, LLC (see
discussion immediately below.) The Company intends to use the funds
generated from the Chicago Venture transaction to fuel its business
operations and business plans which, in turn, will presumably
generate revenues sufficient to avoid another default in the
remaining TCA obligations. If the Company is unable to raise
sufficient funds through the Chicago Venture transaction and/or
generate sales sufficient to service the remaining TCA debt then
the Company will be unable to avoid another default. Failure to
operate in accordance with the various agreements with TCA could
result in the cancellation of these agreements, result in
foreclosure on the Company s assets in an event of default
which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition. 

At the
date of the TCA debt restructuring the remaining unamortized
discount was expensed to interest in the amount of $482,112 and the
Company recognized a loss on restructuring of $
279,897. 

13 

As of
 September 30,  2016, the Company
is indebted to TCA under the First and Second Replacement
Debentures in the amount of $2,189,691, accrued interest was $8,759
and the unamortized debt discount was $863,432, which results in a
net amount of $1,335,018. 

As
discussed below, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
Old Main Capital LLC converted principal and accrued interest of
$713,000 into 132,285,079 shares of our common stock at a per share
conversion price of $0.0054. 

As
discussed below during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
Chicago Venture Partners, L.P. converted principal and accrued
interest of $128,000 into 22,371,716 shares of our common stock at
a per share conversion price of $0.0057. 

The Company has recorded a loss on these transactions in the amount
of $464,473. 

TCA Assignment of Debt to Old Main Capital, LLC 

On June 9, 2016, the Company closed a Debt Purchase Agreement and
related agreements (the  Old Main Transaction
Documents ) with TCA and Old Main Capital, LLC ( Old
Main ) whereby TCA agreed to sell and Old Main agreed to
purchase in multiple tranches $1,400,000 in senior secured
convertible, redeemable debentures (the  Assigned
Debt ) (the  Old Main Transaction ). The Assigned
Debt was our debt incurred in the TCA financing transactions that
closed in 2015. We were required to execute the Old Main
Transaction Documents as the Company is the  borrower 
on the Assigned Debt. 

Debt Purchase Agreement.   As set
forth above, the Company entered into the Debt Purchase Agreement
on June 9, 2015 with TCA and Old Main whereby Old Main agreed to
purchase, in tranches, $1,400,000 of debt previously held by TCA.
The Company executed the Debt Purchase Agreement as it was the
 borrower  under the Assigned Debt and was required to
make certain representations and warranties regarding the Assigned
Debt. The Assigned Debt is represented by a new  10% Senior
Convertible Promissory Note  entered into by and between Old
Main and the Company (more particularly described
below.)  

Exchange Agreement.   In
conjunction with the Debt Purchase Agreement, on June 9, 2016, the
Company entered into an Exchange Agreement whereby we agreed to
exchange, in tranches, the Assigned Debt, as well as any amendments
thereto, with a 10% Senior Convertible Promissory Note (the
 Note )     having
a principal balance of $1,400,000. The closing dates for the
exchanges, scheduled to occur in tranches, are set forth in
Schedule 1 attached to the Exchange Agreement.  

10% Senior Convertible Promissory Note.   Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company
entered into a 10% Senior Convertible Promissory Note dated June 9,
2016 with Old Main whereby the Company agreed to be indebted to Old
Main for the Assigned Debt. The Company promised to pay Old Main,
by no later than the maturity date of June 9, 2017 the outstanding
principal of the Assigned Debt together with interest on the
outstanding principal amount under the Note, at the rate of ten
percent (10%) per annum simple interest.  

At any time after June 9, 2016, and while the Note is still
outstanding and at the sole option of Old Main, Old Main may
convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal, accrued
and unpaid interest redemption premium and any other sums due and
payable hereunder or under any of the other Transaction Documents
into shares of our Common Stock at a price equal to the lower of:
(i) sixty-five percent (65%) of the lowest traded price of the
Company s Common Stock during the thirty (30) trading days
prior to the Conversion Date; or (ii) sixty-five percent (65%) of
the lowest traded price of the Common Stock in the thirty (30)
Trading Days prior to the Closing Date. 

Option Agreement.   In connection
with the Old Main Transaction Documents, TCA and Old Main entered
into an Option Agreement dated June 8, 2016 whereby TCA agreed to
grant Old Main an option to purchase the Assigned Debt, or any
portion thereof, under the terms and conditions of the Debt
Purchase Agreement. In consideration, Old Main agreed to pay the
Option Payment as more particularly described in the Option
Agreement.  

On August 24, 2016, TCA terminated its Debt Purchase Agreement and
related agreements with Old Main. The specific termination date is
September 25, 2016, and Old Main had a right to purchase an
additional $300,000 in debt from TCA. 

As
discussed below, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
Old Main converted principal and accrued interest of $713,000 into
132,285,079 shares of our common stock at a per share conversion
price of $0.0054.

Venture ) 

Securities Purchase Agreement with Chicago Venture Partners,
L.P.  As of April 4, 2016, the Company entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement and Convertible Promissory Note (the
 Chicago Venture Note ) with Chicago Venture, whereby
we agreed to sell, and Chicago Venture agreed to purchase an
unsecured convertible promissory note in the original principal
amount of $2,755,000. In connection with the transaction, the
Company received $350,000 in cash as well as a series of twelve
Secured Investor Notes for a total Purchase Price of $2,500,000.
The Note carries an Original Issue Discount ( OID ) of

expenses. 

The
Secured Investor Notes are payable (i) $50,000 upon filing of a
Registration Statement on Form S-1; (ii) $100,000 upon
effectiveness of the Registration Statement; and (iii) up to
$200,000 per month over the 10 months following effectiveness at
our sole discretion, subject to certain conditions. The Company
filed the Registration Statement within forty-five (45) days of the
Closing and agreed to register shares of our common stock for the
benefit of Chicago Venture in exchange for the payments under the
Secured Investor Notes. 

Chicago
Venture has the option to convert the Note at 65% of the average of
the three (3) lowest volume weighted average prices in the twenty
(20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable conversion
(the  Conversion Price ). However, in no event will the
Conversion Price be less than $0.02 or greater than $0.09. In
addition, beginning on the date that is the earlier of six (6)
months or five (5) days after the Registration Statement becomes
effective, and on the same day of each month thereafter, the
Company will re-pay the Note in monthly installments in cash, or,
subject to certain Equity Conditions, in the Company s common
stock at 65% of the average of the three (3) lowest volume weighted
average prices in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately
preceding the applicable conversion (the  Installment
Conversion Price ). 

As
discussed above, once effective, the Company has the discretion to
require Chicago Venture to sell to us up to $200,000 per month over
the next 10 months on the above terms. The Company would then have
the option to issue shares registered under this Registration
Statement to Chicago Venture. Through this prospectus, the selling
stockholder may offer to the public for resale shares of the
Company s common stock that we may issue to Chicago Venture
pursuant to the Chicago Venture Note. 

For a
period of no more than 36 months from the effective date of the
Registration Statement, we may, from time to time, at the
Company s sole discretion, and subject to certain conditions
that we must satisfy, draw down funds under the Chicago Venture
Note. 

The
Company s ability to require Chicago Venture to fund the
Chicago Venture Note is at its discretion, subject to certain
limitations. Chicago Venture is obligated to fund if each of the

dollar volumes of the Company s common stock for the twenty

obligations under the note as of the funding date; and (iv) the
Company is current in its reporting obligations. Chicago
Venture  obligations under the equity line are not
transferable. 

The
issuance of the Company s common stock under the Chicago
Venture Note will have no effect on the rights or privileges of
existing holders of common stock except that the economic and
voting interests of each stockholder will be diluted as a result of
any such issuance. Although the number of shares of common stock
that stockholders presently own will not decrease, these shares
will represent a smaller percentage of the Company s total
shares that will be outstanding after any issuances of shares of
common stock to Chicago Venture. If the Company s draw down
amounts under the Chicago Venture Note when the Company s
share price is decreasing, the Company will need to issue more
shares to repay the same amount than if the Company s stock
price was higher. Such issuances will have a dilutive effect and
may further decrease our stock price. 

There
is no guarantee that the Company will be able to meet the foregoing
conditions or any other conditions under the Securities Purchase
Agreement and/or Chicago Venture Note or that the Company will be
able to draw down any portion of the amounts available under the
Securities Purchase Agreement and/or Chicago Venture Note. However,
the Company does believe there is a strong likelihood, as long as
we can meet the various conditions to funding, that the Company
will receive the full amount of funding under the equity line of
credit. Given the Company s financial challenges and the
competitive nature of our business, the Company also believes it
will need the full amount of funding under the equity line of
credit in order to fully realize the business plans. 

A
portion of the funds received from Chicago Venture will be used to
pay off TCA, a previous equity financing partner and a portion will
be invested in our business. Specifically, the Company anticipates
that approximately $1,400,000 is expected to be used to pay TCA and
the remaining funds, if any, will be used for general business
purposes such as marketing, product development, expansion and
administrative costs. The Company is not aware of any relationship
between TCA and Chicago Venture. The Company has had no previous
transactions with Chicago Venture or any of Chicago Venture s
affiliates. The Company cannot predict whether the Chicago Venture
transaction will have either a positive or negative impact on our
stock price. However, in addition to the fact that each Chicago
Venture conversion, when and if it occurs, has a dilutive effect on
the Company s stock price, that should Chicago Venture
convert large portions of the debt into registered shares and then
sells those shares on the market, that the Company s stock
price could be depressed. 

15 

As
 of September 30,  2016, the
outstanding balance due to Chicago Venture is $905,000, accrued
interest was $30,916, net of the OID of $183,005, which results in
a net amount of $752,911. The OID has been recorded as a discount
to debt and will be amortized over the life of the
loan. 

As
discussed below during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
Chicago Venture converted principal and accrued interest of
$128,000 into 22,371,716 shares of our common stock at a per share
conversion price of $0.0057. 

Debt Purchase Agreement and First Amendment to Debt Purchase
Agreement and Note Assignment Agreement   On August 24, 2016, the Company closed a Debt
Purchase Agreement and a First Amendment to Debt Purchase Agreement
and related agreements with Chicago Venture and
TCA.  

On August 24, 2016, TCA closed an Assignment of Note Agreement and
related agreements with Chicago Venture. The referenced agreements
relate to the assignment of Company debt, in the form of
debentures, by TCA to Chicago Venture. The Company was a party to
the agreements between TCA and Chicago Venture because the Company
is the  borrower  under the TCA held
debentures. 

Exchange Agreement, Convertible Promissory Note and related
Agreements with Chicago Venture   On August 17, 2016, the Company closed an Exchange
Agreement and a Convertible Promissory Note and related agreements
with Chicago Venture whereby the Company agreed to the assignment
of debentures representing debt between the Company, on the one
hand, and with  TCA, on the other hand. Specifically, the
Company agreed that TCA could assign a portion of the
Company s debt held by TCA to Chicago Venture. 

According
to the Exchange Agreement, the debt is to be assigned in tranches,
with the first tranche of debt assigned from TCA to Chicago Venture
being $128,000 which is represented by an Initial Exchange Note as
defined in the Exchange Agreement. 

NOTE 8   DERIVATIVE LIABILITY 

In
April 2008, the FASB issued a pronouncement that provides guidance
on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an
instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to
its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first criteria of
the scope exception in the pronouncement on accounting for
derivatives. This pronouncement was effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008. The adoption of these requirements can affect the accounting
for warrants and many convertible instruments with provisions that
protect holders from a decline in the stock price (or
 down-round  provisions). For example, warrants or
conversion features with such provisions are no longer recorded in
equity. Down-round provisions reduce the exercise price of a
warrant or convertible instrument if a company either issues equity
shares for a price that is lower than the exercise price of those
instruments or issues new warrants or convertible instruments that
have a lower exercise price. 

Derivative
liability as of  September 30, 
2016 is as follows: 

For the
nine months ended  September 30, 
2016, the Company recorded non-cash income of $496,806 related to
the  change in fair value of derivative  expense
related to its 6%, 7% and 18% convertible notes. 

16 

Derivative
liability as of December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

For the
year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded non-cash income
of $723,740 related to the  change in fair value of
derivative  expense related to its 6%, 7% and 18% convertible
notes. 

The
risk-free rate of return reflects the interest rate for the United
States Treasury Note with similar time-to-maturity to that of the
warrants.   

7% Convertible Notes 

As of
December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding 7% convertible notes
for $500,000 that the Company determined had an embedded derivative
liability due to the  reset  clause associated with the
note s conversion price. The Company valued the derivative
liability of these notes at $105,515 using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model, which approximates the Monte Carlo and other
binomial valuation techniques, with the following
assumptions (i) dividend yield of 0%; (ii) expected volatility
of 133.2%; (iii) risk free rate of .001%, (iv) stock price of
$.005, (v) per share conversion price of $0.007, and (vi) expected
term of .25 years, as the Company estimated that these notes will
be converted by March 31, 2016. 

As of
 September 30,  2016, the Company
had outstanding 7% convertible notes with a remaining balance of
$268,573 that the Company determined had an embedded derivative
liability due to the  reset  clause associated with the
note s conversion price. The Company valued the derivative
liability of these notes at $472,426 using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model, which approximates the Monte Carlo and other
binomial valuation techniques, with the following
assumptions (i) dividend yield of 0%; (ii) expected volatility
of 145.8%; (iii) risk free rate of .002%, (iv) stock price of
$.0057, (v) per share conversion price of $0.0036, and (vi)
expected term of .25 years, as the Company estimates that these
notes will be converted by December 31, 2016. 

6% Convertible Notes 

As of
December 31, 2015, the Company had outstanding unsecured 6%
convertible notes for $350,000 that the Company determined were a
derivative liability due to the  reset  clause
associated with the note s conversion price. The Company
valued the derivative liability of these notes at $54,377 using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. which approximates
the Monte Carlo and other binomial valuation techniques, with the
following assumptions (i) dividend yield of 0%; (ii) expected
volatility of 133.2%; (iii) risk free rate of 0.34%, (iv) stock
price of $.005, (v) per share conversion price of $0.007, and (vi)
expected term of .56 years. 

As of
 September 30,  2016, the Company
had outstanding unsecured 6% convertible notes for $350,000 that
the Company determined had an embedded derivative liability due to
the  reset  clause associated with the note s
conversion price. The Company valued the derivative liability of
these notes at $330,338 using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
pricing model, which approximates the Monte Carlo and other
binomial valuation techniques, with the following
assumptions (i) dividend yield of 0%; (ii) expected volatility
of 145.8%; (iii) risk free rate of .002%, (iv) stock price of
$.0057, (v) per share conversion price of $0.0036, and (vi)
expected term of .25 years, as the Company estimates that these
notes will be converted by December 31, 2016. 

Funding from TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP
( TCA ). 

The First TCA SPA .  On July 9,
2015, the Company closed a Securities Purchase Agreement and
related agreements with  TCA Global Credit Master Fund LP
( TCA ),  an accredited
investor, whereby the Company agreed to sell and TCA agreed to
purchase up to $3,000,000     of
senior secured convertible, redeemable debentures, of which
$700,000 was purchased on July 9, 2015 and up to $2,300,000 may be
purchased in additional closings. The closing of the transaction
(the  First TCA SPA ) occurred on July 9, 2015.
Effective as of May 4, 2016, the Company and TCA entered into a
First Amendment to the First TCA SPA whereby the parties agreed to
amend the terms of the First TCA SPA in exchange for TCA s
forbearance of existing defaults by the
Company.  

17 

The Second TCA SPA  . On August
6, 2015, the Company closed a second Securities Purchase Agreement
and related agreements with  TCA  whereby the Company agreed to sell and TCA agreed
to purchase a $100,000 senior secured convertible redeemable
debenture and the Company agreed to issue and sell to TCA, from
time to time, and TCA agreed to purchase from the Company up to
$3,000,000 of the Company s common stock pursuant to a
committed equity facility. The closing of the transaction (the
 Second TCA SPA ) occurred on August 6, 2015. On April
11, 2016, the Company agreed with TCA to mutually terminate the
Second TCA SPA.  

Amendment to the First TCA SPA . On October 27, 2015, the
Company entered into an Amended and Restated Securities Purchase
Agreement and related agreements with TCA whereby the Company
agreed to sell, and TCA agreed to purchase $350,000 of senior
secured convertible, redeemable debentures. This was an amendment
to the First TCA SPA (the  Amendment to the First TCA
SPA .) As of October 27, 2015, the Company sold $1,050,000 in
Debentures to TCA and up to $1,950,000 in Debentures remain for
sale by the Company. The closing of the Amendment to the First TCA
SPA occurred on October 27, 2015. In addition, TCA has advanced the
Company an additional $100,000 for a total of
$1,150.000. 

Issuance of Preferred Stock to TCA . Also, on October 21,
2015 the Company issued 150,000 Series B Preferred Stock at a
stated value equal to $10.00 per share to TCA.  The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into
common stock by dividing the stated value of the shares being
converted by 100% of the average of the five (5) lowest closing bid
prices for the common stock during the ten (10) consecutive trading
days immediately preceding the conversion date as quoted by
Bloomberg, LP.  On October 21, 2015, we also issued 51 shares
of Series C Preferred Stock at $0.0001 par value per share to TCA.
The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into our common
stock.  In the event of a default under
the Amended and Restated TCA Transaction Documents, TCA can
exercise voting control over our common stock with their Series C
Preferred Stock voting rights.  

TCA s Forbearance  . Due to
the Company s default on its repayment obligations under the
TCA SPA s and related documents, the parties agreed to
restructure the SPA s whereby TCA agreed to forbear from
enforcement of our defaults and to restructure a payment schedule
for repayment of debt under the SPAs. The Company defaulted because
our operating results were not as expected and the Company were
unable to generate sufficient revenue through its business
operations to serve the TCA debt. Specifically, the First Amendment
to Amended and Restated Securities Purchase Agreement made the
following material modifications to the existing
SPA s:  

All
unpaid debentures were modified as described in more detail
below. 

Payments
on the debentures shall be made by (i) debt purchase agreement(s)
to be entered into by TCA, (ii) through proceeds raised from the
transaction(s) with Chicago Venture; or (iii) by the Company
directly. 

The
due date of the debentures was extended to April 28,
2018. 

TCA
agreed that it shall not enforce and shall forbear from pursuing
enforcement of any existing defaults by us unless and until a
future Company default occurs. 

In furtherance of TCA s forbearance, effective as of May 4,
2016, the Company issued Second Replacement Debenture A in the
principal amount of $150,000 and Second Replacement Debenture B in
the principal amount of $2,681,210 (collectively, the  Second
Replacement Debentures ). 

Per the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Second Replacement Debentures were combined, and
apportioned into two separate replacement debentures. The Second
Replacement Debentures were intended to act in substitution for and
to supersede the debentures in their entirety. It was the intent of
the Company and TCA that while the Second Replacement Debentures
replace and supersede the debentures, in their entirety, they were
not in payment or satisfaction of the debentures, but rather were
the substitute of one evidence of debt for another without any
intent to extinguish the old debt. As of September 30, 2016, the
maximum number of shares subject to conversion under the Second
Replacement Debentures is 19,401,389. This is an approximation. The
estimation of the maximum number of shares issuable upon the
conversion of the Second Replacement Debentures was
calculated  using an estimated average price of $.0036 per
share. 

The Second Replacement Debentures contemplate TCA entering into
debt purchase agreement(s) with third parties whereby TCA may, at
its election, sever, split, divide or apportion the Second
Replacement Debentures to accomplish the repayment of the balance
owed to TCA by Company. The Second Replacement Debentures are
convertible at 85% of the lowest daily volume weighted average
price ( VWAP ) of the Company s common stock
during the five (5) business days immediately prior to a conversion
date. 

In connection with the above agreements, the parties acknowledged
and agreed that certain advisory fees previously paid to TCA as
provided in the SPAs in the amount of $1,.500,.000 have been added
and included within the principal balance of the Second Replacement
Debentures. The advisory fees related too financial, merger and
acquisition and regulatory services provided to the Company. The
conversion price discount on the Second Replacement Debentures will
not apply to the advisory fees added to the Second Replacement
Debentures. TCA also agreed to surrender its Series B Preferred
Stock in exchange for the $1,500,000 being added to the Second
Replacement Debenture. 

18 

As more
particularly described below, the Company s remain in debt to
TCA for the principal amount of $1,500,000. The remaining
$1,400,000 of principal debt was assigned to Old Main Capital, LLC
(see discussion immediately below.) The Company intends to use the
funds generated from the Chicago Venture transaction to fuel its
business operations and business plans which, in turn, will
presumably generate revenues sufficient to avoid another default in
the remaining TCA obligations. If the Company is unable to raise
sufficient funds through the Chicago Venture transaction and/or
generate sales sufficient to service the remaining TCA debt then
the Company will be unable to avoid another default. Failure to
operate in accordance with the various agreements with TCA could
result in the cancellation of these agreements, result in
foreclosure on the Company s assets in an event of default
which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition. 

On July 9, 2015,  the Company valued the conversion feature
as a derivative liability of this  senior secured convertible redeemable
debenture  at $888,134 and discounted debt by $700,000 and
recorded interest expense of $188,134. The Company valued the
derivative liability of this debenture at $888,134 using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. which approximates
the Monte Carlo and other binomial valuation techniques, with the
following assumptions (i) dividend yield of 0%; (ii) expected
volatility of 160.0%; (iii) risk free rate of 0.25%, (iv) stock
price of $0.02, (v) per share conversion price of $0.011, and (vi)
expected term of 1.0 years. 

At the
inception of the Replacement Debentures, the embedded derivative
liability was remeasured at fair value and the Company recorded a
net gain of $420,822, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
model which approximates the Monte Carlo and other binomial
valuation techniques, with the following assumptions (i)
dividend yield of 0%; (ii) expected volatility of 150.0%; (iii)
risk free rate of 0.001%, (iv) stock price of $0.015, (v) per share
conversion price of $0.013, and (vi) expected term of 1.0
year. 

At
inception, the Company valued the conversion feature of the
Replacement Debentures as a derivative liability in the amount of
$979,716 using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing
model. which approximates the Monte Carlo and other binomial
valuation techniques, with the following assumptions (i)
dividend yield of 0%; (ii) expected volatility of 150.0%; (iii)
risk free rate of .52%, (iv) stock price of $.015, (v) per share
conversion price of $0.013, and (vi) expected term of 1.0 years, as
the Company estimated that the Replacement Debentures will be
converted by September 30, 2017. The amount was recorded as a
discount to debt and will be amortized over the life of the
debentures. As of June 30, 2016, the Company amortized $5,698 to
interest expense. 

As of
September 30,   2016, the
Company revalued the embedded derivative liability of the
Replacement Debentures at $77,608 using the Black-Scholes-Merton
option pricing model. which approximates the Monte Carlo and
other binomial valuation techniques, with the following
assumptions (i) dividend yield of 0%; (ii) expected volatility
of 150.5%; (iii) risk free rate of .002%, (iv) stock price of
$.0057 (v) per share conversion price of $0.0036, and (vi) expected
term of 1.0 year, as the Company estimates that these notes will be
converted or assigned in total to Chicago Venture by September 30,
2017.

NOTE 10  EQUITY 

Authorized
Capital Stock 

The
Company has authorized 3,010,000,000 shares of capital stock, of
which 3,000,000,000 are shares of voting common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 are shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.0001 per share. 

Non-Voting
Preferred Stock 

Under
the terms of our articles of incorporation, the Company s
board of directors is authorized to issue shares of non-voting
preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval.
The Company s board of directors has the discretion to
determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and
liquidation preferences, of each series of non-voting preferred
stock. 

The
purpose of authorizing the Company s board of directors to
issue non-voting preferred stock and determine the Company s
rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a
stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of non-voting
preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with
possible acquisitions, future financings and other corporate
purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a
third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from
seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
Other than the Series B and C Preferred Stock discussed below,
there are no shares of non-voting preferred stock presently
outstanding and we have no present plans to issue any shares of
preferred stock. 

Series B Preferred Stock Designation 

In
connection with the Amended and Restated Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Board of Directors, on October 21, 2015, approved
the authorization of a Series B Preferred Stock as provided in our
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. 

The
Series B Preferred Stock has authorized 150,000 shares with a
stated value equal to $10.00 per share. Dividends payable to other
classes of stock are restricted until repayment of the aggregate
value of Series B Preferred Stock. Upon the Company s
liquidation or dissolution, Series B Preferred Stock has no
priority or preference with respect to distributions of any assets
by the Company. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into
common stock by dividing the stated value of the shares being
converted by 100% of the average of the five lowest closing bid
prices for the common stock during the ten consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the conversion date as quoted by Bloomberg,
LP. 

TCA was
issued 150,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. However, in no
event will Purchaser be entitled to hold in excess of 4.99% of the
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. 

In
connection with the First Amendment to Amended and Restated
Securities Purchase Agreement, TCA is surrendering the Series B
Preferred Stock. 

Series C Preferred Stock Designation 

In
connection with the Amended and Restated Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Board of Directors, on October 21, 2015, approved
the authorization of a Series C Preferred Stock as provided in the
Company s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and the
issuance of 51 shares of Series C Preferred Stock. These shares
only have voting rights in the event of a default by us under the
Amended and Restated Transaction Documents. The Series C Preferred
Stock is cancelled with the repayment of the TCA debt. 

20 

The
Series C Preferred Stock Designation authorizes 51 shares of Series
C Preferred Stock. Series C Preferred Stock is not entitled to
dividend or liquidation rights and is not convertible into our
common stock. 

In the
event of a default under the Amended and Restated Transaction
Documents, each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall have voting
votes equal to 0.019607 multiplied by the total issued and
outstanding common stock and preferred stock eligible to vote
divided by .49 minus the numerator. For example, if the total
issued and outstanding common stock eligible to vote is 5,000,000,
the voting rights of one share of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
equal to 102,036 (e.g. ((0.019607 x 5,000,000/0.49)  
(0.019607 x 5,000,000) = 102,036).  In
the event of a default under the Amended and Restated TCA
Transaction Documents, TCA can exercise voting control over our
common stock.  

Common
Stock 

Unless otherwise indicated, all of the following sales or issuances
of Company securities were conducted under the exemption from
registration as provided under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933 (and also qualified for exemption under 4(5), formerly 4(6)
of the Securities Act of 1933, except as noted below). All of the
shares issued were issued in transactions not involving a public
offering, are considered to be restricted stock as defined in Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 and stock
certificates issued with respect thereto bear legends to that
effect.  

The Company has compensated consultants and service providers with
restricted common stock during the development of our business and
when our capital resources were not adequate to provide payment in
cash. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had
had the following sales of unregistered of equity securities to
accredited investors unless otherwise indicated:

Financial Officer, pursuant to a conversion of debt for $30,000.
The shares were valued at the fair market price of $0.01 per
share. 

On

NOTE 11   STOCK OPTIONS 

Description of Stock Option Plan 

In
fiscal year 2011, the Company authorized a Stock Incentive Plan
whereby a maximum of 18,870,184 shares of the Company s
common stock could be granted in the form of Non-Qualified Stock
Options, Incentive Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights,
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Other Stock-Based
Awards. On April 18, 2013, the Company s Board of Directors
voted to increase to 35,000,000 the maximum allowable shares of the
Company s common stock allocated to the 2011 Stock Incentive
Plan. The Company has outstanding unexercised stock option grants
totaling 24,010,000 shares as of  September 30,  2016. All grants are
non-qualified as the plan was not approved by the shareholders
within one year of its adoption. 

Determining Fair Value under ASC 505 

The Company records compensation expense associated with stock
options and other equity-based compensation using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model for estimating fair
value of stock options granted under our plan. The Company
amortizes the fair value of stock options on a ratable basis over
the requisite service periods, which are generally the vesting
periods. The expected life of awards granted represents the period
of time that they are expected to be outstanding.  The
Company estimates the volatility of our common stock based on the
historical volatility of its own common stock over the most recent
period corresponding with the estimated expected life of the award.
The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black
Scholes-Merton option valuation model on the implied yield
currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an
equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.
The Company has not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and
does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable
future. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield
of zero in the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model and
adjusts share-based compensation for changes to the estimate of
expected equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture
experience. The effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate is
recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is
changed. 

Stock Option Activity 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had
the following stock option activity: 

An
entity controlled by Mr. Scott had a two million share stock option
that was previously issued vest on April 18, 2016 upon the Company
securing a market maker with an approved 15c2-11 resulting in the
Company s relisting on OTCBB. 

Mr.
Belmont resigned January 13, 2016 and an option to purchase five
million shares of the Company s common stock under the
Company s 2011 Stock Incentive Plan expired on April 13,
2016. 

An
employee forfeited a stock grant for 10,000 shares of the
Company s common stock during the nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

As of September 30 2016, there are  24,010,000  options to purchase common stock at an average
exercise price of $0.023 per share outstanding under the 2011 Stock
Incentive Plan. The Company recorded $98,173 and $138,532 of
compensation expense, net of related tax effects, relative to stock
options for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, in accordance with ASC 505. Net loss per share (basic
and diluted) associated with this expense was approximately
($0.00). As of September 30, 2016, there is $114,379 of total
unrecognized costs related to employee granted stock options that
are not vested. These costs are expected to be recognized over a
period of approximately 3.08 years.

and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as

NOTE 12    COMMITMENTS,
CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

Legal Proceedings 

The
Company is involved in the disputes and legal proceedings described
below. In addition, as a public company, the Company is also
potentially susceptible to litigation, such as claims asserting
violations of securities laws. Any such claims, with or without
merit, if not resolved, could be time-consuming and result in
costly litigation. The Company accrues any contingent liabilities
that are likely. 

Class Actions Alleging Violations of Federal Securities
Laws 

Beginning on April 18, 2014, three class action lawsuits alleging
violations of federal securities laws were filed against the
Company in United States District Court, Central District of
California (the  Court ). At a hearing held on July 21,
2014, the three class action lawsuits were consolidated into one
case with Lawrence Rosen as the lead plaintiff (the
 Consolidated Class Action,  styled Romero et al. vs.
GrowLife et al.). On May 15, 2014 and August 4, 2014, respectively
two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against the Company
with the Court (the  Derivative Actions ). On October
20, 2014, AmTrust North America, the Company s insurer, filed
a lawsuit contesting insurance coverage on the above legal
proceedings. The Company made a general appearance in this action.
On January 20, 2015, the Court ordered all of the above actions
stayed pending completion of mediation of the dispute. On April 27,
2015, the Court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement of
the Consolidated Class Action. On June 1, 2015, the Court
preliminarily approved the proposed settlement of the Derivative
Actions pursuant to a proposed stipulated settlement agreement. On
August 3, 2015, the Court entered a Final Order and Judgment
resolving the Consolidated Class Action litigation in its entirety.
The Consolidated Class Action was thereby dismissed in its entirety
with prejudice and without costs. On August 10, 2015, pursuant to a
settlement by and between the Company and AmTrust North America,
AmTrust s lawsuit contesting insurance coverage of the
Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Actions was dismissed in
its entirety with prejudice pursuant to a Stipulation for Dismissal
of Entire Action with Prejudice executed by and between AmTrust and
the Company. On August 17, 2015, the Court entered a Final Order
and Judgment resolving the Derivative Actions in their entirety.
The Derivative Actions were thereby dismissed in their entirety
with prejudice. 

As a result of the foregoing, all litigation discussed herein is
resolved in full at this time. The Company issued $2 million in
common stock or 115,141,048 shares of the Company s common
stock on April 6, 2016 pursuant to the settlement of the
Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Action lawsuits alleging
violations of federal securities laws that were filed against the
Company in United States District Court, Central District of
California. The Company accrued $2,000,000 as loss on class action
lawsuits and contingent liabilities during the year ending December
31, 2015.

in sales tax and $59,892 in payroll and other taxes.

outstanding beyond their respective maturity dates. This may
trigger an event of default under the respective agreements. The
Company is working with these noteholders to convert their notes
into common stock and intends to resolve these outstanding issues
as soon as practicable. 

Other Legal Proceedings 

The Company is in default on its Portland, Maine store lease and
the Company is negotiating with the landlord. The Company has been
sued for non-payment of lease payments at closed stores in Boulder,

THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS 

GrowLife, Inc.
( GrowLife  or the  Company ) is
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is
headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. We were founded in 2012 with
the Closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with SGT Merger
Corporation. 

Our
goal of becoming the nation s largest cultivation facility
service provider for the production of organics, herbs and greens
and plant-based medicines continues to guide our decisions. Our
mission is to best serve more cultivators in the design, build-out,
expansion and maintenance of their facilities with products of high
quality, exceptional value and competitive price. Through
knowledgeable representatives, regional centers and its e-commerce
website, GrowLife provides essential and hard-to-find goods
including growing media, industry-leading hydroponics equipment,
organic plant nutrients, and thousands more products to specialty
grow operations across the United States. 

We
primarily sell through our wholly owned subsidiary, GrowLife
Hydroponics, Inc. GrowLife companies distribute and sell over
15,000 products through its e-commerce distribution channel,
GrowLifeEco.com, and through our regional retail storefronts.
GrowLife and its business units are organized and directed to
operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and
federal laws. 

29 

We are
focusing on future success. In that regard, we believe that the
hydroponics supply industry will experience significant growth and,
as a result, operating in this industry has become highly
competitive, cash intensive and customer centric.  However, we
have plans to address these challenges.   

First,
the opportunity to sell both infrastructure equipment and recurring
supplies to the indoor cultivation industry is constantly
increasing as demand for indoor cultivation grows across the United
States. We believe the demand will continue to grow and more and
more states and municipalities enact rules and regulations allowing
for more indoor cultivation activities.   We plan to continue
with our multi-faceted distribution strategy, which we believe
serves customers in the following manner: Direct sales to large
commercial customers, retail in some markets for local convenience,
and e-commerce via  GrowLifeEco.com  to
fulfill orders across the nation from customers of all sizes.

Second,
serving what we see as an increasing number of cultivators has
become cash intensive because of the need for large inventory
levels at retail, extensive e-commerce online marketing, and
supporting payment terms to large accounts.  We need to
arrange for financing support to be competitive.  We have
learned that retail success is about having the right products on
hand, knowledgeable and experienced talent, accessible advisory
services and superior turn-over ratios. 
Currently,  GrowLifeEco.com  offers
over 15,000 products, far beyond the 3,000 found in  Greners.com , its former online
store.   

Third,
our customers come in different stages from caregiver cultivators
to 80,000 square foot commercial operations.  With the use of
e-commerce, we endeavor to reach as many customers as possible in
areas where we do not have stores or a direct sales presence. 
Earlier this year GrowLife built  GrowLifeEco.com , our new
e-commerce website, that is optimized for mobile
devices.  Our next step is to put web marketing in place to
increase awareness, traffic and conversions.   

Also,
we recognize demand is increasing from small, aspiring cultivation
consumers across the country seeking to learn and use a complete
indoor growing solution.  To address this demand, we
packaged  GrowLife
Cube , a development-stage annual subscription service, for
consumers to get hands-on experience with indoor growing. 
Although many still buy the components separately, we are working
on developing videos and supplier tools to attract them to this
one-stop shop subscription program.  Given the election
results in California the GrowLife Cube subscription service will
evolve with greater value and specialty services to be announced in
the fourth quarter. 

Resumed Trading of our Common Stock 

On
February 18, 2016, our common stock resumed unsolicited quotation
on the OTC Bulletin Board after receiving clearance from the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) on
our Form 15c2-11. We are currently taking the appropriate steps to
uplist to the OTCQB Exchange and resume priced quotations with
market makers as soon as it is able. 

Market
Size and Growth 

Governing.com
reports that due to the recent elections, 28 states plus
Washington, DC have legalized cannabis for medical use and seven
states plus Washington, DC have passed recreational use into law.
 California s approved Prop. 64
Measure allows adults 21 and older to now to grow up to six plants
in their homes. This creates a sizable consumer indoor cultivation
market that was not available before. Governing.com s map
shows current state laws and recently approved ballot measures
legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. Medical
marijuana laws recently passing in Arkansas, Florida and North
Dakota have yet to become effective. Laws permitting recreational
use in Massachusetts and Nevada have also not yet been implemented
after receiving voter approval. This Information is current as of
November 9, 2016.  

30 

As the
states across the country approve medicinal cannabis usage, with
different THC and CBD compositions, and similar indoor growing
supply companies. Therefore, as the cannabis market grows so does
the revenue growth opportunity for us. Researchers from
 The ArcView Group , report
the legal marijuana market totaled $5.4 billion in sales in 2015,
and on pace to grow to $6.7 billion in 2016. ArcView also believes
the legal marijuana industry could grow at a compound annual rate
of 30% through 2020. 

More
important, GrowLife serves a new, yet sophisticated community of
commercial and urban cultivators growing specialty crops including
organics, greens and plant-based medicines. Unlike the traditional
agricultural industry, these cultivators use innovative indoor
growing techniques to produce specialty crops in highly controlled
environments. This enables them to produce crops at higher yields
without having to compromise quality - regardless of the season or
weather and drought conditions. 

Indoor
growing is commonly used for plant-based medicines because they
often require high-degree of regulation and controls including
government compliance, security, and crop consistency. This makes
indoor growing a preferred method. Cultivators of plant-based
medicines often make a significant investment to design and
build-out their facilities. They look to work with companies such
as GrowLife who understand their specific needs, and can help
mitigate risks that could jeopardize their crops. 

Indoor
growing techniques, however, are not limited to plant-based
medicines. Vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables
are beginning to emerge in the market due to a rising shortage of
farmland, and environmental vulnerabilities including drought,
other severe weather conditions and insect pests. Indoor growing
techniques enables cultivators to grow crops all-year-round in
urban areas, and take up less ground while minimizing environmental
risks. Indoor growing techniques typically require a more
significant upfront investment to design and build-out these
facilities, than traditional farmlands. If new innovations lower
the costs for indoor growing, and the costs to operate traditional
farmlands continue to rise, then indoor growing techniques may be a
compelling alternative for the broader agricultural
industry. 

Strategy 

Our
goal is to become the nation s largest cultivation facility
service provider for the production of organics, herbs and greens
and plant-based medicines. We intend to achieve our goal by (i)
expanding our nationwide, multi-channel sales network presence,
(ii) offering the best terms for the full range of build-out
equipment and consumable supplies, and (iii) deliver superior,
innovative products exclusively. 

First,
we provide distribution through retail, e-commerce and direct sales
to have national coverage and serve cultivators of all sizes. Each
channel offers varying pricing for differing benefits. Retail sells
at list price by offering inventory convenience, e-commerce
provides the lowest price without requiring local inventory, and
direct sales delivers the best bid price for high-volume
purchasers. Additional points of service may be added through
existing distribution locations and services. This may be done in
several manners and programs that may incorporate
cultivator-centric locations with other retailers. 

Second,
we serve the needs of all size cultivators and each one s
unique formulation, or  recipe . We provide thousands
of varieties of supplies from dozens of vendors and distributors.
More importantly is our experience of knowing which products to
recommend under each customer s circumstance. Growing
operations seeking expansion may also qualify for leasing terms by
one of our financing partner. 

And
third, our experience with hundreds of customers allows us to
determine specific product needs and sources to test new designs.
Lights, pesticides, nutrients, extraction and growing systems are
some examples of products that GrowLife has obtained exclusive
access to purchase and distribute. Popular name branded products
are seeking to be part of the GrowLife company in many forms. In
exchange, we can market their products in a unique manner over
generic products. 

Our
company can expand with these strategies until it serves all the
indoor cultivators throughout the country. Once a customer is
engaged, we will gradually expand their purchasing market share by
providing greater economic benefit to the customers who buy more
products from GrowLife than from other suppliers. 

Key
Market Priorities 

Demand
for indoor growing equipment is increasing due to legalization of
plant-based medicines, primarily cannabis, which is mainly due to
equipment purchases for build-out and repeated consumables. This
demand is projected to continue to grow as a result of the
supporting state laws in 28 states and the District of Columbia.
Continued innovation in more efficient build-out technologies along
with larger and consolidated cultivation facilities will further
expand market demand for our products and services. 

We
expect for the market to continue to segment into urban farmers
serving groups of individuals, community cultivators, and
large-scale cultivation facilities across the states. Each segment
will be optimized to different distribution channels that we
currently provide. Our volume purchasing will allow us to obtain
the best prices and maximize both our revenues and gross
margins. 

The
nature of the cannabis industry s inefficiencies due to the
lack of interstate commerce imposed by the Federal government has
segmented the market opportunities by State laws, population and
demand. Currently, Colorado laws and population demand make it the
most progressive and top market in the industry. We have elected to
have a major retail presence in Colorado with our direct sales team
and centralized our national e-commerce operations. California is
expected to surpass Colorado and GrowLife expects to establish a
major presence in the state. We are currently reaching most of the
legal states using both direct sales and seek to introduce
 GrowLife eco  products to
other hydroponic and gardening retailers. 

31 

Employees 

As of
 September 30,  2016, we had one
full-time employee and one consultant at our Seattle, Washington
office. Marco Hegyi, our Chief Executive Officer, is based in
Kirkland0, Washington. Mark E. Scott, our consulting CFO, is based
out of in Seattle, Washington. In addition, we have 7 employees
located throughout the United States who operate our e-commerce,
direct sales and retail businesses. None of our employees is
subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a
trade or labor union. We believe that we have a good relationship
with our employees. 

Key
Partners 

Our key
customers varying by state and are expected to be more defined as
the company moves from its retail walk-in purchasing sales strategy
to serving cultivation facilities directly and under predictable
purchasing contracts.   

Our key
suppliers include distributors such as HydroFarm, Urban
Horticultural Supply and Sunlight Supply to product-specific
suppliers. All the products purchased and resold are applicable to
indoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based
medicines. 

Competition 

Certain
large commercial cultivators have found themselves willing to
assume their own equipment support by buying large volume purchased
directly from certain suppliers and distributors such as Sunlight
Supplies, HydroFarm, and UHS. Other key competitors on the retail
side consist of local and regional hydroponic resellers of indoor
growing equipment. On the e-commerce business, GrowersHouse.com,
Hydrobuilder.com, HorticultureSource.com and smaller online
resellers using Amazon and eBay e-commerce market
systems. 

Intellectual
Property and Proprietary Rights 

Our
intellectual property consists of brands and their related
trademarks and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product
know-how and technology, and marketing intangibles. 

Our
other intellectual property is primarily in the form of trademarks
and domain names. We also hold rights to more than a dozen website
addresses related to our business including websites that are
actively used in our day-to-day business such as  www.growlifeinc.com ,
 www.growlifeeco.com  and
 www.greners.com . 

We have
a policy of entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure
agreements with our employees and some of our vendors and customers
as necessary. 

Government
Regulation 

Currently, there
are twenty-eight states plus the District of Columbia that have
laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another
legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis
in connection with medical treatment. There are currently seven
states that allow recreational use of cannabis. As of the date of
this writing, the policy and regulations of the Federal government
and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a
range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for
personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or
may not be permitted on the basis of state law. Active enforcement
of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a
regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the
willingness of customers of GrowLife to invest in or buy products
from GrowLife. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory
position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect
revenues and profits of the GrowLife companies. 

All
this being said, many reports show that the majority of the
American public is in favor of making medical cannabis available as
a controlled substance to those patients who need it. The need and
consumption will then require cultivators to continue to provide
safe and compliant crops to consumers. The cultivators will then
need to build facilities and use consumable products, which
GrowLife provides. 

THE COMPANY S COMMON STOCK 

Our common stock traded on the grey market under the symbol
 PHOT  through February 17, 2016. While the company was

reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail markup, markdown or
commission, and may not represent actual transactions.
Consequently, the information provided below was not be indicative
of our common stock price under different conditions.

uplist to the OTCQB Exchange and resume priced quotations with
market makers as soon as it is able. 

32 

PRIMARY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 

We are
exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, our need for
additional financing, the sale of significant numbers of our
shares, the potential adjustment in the exercise price of our
convertible debentures and a volatile market price for our common
stock. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail
below in Part II, Item 1A.

months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was due to (i) lower
revenue  from the retail stores acquired by GrowLife
Hydroponics  acquisition of Rocky Mountain Hydroponics and
Evergreen Garden Center on September 7, 2013; (ii) closure of the
unprofitable Peabody, Massachusetts, Woodland Hills, California and
Plaistow, New Hampshire stores; and (iii) lack of liquidity. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we transitioned funding
from TCA funding to Chicago Venture. During the transition, we
experienced difficulties in purchasing product and lost or canceled
sales. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
decreased $1,800,000 to $893,000 as compared to $2,693,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was due to (i)
lower revenue  from the retail stores acquired by GrowLife
Hydroponics  acquisition of Rocky Mountain Hydroponics and
Evergreen Garden Center on September 7, 2013; (ii) closure of the
unprofitable Peabody, Massachusetts, Woodland Hills, California and
Plaistow, New Hampshire stores; and (iii) lack of liquidity. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we transitioned funding
from TCA funding to Chicago Venture. During the transition, we
experienced difficulties in purchasing product and ordered product
at higher costs and lost or canceled sales. 

Gross profit was $36,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to $430,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The gross margin was 3.9% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to 14.8% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.  During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we transitioned funding from TCA funding to Chicago
Venture. During the transition, we experienced difficulties in
purchasing product and ordered product at higher costs and lost or
canceled sales.

General and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 decreased $831,000 to $1,351,000 as compared to $2,182,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was due to
(i) reduced legal expense of $78,000; (ii) reduced wages of
$308,000; (iii) reduced insurance expense of $175,000; (iv) reduced
consulting expenses of $112,000; (v) reduced auditing of $57,000
and (vi) reduced other general expenses of $101,000. As part of the
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we did not record any public relation, investor
relation or business development expenses. 

Non-cash
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was  $310,000
including (i)  depreciation and amortization of
$8 7,000 ; (ii) stock based
compensation of $ 98,000  related
to stock option grants; (iii) common stock issued for services of
$ 125,000.  

Non-cash
general and administrative expenses for the  nine months ended September 30, 2015  was
$230,000, with (i) depreciation and amortization of $91,000; and
(ii) stock based compensation of $139,000 related to stock option
grants. 

Other Income/ Expense 

Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
$424,000 as compared to other expense of $1,714,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The other expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 included interest expense of
$614,000 and loss on debt conversions of $464,000, offset by change
in derivative liability of $497,000 and other income of $157,000.
The change in derivative liability is the non-cash change in the
fair value and relates to our derivative instruments. The non-cash
interest  related to the amortization of the debt discount
associated with our convertible notes and accrued interest expense
related to our notes payable. The loss on debt conversions related
to the conversion of our notes payable at prices below the market
price. 

The other expense for the nine months ended September 30,
2015   included change in
derivative liability of $1,796,000, offset by interest expense of
$952,000, other expense of $477,000 and loss on class action
lawsuit settlements of $2,081,000. The change in derivative
liability is the non-cash change in the fair value and relates to
our derivative instruments. The non-cash interest  related to
the amortization of the debt discount associated with our
convertible notes, accrued interest expense related to our notes
payable.  We accrued $2,081,000 as loss
on class action lawsuits and contingent liabilities as of September
30, 2015. The other expense is primarily related to the TCA
funding.  

Net (Loss) 

Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
$1,739,000 as compared to a net loss of $3,466,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 for the reasons discussed
above. 

Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 
included  non-cash expense of $502,000
including (i)  depreciation and amortization of
$8 7,000 ; (ii) stock based
compensation of $ 98,000  related
to stock option grants; (iii) common stock issued for services of
$ 125,000 ; (iv) accrued interest
and amortization of debt discount on convertible notes payable of
$223,000; (v) loss on debt conversions of $464,000; and (vi)
 change in derivative liability of
$497,000.  

Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 
included  non-cash expense of
$1,712,000, including (i)  depreciation and amortization of
$91,000; (ii) stock based compensation of $139,000 related to stock
option grants; (iii)  interest expense
of $754,000, (iv) loss on class action lawsuit settlements of
$2,000,000; (v) preferred shares issued for services of $300,000;
and (v) other of $23,000, offset by (iv) change in derivative
liability of $1,595,000.  

We expect losses to continue as we implement our business
plan. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We had cash of $77,000 and a net working capital deficit of
approximately $4,294,000 (excluding the derivative liability-
warrants of $880,000 as of September 30, 2016.  We expect
losses to continue as we grow our business. Our cash used in
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the
years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $888,000, $1,376,000 and
$2,123,000, respectively. 

36 

Shortly
after the SEC suspended trading of our securities on April 10,
2014, some of our primary suppliers rescinded our credit terms and
required us to pay cash for our product purchases and pay down our
outstanding balance with these suppliers. 

We will need to obtain additional financing in the future. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to secure funding, or that
if such funding is available, the terms or conditions would be
acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing,
we may need to restructure our operations, divest all or a portion
of our business or file for bankruptcy. 

We have financed our operations through the issuance of convertible
debentures and the sale of common stock. 

Funding from Chicago Venture Partners, L.P. 

Entry into Securities Purchase Agreement with Chicago Venture
Partners, L.P.  As of April 4, 2016, we entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement and Convertible Promissory Note (the
 Chicago Venture Note ) with Chicago Venture, whereby
we agreed to sell, and Chicago Venture agreed to purchase an
unsecured convertible promissory note in the original principal
amount of $2,755,000. In connection with the transaction, we
received $350,000 in cash as well as a series of twelve Secured
Investor Notes for a total Purchase Price of $2,500,000. The Note
carries an Original Issue Discount ( OID ) of $250,000
and we agreed to pay $5,000 to cover Purchaser s legal fees,
accounting costs and other transaction expenses. 

The
Secured Investor Notes are payable (i) $50,000 upon filing of a
Registration Statement on Form S-1; (ii) $100,000 upon
effectiveness of the Registration Statement; and (iii) up to
$200,000 per month over the 10 months following effectiveness at
our sole discretion, subject to certain conditions. We agreed to
file the Registration Statement within forty-five (45) days of the
Closing and agreed to register shares of our common stock for the
benefit of Chicago Venture in exchange for the payments under the
Secured Investor Notes. 

Chicago
Venture has the option to convert the Note at 65% of the average of
the three (3) lowest volume weighted average prices in the twenty
(20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable conversion
(the  Conversion Price ). However, in no event will the
Conversion Price be less than $0.02 or greater than $0.09. In
addition, beginning on the date that is the earlier of six (6)
months or five (5) days after the Registration Statement becomes
effective, and on the same day of each month thereafter, the
Company will re-pay the Note in monthly installments in cash, or,
subject to certain Equity Conditions, in our common stock at 65% of
the average of the three (3) lowest volume weighted average prices
in the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the
applicable conversion (the  Installment Conversion
Price ). 

As
discussed above, once effective, we have the discretion to require
Chicago Venture to sell to us up to $200,000 per month over the
next 10 months on the above terms. We would then have the option to
issue shares registered under this Registration Statement to
Chicago Venture. Through this prospectus, the selling stockholder
may offer to the public for resale shares of our common stock that
we may issue to Chicago Venture pursuant to the Chicago Venture
Note. 

For a
period of no more than 36 months from the effective date of the
Registration Statement, we may, from time to time, at our sole
discretion, and subject to certain conditions that we must satisfy,
draw down funds under the Chicago Venture Note. 

Our
ability to require Chicago Venture to fund the Chicago Venture Note
is at our discretion, subject to certain limitations. Chicago
Venture is obligated to fund if each of the following conditions
are met; (i) the average and median daily dollar volumes of our
common stock for the twenty (20) and sixty (60) trading days
immediately preceding the funding date are greater than $100,000;
(ii) our market capitalization on the funding date is greater than
$17,000,000; (iii) we are not in default with respect to share
delivery obligations under the note as of the funding date; and
(iv) we are current in its reporting obligations. Chicago
Venture  obligations under the equity line are not
transferable. 

The
issuance of our common stock under the Chicago Venture Note will
have no effect on the rights or privileges of existing holders of
common stock except that the economic and voting interests of each
stockholder will be diluted as a result of any such issuance.
Although the number of shares of common stock that stockholders
presently own will not decrease, these shares will represent a
smaller percentage of our total shares that will be outstanding
after any issuances of shares of common stock to Chicago Venture.
If we draw down amounts under the Chicago Venture Note when our
share price is decreasing, we will need to issue more shares to
repay the same amount than if our stock price was higher. Such
issuances will have a dilutive effect and may further decrease our
stock price. 

There
is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the foregoing
conditions or any other conditions under the Securities Purchase
Agreement and/or Chicago Venture Note or that we will be able to
draw down any portion of the amounts available under the Securities
Purchase Agreement and/or Chicago Venture Note. However, we do
believe there is a strong likelihood, as long as we can meet the
various conditions to funding, that we will receive the full amount
of funding under the equity line of credit. Given our financial
challenges and the competitive nature of our business, we also
believe we will need the full amount of funding under the equity
line of credit in order to fully realize our business
plans. 

37 

A
portion of the funds received from Chicago Venture will be used to
pay off TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP ( TCA ), a
previous equity financing partner and a portion will be invested in
our business. Specifically, we anticipate that approximately
$1,400,000 is expected to be used to pay TCA and the remaining
funds, if any, will be used for general business purposes such as
marketing, product development, expansion and administrative costs.
We are not aware of any relationship between TCA and Chicago
Venture. We have had no previous transactions with Chicago Venture
or any of Chicago Venture  affiliates. We cannot predict
whether the Chicago Venture transaction will have either a positive
or negative impact on our stock price. However, in addition to the
fact that each Chicago Venture conversion, when and if it occurs,
has a dilutive effect on our stock, that should Chicago Venture
convert large portions of the debt into registered shares and then
sells those shares on the market, that our stock price could be
depressed. 

Debt Purchase Agreement and First Amendment to Debt Purchase
Agreement and Note Assignment Agreement.   On August 24, 2016, we closed a Debt Purchase
Agreement and a First Amendment to Debt Purchase Agreement and
related agreements with Chicago Venture and
TCA.  

On August 24, 2016, TCA closed an Assignment of Note Agreement and
related agreements with Chicago Venture. The referenced agreements
relate to the assignment of Company debt, in the form of
debentures, by TCA to Chicago Venture. The Company was a party to
the agreements between TCA and Chicago Venture because the Company
is the  borrower  under the TCA held
debentures. 

Exchange Agreement, Convertible Promissory Note and related
Agreements with Chicago Venture.   On August 17, 2016, we closed an Exchange
Agreement and a Convertible Promissory Note and related agreements
with Chicago Venture whereby we agreed to the assignment of
debentures representing debt between the Company, on the one hand,
and with  TCA, on the other hand. Specifically, we agreed
that TCA could assign a portion of the Company s debt held by
TCA to Chicago Venture. 

According
to the Exchange Agreement, the debt is to be assigned in tranches,
with the first tranche of debt assigned from TCA to Chicago Venture
being $128,000 which is represented by an Initial Exchange Note as
defined in the Exchange Agreement. 

Funding from TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP
( TCA ). 

The First TCA SPA .  On July 9,
2015, we closed a Securities Purchase Agreement and related
agreements with  TCA Global Credit Master Fund LP
( TCA ),  an accredited
investor, whereby we agreed to sell and TCA agreed to purchase up
to $3,000,000     of
senior secured convertible, redeemable debentures, of which
$700,000 was purchased on July 9, 2015 and up to $2,300,000 may be
purchased in additional closings. The closing of the transaction
(the  First TCA SPA ) occurred on July 9, 2015.
Effective as of May 4, 2016, the Company and TCA entered into a
First Amendment to the First TCA SPA whereby the parties agreed to
amend the terms of the First TCA SPA in exchange for TCA s
forbearance of existing defaults by the
Company.  

The Second TCA SPA  . On August
6, 2015, we closed a second Securities Purchase Agreement and
related agreements with  TCA  whereby we agreed to sell and TCA agreed to
purchase a $100,000 senior secured convertible redeemable debenture
and we agreed to issue and sell to TCA, from time to time, and TCA
agreed to purchase from us up to $3,000,000 of the Company s
common stock pursuant to a committed equity facility. The closing
of the transaction (the  Second TCA SPA ) occurred on
August 6, 2015. On April 11, 2016, we agreed with TCA to mutually
terminate the Second TCA SPA.  

Amendment to the First TCA SPA . On October 27, 2015, we
entered into an Amended and Restated Securities Purchase Agreement
and related agreements with TCA whereby we agreed to sell, and TCA
agreed to purchase $350,000 of senior secured convertible,
redeemable debentures. This was an amendment to the First TCA SPA
(the  Amendment to the First TCA SPA .) As of October
27, 2015, we sold $1,050,000 in Debentures to TCA and up to
$1,950,000 in Debentures remain for sale by us. The closing of the
Amendment to the First TCA SPA occurred on October 27, 2015. In
addition, TCA has advanced us an additional $100,000 for a total of
$1,150.000. 

Issuance of Preferred Stock to TCA . Also, on October 21,
2015 we issued 150,000 Series B Preferred Stock at a stated value
equal to $10.00 per share to TCA.  The
Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into common stock by
dividing the stated value of the shares being converted by 100% of
the average of the five (5) lowest closing bid prices for the
common stock during the ten (10) consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the conversion date as quoted by Bloomberg,
LP.  On October 21, 2015, we also issued 51 shares of Series
C Preferred Stock at $0.0001 par value per share to TCA. The Series
C Preferred Stock is not convertible into our common stock.
 In the event of a default under the
Amended and Restated TCA Transaction Documents, TCA can exercise
voting control over our common stock with their Series C Preferred
Stock voting rights.  

38 

TCA s Forbearance  . Due to
our default on its repayment obligations under the TCA SPA s
and related documents, the parties agreed to restructure the
SPA s whereby TCA agreed to forbear from enforcement of our
defaults and to restructure a payment schedule for repayment of
debt under the SPAs. We defaulted because our operating results
were not as expected and we were unable to generate sufficient
revenue through its business operations to serve the TCA debt.
Specifically, the First Amendment to Amended and Restated
Securities Purchase Agreement made the following material
modifications to the existing SPA s:  

All
unpaid debentures were modified as described in more detail
below. 

Payments
on the debentures shall be made by (i) debt purchase agreement(s)
to be entered into by TCA, (ii) through proceeds raised from the
transaction(s) with Chicago Venture; or (iii) by the Company
directly. 

The
due date of the debentures was extended to April 28,
2018. 

TCA
agreed that it shall not enforce and shall forbear from pursuing
enforcement of any existing defaults by us unless and until a
future Company default occurs. 

In furtherance of TCA s forbearance, effective as of May 4,
2016, we issued Second Replacement Debenture A in the principal
amount of $150,000 and Second Replacement Debenture B in the
principal amount of $2,681,209.82 (collectively, the  Second
Replacement Debentures ). 

Per the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Second Replacement Debentures were combined, and
apportioned into two separate replacement debentures. The Second
Replacement Debentures were intended to act in substitution for and
to supersede the debentures in their entirety. It was the intent of
the Company and TCA that while the Second Replacement Debentures
replace and supersede the debentures, in their entirety, they were
not in payment or satisfaction of the debentures, but rather were
the substitute of one evidence of debt for another without any
intent to extinguish the old debt. The maximum number of shares
subject to conversion under the Second Replacement Debentures is
383,028,714. This is an approximation. The estimation of the
maximum number of shares issuable upon the conversion of the Second
Replacement Debentures was calculated  using an estimated
average price of $.013 per share. 

The Second Replacement Debentures contemplate TCA entering into
debt purchase agreement(s) with third parties whereby TCA may, at
its election, sever, split, divide or apportion the Second
Replacement Debentures to accomplish the repayment of the balance
owed to TCA by Company. The Second Replacement Debentures are
convertible at 85% of the lowest daily volume weighted average
price ( VWAP ) of our common stock during the five (5)
business days immediately prior to a conversion date. 

In connection with the above agreements, the parties acknowledged
and agreed that certain advisory fees previously paid to TCA as
provided in the SPAs in the amount of $1,500,000 have been added
and included within the principal balance of the Second Replacement
Debentures. The advisory fees related too financial, merger and
acquisition and regulatory services provided to us. The conversion
price discount on the Second Replacement Debentures will not apply
to the advisory fees added to the Second Replacement Debentures.
TCA also agreed to surrender its Series B Preferred Stock in
exchange for the $1,500,000 being added to the Second Replacement
Debenture. 

As more
particularly described below, we remain in debt to TCA for the
principal amount of $1,500,000. The remaining $1,400,000 of
principal debt was assigned to Old Main Capital, LLC (see
discussion immediately below.) We intend to use the funds generated
from the Chicago Venture transaction to fuel its business
operations and business plans which, in turn, will presumably
generate revenues sufficient to avoid another default in the
remaining TCA obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient
funds through the Chicago Venture transaction and/or generate sales
sufficient to service the remaining TCA debt then we will be unable
to avoid another default. Failure to operate in accordance with the
various agreements with TCA could result in the cancellation of
these agreements, result in foreclosure on our assets in an event
of default which would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial
condition. 

TCA Assignment of Debt to Old Main Capital, LLC 

On September 9, 2016, we closed a Debt Purchase Agreement and
related agreements (the  Old Main Transaction
Documents ) with TCA and Old Main Capital, LLC ( Old
Main ) whereby TCA agreed to sell and Old Main agreed to
purchase in multiple tranches $1,400,000 in senior secured
convertible, redeemable debentures (the  Assigned
Debt ) (the  Old Main Transaction ). The Assigned
Debt was our debt incurred in the TCA financing transactions that
closed in 2015. We were required to execute the Old Main
Transaction Documents as we are the  borrower  on the
Assigned Debt. 

Debt Purchase Agreement.   As set
forth above, we entered into the Debt Purchase Agreement on
September 9, 2015 with TCA and Old Main whereby Old Main agreed to
purchase, in tranches, $1,400,000 of debt previously held by TCA.
We executed the Debt Purchase Agreement as it was the
 borrower  under the Assigned Debt and was required to
make certain representations and warranties regarding the Assigned
Debt. The Assigned Debt is represented by a new  10% Senior
Convertible Promissory Note  entered into by and between Old
Main and the Company (more particularly described
below.)  

39 

Exchange Agreement.   In
conjunction with the Debt Purchase Agreement, on September 9, 2016,
we entered into an Exchange Agreement whereby we agreed to
exchange, in tranches, the Assigned Debt, as well as any amendments
thereto, with a 10% Senior Convertible Promissory Note (the
 Note )     having
a principal balance of $1,400,000. The closing dates for the
exchanges, scheduled to occur in tranches, are set forth in
Schedule 1 attached to the Exchange Agreement.  

10% Senior Convertible Promissory Note.   Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we entered
into a 10% Senior Convertible Promissory Note dated September 9,
2016 with Old Main whereby the Company agreed to be indebted to Old
Main for the Assigned Debt. We promised to pay Old Main, by no
later than the maturity date of September 9, 2017 the outstanding
principal of the Assigned Debt together with interest on the
outstanding principal amount under the Note, at the rate of ten
percent (10%) per annum simple interest.  

At any time after September 9, 2016, and while the Note is still
outstanding and at the sole option of Old Main, Old Main may
convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal, accrued
and unpaid interest redemption premium and any other sums due and
payable hereunder or under any of the other Transaction Documents
into shares of our Common Stock at a price equal to the lower of:
(i) sixty-five percent (65%) of the lowest traded price of the
Company s Common Stock during the thirty (30) trading days
prior to the Conversion Date; or (ii) sixty-five percent (65%) of
the lowest traded price of the Common Stock in the thirty (30)
Trading Days prior to the Closing Date. 

Option Agreement.   In connection
with the Old Main Transaction Documents, TCA and Old Main entered
into an Option Agreement dated September 8, 2016 whereby TCA agreed
to grant Old Main an option to purchase the Assigned Debt, or any
portion thereof, under the terms and conditions of the Debt
Purchase Agreement. In consideration, Old Main agreed to pay the
Option Payment as more particularly described in the Option
Agreement.  

On August 24, 2016, TCA terminated its Debt Purchase Agreement and
related agreements with Old Main. The specific termination date is
September 25, 2016, and Old Main had a right to purchase an
additional $300,000 in debt from TCA. 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $888,000. This amount was primarily related
to a net loss of $1,739,000, offset by an increase in inventory of
$79,000 an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of
$271,000 and non-cash expenses of $502,000 including (i) 
depreciation and amortization of $8 7,000 ; (ii) stock based compensation of
$ 98,000  related to stock option
grants; (iii) common stock issued for services of $ 125,000 ; (iv) accrued interest and
amortization of debt discount on convertible notes payable of
$223,000; (v) loss on debt conversions of $464,000; and (vi)
 change in derivative liability of
$497,000.  

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $905,000. The amount related to funding
provided by Chicago Venture. 

Our contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2016 are
summarized in the table below: 

40 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We do
not have any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is
defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K) that are reasonably likely
to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources. 

ITEM 3. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK. 

This item is not applicable.  

ITEM 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term
 disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), means controls
and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
company's management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive and principal financial officers concluded as of
September 30, 2016 that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material
weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting
discussed immediately below. 

Identified
Material Weakness 

A
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies,
that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or
detected. 

Management
identified the following material weakness during its assessment of
internal controls over financial reporting: 

Audit Committee : 

On
September 3, 2014, we formed an Audit Committee and appointed an
 audit committee financial expert as
defined by SEC and as adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002.  Prior to this, we did not have an Audit Committee to
oversee financial reporting and used  external service providers to ensure compliance
with the SEC requirements. The current Audit Committee has one
management director. Subsequent to the year ended December 31,
2015, Mr. Fasci was appointed as Secretary of the Company and is no
longer deemed independent under this standard.  

Other Weaknesses: 

Our
information systems lack sufficient controls limiting access to key
applications and data. 

Our
inventory system lacked standardized product descriptions and
effective controls to ensure the accuracy, valuation, and
timeliness of the financial accounting process around inventory,
including a lack of accuracy and basis for valuation resulting in
adjustments to the amount of cost of revenues and the carrying
amount of inventory. 

b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

During
the quarter ended  September 30,
2016 , there were no changes in our internal controls over
financial reporting during this fiscal quarter that materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to have a materially affect, on
our internal control over financial reporting. 

41 

PART II.     OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings. 

We are
involved in the disputes and legal proceedings described below. In
addition, as a public company, we are also potentially susceptible
to litigation, such as claims asserting violations of securities
laws. Any such claims, with or without merit, if not resolved,
could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. We accrue
any contingent liabilities that are likely. 

Class Actions Alleging Violations of Federal Securities
Laws 

Beginning on April 18, 2014, three class action lawsuits alleging
violations of federal securities laws were filed against the
Company in United States District Court, Central District of
California (the  Court ). At a hearing held on July 21,
2014, the three class action lawsuits were consolidated into one
case with Lawrence Rosen as the lead plaintiff (the
 Consolidated Class Action,  styled Romero et al. vs.
GrowLife et al.). On May 15, 2014 and August 4, 2014, respectively
two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against the Company
with the Court (the  Derivative Actions ). On October
20, 2014, AmTrust North America, our insurer, filed a lawsuit
contesting insurance coverage on the above legal proceedings. We
made a general appearance in this action. On September 1, 2015, the
Court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement of the
Derivative Actions pursuant to a proposed stipulated settlement
agreement. On August 3, 2015, the Court entered a Final Order and
Judgment resolving the Consolidated Class Action litigation in its
entirety. The Consolidated Class Action was thereby dismissed in
its entirety with prejudice and without costs. On August 10, 2015,
pursuant to a settlement by and between the Company and AmTrust
North America, AmTrust s lawsuit contesting insurance
coverage of the Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Actions
was dismissed in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to a
Stipulation for Dismissal of Entire Action with Prejudice executed
by and between AmTrust and the Company. On August 17, 2015, the
Court entered a Final Order and Judgment resolving the Derivative
Actions in their entirety. The Derivative Actions were thereby
dismissed in their entirety with prejudice. We issued $2 million in
common stock or 115,141,048 shares of the Company s common
stock on April 6, 2016 pursuant to the settlement of the
Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Action lawsuits alleging
violations of federal securities laws that were filed against the
Company in United States District Court, Central District of
California. We accrued $2,000,000 as loss on class action lawsuits
and contingent liabilities during the year ending December 31,
2015. 

Sales, Payroll and Other Tax Liabilities 

As of September 30, 2016, we owe approximately $118,900 in sales
tax and $59,892 in payroll and other taxes. 

Potential Convertible Note Defaults 

Several of our convertible promissory notes remain outstanding
beyond their respective maturity dates. This may trigger an event
of default under the respective agreements. We are working with
these noteholders to convert their notes into common stock and
intends to resolve these outstanding issues as soon as
practicable. 

Other Legal Proceedings 

We are in default on our Portland, Maine store lease and we are
negotiating with the landlord. We have been sued for non-payment of
lease payments at closed stores in Boulder, Colorado and Plaistow,
New Hampshire. We are currently subject to legal actions with
various vendors and a former officer. 

It is
possible that additional lawsuits may be filed and served on the
Company. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

Suspension of trading of the Company s
securities. 

On
April 10, 2014, we received notice from the SEC that trading of our
common stock on the OTCBB was to be suspended from April 10, 2014
through April 24, 2014. The SEC issued its order pursuant to
Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. According to
the notice received by us from the SEC:  It appears to the
Securities and Exchange Commission that the public interest and the
protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the
securities of GrowLife, Inc. because of concerns regarding the
accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace and
potentially manipulative transactions in GrowLife s common
stock.  To date, we have not received notice from the SEC
that it is being formally investigated. 

42 

On
February 18, 2016, our common stock resumed unsolicited quotation
on the OTC Bulletin Board after receiving clearance from the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) on
our Form 15c2-11. We are currently taking the appropriate steps to
uplist to the OTCQB Exchange and resume priced quotations with
market makers as soon as it is able. 

The
suspension of trading eliminated our market makers, resulted in our
trading on the grey sheets, resulted in legal proceedings and
restricted our access to capital. This action had a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when it
is needed, we will need to restructure our operations, and divest
all or a portion of our business. 

SEC charges outsiders with manipulating our
securities. 

On
August 5, 2014, the SEC charged four promoters with ties to the
Pacific Northwest for manipulating our securities. The SEC alleged
that the four promoters bought inexpensive shares of thinly traded
penny stock companies on the open market and conducted
pre-arranged, manipulative matched orders and wash trades to create
the illusion of an active market in these stocks.  They then
sold their shares in coordination with aggressive third party
promotional campaigns that urged investors to buy the stocks
because the prices were on the verge of rising substantially. 
This action has had a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to
obtain additional financing when it is needed, we will need to
restructure our operations, and divest all or a portion of our
business. 

On July
9, 2015, the SEC entered into settlements with two of the
promoters. In connection with the settlement of their SEC action,
the two men are liable for disgorgement of approximately $2.1
million and $306,000 in illicit profits, respectively. Earlier this
year the two men were also sentenced to five and three years in
prison, respectively, for their participation in the
scheme. 

We are involved in Legal Proceedings. 

We are
involved in the disputes and legal proceedings as discussed in this
prospectus. In addition, as a public company, we are also
potentially susceptible to litigation, such as claims asserting
violations of securities laws. Any such claims, with or without
merit, if not resolved, could be time-consuming and result in
costly litigation. There can be no assurance that an adverse result
in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material
adverse on our business, results of operations or financial
condition. 

Our Joint Venture Agreement with CANX USA, LLC is important to our
operations. 

On July
10, 2014, we closed a Waiver and Modification Agreement, Amended
and Restated Joint Venture Agreement, Secured Credit Facility and
Secured Convertible Note with CANX, and Logic Works LLC, a lender
and shareholder of the Company. The Agreements require the filing
of a registration statement on Form S-1 within 10 days of the
filing of our Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2014.
Due to our grey sheet trading status and other issues, we did not
file the registration statement. 

Previously,
we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with CANX USA LLC, a
Nevada limited liability company.  Under the terms of the
Joint Venture Agreement, the Company and CANX formed Organic Growth
International, LLC ( OGI ), a Nevada limited liability
company, for the purpose of expanding the Company s
operations in its current retail hydroponic businesses and in other
synergistic business verticals and facilitating additional funding
for commercially financeable transactions of up to
$40,000,000.  In connection with the closing of the
Agreement, CANX agreed to provide a commitment for funding in the
amount of $1,300,000 for a GrowLife Infrastructure Funding
Technology program transaction and provided additional funding
under a 7% Convertible Note instrument for $1,000,000, including
$500,000 each from Logic Works and China West III Investments LLC,
entities that are unaffiliated with CANX and operate as separate
legal entities. We initially owned a non-dilutive 45% share of OGI
and we may acquire a controlling share of OGI as provided in the
Joint Venture Agreement. In accordance with the Joint Venture
Agreement, the Company and CANX entered into a Warrant Agreement
whereby the Company delivered to CANX a warrant to purchase
140,000,000 shares of the Company common stock at a maximum strike
price of $0.033 per share. Also in accordance with the Joint
Venture Agreement, we issued an additional warrant to purchase
100,000,000 shares of our common stock at a maximum strike price of
$0.033 per share on February 7, 2014. 

On
April 10, 2014, as a result of the suspension in the trading of our
securities, we went into default on our 7% Convertible Notes
Payable for $500,000 each from Logic Works and China West III. As a
result, we accrued interest on these notes at the default rate of
24% per annum. Furthermore, as a result of being in default on
these notes, the Holders could have, at their sole discretion,
called these notes. 

Waiver and Modification Agreement 

We
entered into a Waiver and Modification Agreement dated September
25, 2014 with Logic Works LLC whereby the 7% Convertible Note with
Logic Works dated December 20, 2013 was modified to provide for (i)
a waiver of the default under the 7% Convertible Note; (ii) a
conversion price which is the lesser of (A) $0.025 or (B) twenty
percent (20%) of the average of the three (3) lowest daily VWAPs
occurring during the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days
immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date on which the
Holder elects to convert all or part of this Note; (iii) the filing
of a registration statement on Form S-1 within 10 days of the
filing of the Company s Form 10-Q for the period ended
September 30, 2014; and (iv) continuing interest of 24% per annum.
China West III converted its Note into common stock on September 4,
2014. Due to our grey sheet trading status and other issues, we did
not file the registration statement. 

43 

Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement 

We
entered into an Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement dated
July 1, 2014 with CANX whereby the Joint Venture Agreement dated
November 19, 2013 was modified to provide for (i) up to $12,000,000
in conditional financing subject to review by GrowLife and approval
by OGI for business growth development opportunities in the legal
cannabis industry for up to six months, subject to extension; (ii)
up to $10,000,000 in working capital loans, with each loaning
requiring approval in advance by CANX; (iii) confirmed that the
five year warrants, subject to extension, at $0.033 per share for
the purchase of 140,000,000 and 100,000,000 were fully earned and
were not considered compensation for tax purposes by the Company;
(iv) granted CANX five year warrants, subject to extension, to
purchase 300,000,000 shares of common stock at the fair market
price of $0.033 per share as determined by an independent
appraisal; (v) warrants as defined in the Agreement related to the
achievement of OGI milestones; (vi) a four year term, subject to
adjustment and (vi) the filing of a registration statement on Form
S-1 within 10 days of the filing of our Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2014. Due to our grey sheet trading status and
other issues, we did not file the registration
statement. 

Secured Convertible Note and Secured Credit Facility 

We
entered into a Secured Convertible Note and Secured Credit Facility
dated September 25, 2014 with Logic Works whereby Logic Works
agreed to provide up to $500,000 in funding. Each funding requires
approval in advance by Logic Works, provides for interest at 6%
with a default interest of 24% per annum and requires repayment by
September 26, 2016. The Note is convertible into our common stock
at the lesser of $0.007 or (B) 20% of the average of the three (3)
lowest daily VWAPs occurring during the 20 consecutive Trading Days
immediately preceding the applicable conversion date on which Logic
Works elects to convert all or part of this 6% Convertible Note,
subject to adjustment as provided in the Note. The 6% Convertible
Note is collateralized by our assets.   We also agreed to file a
registration statement on Form S-1 within 10 days of the filing of
our Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and
have the registration statement declared effective within ninety
days of the filing of our Form 10-Q for the three months ended
September 30, 2014. Due to our grey sheet trading status and other
issues, we did not file the registration statement. 

On July
10, 2014, we closed a Waiver and Modification Agreement, Amended
and Restated Joint Venture Agreement, Secured Credit Facility and
Secured Convertible Note with CANX, and Logic Works LLC, a lender
and shareholder of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, we have
borrowed $350,000 under the Secured Convertible Note and Secured
Credit Facility dated September 25, 2014 with Logic
Works. 

Failure
to operate in accordance with the Agreements with CANX could result
in the cancellation of these agreements, result in foreclosure on
our assets in event of default and would have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations or financial
condition. 

Our proposed business is dependent on laws pertaining to the
marijuana industry. 

Continued
development of the marijuana industry is dependent upon continued
legislative authorization of the use and cultivation of marijuana
at the state level.  Any number of factors could slow or
halt progress in this area.  Further, progress, while
encouraging, is not assured.  While there may be ample
public support for legislative action, numerous factors impact
the legislative process.  Any one of these factors could
slow or halt use of marijuana, which would negatively impact our
proposed business. 

As of
September 30, 2016, 23 states and the District of Columbia allow
its citizens to use medical marijuana.  Additionally, 4
states have legalized cannabis for adult use.  The state
laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act,
which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national
level. The Obama administration has effectively stated that it is
not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law
enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by
state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical
marijuana.   However, there is no guarantee that the
administration will not change its stated policy regarding the
low-priority enforcement of federal laws.  Additionally,
any new administration that follows could change this policy and
decide to enforce the federal laws strongly.  Any such
change in the federal government s enforcement of current
federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and its
shareholders. 

Further,
while we do not harvest, distribute or sell marijuana, by supplying
products to growers of marijuana, we could be deemed to be
participating in marijuana cultivation, which remains illegal under
federal law, and exposes us to potential criminal liability, with
the additional risk that our business could be subject to civil
forfeiture proceedings. 

The marijuana industry faces strong opposition.  

It is
believed by many that large, well-funded businesses may have a
strong economic opposition to the marijuana industry.  We
believe that the pharmaceutical industry clearly does not want to
cede control of any product that could generate significant
revenue.  For example, medical marijuana will likely
adversely impact the existing market for the current
 marijuana pill  sold by mainstream pharmaceutical
companies.  Further, the medical marijuana industry could
face a material threat from the pharmaceutical industry, should
marijuana displace other drugs or encroach upon the pharmaceutical
industry s products.  The pharmaceutical industry
is well funded with a strong and experienced lobby that eclipses
the funding of the medical marijuana movement.  Any
inroads the pharmaceutical industry could make in halting or
impeding the marijuana industry harm our business, prospects,
results of operation and financial condition. 

44 

Marijuana remains illegal under Federal
law.   

Marijuana
is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal
law.  Even in those states in which the use of marijuana
has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal
law.  Since federal law criminalizing the use of
marijuana preempts state laws that legalize its use, strict
enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would harm our
business, prospects, results of operation and financial
condition. 

Raising additional capital to implement our business plan and pay
our debts will cause dilution to our existing stockholders, require
us to restructure our operations, and divest all or a portion of
our business. 

We need
additional financing to implement our business plan and to service
our ongoing operations and pay our current debts. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to secure any needed funding, or
that if such funding is available, the terms or conditions would be
acceptable to us. 

If we
raise additional capital through borrowing or other debt financing,
we may incur substantial interest expense. Sales of additional
equity securities will dilute on a pro rata basis the percentage
ownership of all holders of common stock. When we raise more equity
capital in the future, it will result in substantial dilution to
our current stockholders. 

If we
are unable to obtain additional financing when it is needed, we
will need to restructure our operations, and divest all or a
portion of our business. 

Potential Convertible Note Defaults 

Several of the Company s convertible promissory notes remain
outstanding beyond their respective maturity dates. This may
trigger an event of default under the respective agreements. The
Company is working with these noteholders to convert their notes
into common stock and intends to resolve these outstanding issues
as soon as practicable.  Any default could have a significant
adverse effect on our cash flows and should we be unsuccessful in
negotiating an extension or other modification, we may have to
restructure our operations, divest all or a portion of its
business, or file for bankruptcy. 

Closing of bank accounts could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and/or results of
operations. 

As a
result of the regulatory environment, we have experienced the
closing of several of our bank accounts since March 2014. We have
been able to open other bank accounts. However, we may have other
banking accounts closed. These factors impact management and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and/or results of operations. 

Federal regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the
implementation of medical marijuana laws and regulations may
negatively impact our revenues and profits.  

Currently,
there are twenty three states plus the District of Columbia that
have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another
legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis
in connection with medical treatment. Many other states are
considering legislation to similar effect. As of the date of this
writing, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and
its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of
activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal
use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be
permitted on the basis of state law. Active enforcement of the
current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or
national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of
customers of GrowLife to invest in or buy products from GrowLife
that may be used in connection with cannabis. Active enforcement of
the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus
indirectly and adversely affect revenues and profits of the
GrowLife companies. 

Our history of net losses has raised substantial doubt regarding
our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not continue
as a going concern, investors could lose their entire
investment. 

Our
history of net losses has raised substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern, and as a result, our
independent registered public accounting firm included an
explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 with
respect to this uncertainty. Accordingly, our ability to continue
as a going concern will require us to seek alternative financing to
fund our operations. This going concern opinion could materially
limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of
new debt or equity securities or otherwise. Future reports on our
financial statements may include an explanatory paragraph with
respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

We have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance
that we can again achieve or maintain profitability. 

We have
experienced net losses since inception. As of September 30, 2016,
we had an accumulated deficit of $ 118.5  million. There can be no assurance
that we will achieve or maintain profitability. 

45 

We are subject to corporate governance and internal control
reporting requirements, and our costs related to compliance with,
or our failure to comply with existing and future requirements,
could adversely affect our business. 

We must
comply with corporate governance requirements under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as additional
rules and regulations currently in place and that may be
subsequently adopted by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. These laws, rules, and regulations continue to
evolve and may become increasingly stringent in the future. We are
required to include management s report on internal controls
as part of our annual report pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We strive to continuously evaluate and improve
our control structure to help ensure that we comply with Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The financial cost of compliance
with these laws, rules, and regulations is expected to remain
substantial. 

We
cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with these
laws, rules, and regulations that address corporate governance,
internal control reporting, and similar matters. Failure to comply
with these laws, rules and regulations could materially adversely
affect our reputation, financial condition, and the value of our
securities. 

Our management has concluded that we have material weaknesses in
our internal controls over financial reporting and that our
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting that is less severe than a
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those
responsible for oversight of the company's financial reporting.
During the review of our financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015, our management identified material weaknesses in
our internal control over financial reporting. If these weaknesses
continue, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and
completeness of our financial reports and other
disclosures. 

Our inability to effectively manage our growth could harm our
business and materially and adversely affect our operating results
and financial condition. 

Our
strategy envisions growing our business. We plan to expand our
product, sales, administrative and marketing organizations. Any
growth in or expansion of our business is likely to continue to
place a strain on our management and administrative resources,
infrastructure and systems. As with other growing businesses, we
expect that we will need to further refine and expand our business
development capabilities, our systems and processes and our access
to financing sources. We also will need to hire, train, supervise
and manage new and retain contributing employees. These processes
are time consuming and expensive, will increase management
responsibilities and will divert management attention. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to: 

expand
our products effectively or efficiently or in a timely
manner; 

allocate our human
resources optimally; 

meet
our capital needs; 

identify and hire
qualified employees or retain valued employees; or 

incorporate
effectively the components of any business or product line that we
may acquire in our effort to achieve growth. 

Our inability or failure to manage our growth and expansion
effectively could harm our business and materially and adversely
affect our operating results and financial condition. 

Our
operating results may fluctuate significantly based on customer
acceptance of our products. As a result, period-to-period
comparisons of our results of operations are unlikely to provide a
good indication of our future performance. Management expects that
we will experience substantial variations in our net sales and
operating results from quarter to quarter due to customer
acceptance of our products. If customers don t accept our
products, our sales and revenues will decline, resulting in a
reduction in our operating income. 

Customer
interest for our products could also be impacted by the timing of
our introduction of new products. If our competitors introduce new
products around the same time that we issue new products, and if
such competing products are superior to our own, customers 
desire for our products could decrease, resulting in a decrease in
our sales and revenues. To the extent that we introduce new
products and customers decide not to migrate to our new products
from our older products, our revenues could be negatively impacted
due to the loss of revenue from those customers. In the event that
our newer products do not sell as well as our older products, we
could also experience a reduction in our revenues and operating
income. 

46 

As a
result of fluctuations in our revenue and operating expenses that
may occur, management believes that period-to-period comparisons of
our results of operations are unlikely to provide a good indication
of our future performance.  

If we do not successfully generate additional products and
services, or if such products and services are developed but not
successfully commercialized, we could lose revenue
opportunities. 

Our
future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our
product and service offerings. To that end we have engaged in the
process of identifying new product opportunities to provide
additional products and related services to our customers. The
process of identifying and commercializing new products is complex
and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict
customers  changing needs and emerging technological trends
our business could be harmed. We may have to commit significant
resources to commercializing new products before knowing whether
our investments will result in products the market will accept.
Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on commercializing
those products because of errors in product planning or timing,
technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or
a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors
providing those solutions before we do and a reduction in net sales
and earnings. 

The
success of new products depends on several factors, including
proper new product definition, timely completion and introduction
of these products, differentiation of new products from those of
our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. There can
be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product
opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely
manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products or that
products and technologies developed by others will not render our
products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 

Our future success depends on our ability to grow and expand our
customer base.  Our failure to achieve such growth or
expansion could materially harm our business. 

To
date, our revenue growth has been derived primarily from the sale
of our products and through the purchase of existing businesses.
Our success and the planned growth and expansion of our business
depend on us achieving greater and broader acceptance of our
products and expanding our customer base. There can be no assurance
that customers will purchase our products or that we will continue
to expand our customer base. If we are unable to effectively market
or expand our product offerings, we will be unable to grow and
expand our business or implement our business strategy. This could
materially impair our ability to increase sales and revenue and
materially and adversely affect our margins, which could harm our
business and cause our stock price to decline. 

If we
incur substantial liability from litigation, complaints, or
enforcement actions resulting from misconduct by our distributors,
our financial condition could suffer. We will require that our
distributors comply with applicable law and with our policies and
procedures. Although we will use various means to address
misconduct by our distributors, including maintaining these
policies and procedures to govern the conduct of our distributors
and conducting training seminars, it will still be difficult to
detect and correct all instances of misconduct. Violations of
applicable law or our policies and procedures by our distributors
could lead to litigation, formal or informal complaints,
enforcement actions, and inquiries by various federal, state, or
foreign regulatory authorities against us and/or our distributors.
Litigation, complaints, and enforcement actions involving us and
our distributors could consume considerable amounts of financial
and other corporate resources, which could have a negative impact
on our sales, revenue, profitability and growth prospects. As we
are currently in the process of implementing our direct sales
distributor program, we have not been, and are not currently,
subject to any material litigation, complaint or enforcement action
regarding distributor misconduct by any federal, state or foreign
regulatory authority. 

Our
future manufacturers could fail to fulfill our orders for products,
which would disrupt our business, increase our costs, harm our
reputation and potentially cause us to lose our
market. 

We may
depend on contract manufacturers in the future to produce our
products. These manufacturers could fail to produce products to our
specifications or in a workmanlike manner and may not deliver the
units on a timely basis. Our manufacturers may also have to obtain
inventories of the necessary parts and tools for production. Any
change in manufacturers to resolve production issues could disrupt
our ability to fulfill orders. Any change in manufacturers to
resolve production issues could also disrupt our business due to
delays in finding new manufacturers, providing specifications and
testing initial production. Such disruptions in our business and/or
delays in fulfilling orders would harm our reputation and would
potentially cause us to lose our market.  

Our inability to effectively protect our intellectual property
would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively, our
revenue, our financial condition and our results of
operations. 

We may
be unable to obtain intellectual property rights to effectively
protect our business. Our ability to compete effectively may be
affected by the nature and breadth of our intellectual property
rights. While we intend to defend against any threats to our
intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that any
such actions will adequately protect our interests. If we are
unable to secure intellectual property rights to effectively
protect our technology, our revenue and earnings, financial
condition, and/or results of operations would be adversely
affected. 

47 

We may
also rely on nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to
protect portions of our technology. There can be no assurance that
these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate
remedies for any breach, that third parties will not otherwise gain
access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge, or that third
parties will not independently develop the technology. 

We do
not warrant any opinion as to non-infringement of any patent,
trademark, or copyright by us or any of our affiliates, providers,
or distributors. Nor do we warrant any opinion as to invalidity of
any third-party patent or unpatentability of any third-party
pending patent application.  

Our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and
resources than many of our competitors, which may give them an
advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or
make our products obsolete. 

We are
involved in a highly competitive industry where we may compete with
numerous other companies who offer alternative methods or
approaches, may have far greater resources, more experience, and
personnel perhaps more qualified than we do. Such resources may
give our competitors an advantage in developing and marketing
products similar to ours or products that make our products
obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully compete against these other entities. 

Transfers of our securities may be restricted by virtue of state
securities  blue sky  laws, which prohibit trading
absent compliance with individual state laws. These restrictions
may make it difficult or impossible to sell shares in those
states. 

Transfers
of our common stock may be restricted under the securities or
securities regulations laws promulgated by various states and
foreign jurisdictions, commonly referred to as "blue sky" laws.
Absent compliance with such individual state laws, our common stock
may not be traded in such jurisdictions. Because the securities
held by many of our stockholders have not been registered for
resale under the blue sky laws of any state, the holders of such
shares and persons who desire to purchase them should be aware that
there may be significant state blue sky law restrictions upon the
ability of investors to sell the securities and of purchasers to
purchase the securities. These restrictions may prohibit the
secondary trading of our common stock. Investors should consider
the secondary market for our securities to be a limited
one. 

We are dependent on key personnel and we are default under
Employment and Consulting Agreements 

Our
success depends to a significant degree upon the continued
contributions of key management and other personnel, some of whom
could be difficult to replace. We do not maintain key man life
insurance covering our officers. Our success will depend on the
performance of our officers and key management and other personnel,
our ability to retain and motivate our officers, our ability to
integrate new officers and key management and other personnel into
our operations, and the ability of all personnel to work together
effectively as a team. Our failure to retain and recruit
officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. 

We have limited insurance. 

We have
no directors  and officers  liability insurance and
limited commercial liability insurance policies. Any significant
claims would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of
operations.   

Risks Related to our Common Stock 

CANX and Logic Works and TCA could have significant influence over
matters submitted to stockholders for approval. 

CANX and Logic Works 

As of
September 30, 2016, CANX and Logic Works in the aggregate hold
shares representing approximately 39.8% of our common stock on a
fully-converted basis and could be considered a control group for
purposes of SEC rules. However, their agreements limit their
ownership to 4.99% individually and each of the parties disclaims
its status as a control group or a beneficial owner due to the fact
that their beneficial ownership is limited to 4.99% per their
agreements. Beneficial ownership includes shares over which an
individual or entity has investment or voting power and includes
shares that could be issued upon the exercise of options and
warrants within 60 days after the date of
determination. 

48 

TCA 

As a
result of funding from TCA as previously detailed, they exercise
significant control over us. 

If
these persons were to choose to act together, they would be able to
significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders
for approval, as well as our officers, directors, management and
affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act
together, could significantly influence the election of directors
and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power
could delay or prevent an acquisition of us on terms that other
stockholders may desire. 

Trading in our stock is limited by the lack of market makers and
the SEC s penny stock regulations. 

On
April 10, 2014, as a result of the SEC suspension in the trading of
our securities, we lost all market makers and traded on the grey
market of OTCBB. Until we complied with FINRA Rule 15c2-11, we
traded on the grey market, which has limited quotations and
marketability of securities. Holders of our common stock found it
more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as
to the market value of, our common stock, and the market value of
our common stock declined. 

On
February 18, 2016, our common stock resumed unsolicited quotation
on the OTC Bulletin Board after receiving clearance from the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) on
our Form 15c2-11. We are currently taking the appropriate steps to
uplist to the OTCQB Exchange and resume priced quotations with
market makers as soon as it is able. 

Our
stock is categorized as a penny stock The SEC has adopted Rule
15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity
security that has a market price (as defined) less than US$ 5.00
per share or an exercise price of less than US$ 5.00 per share,
subject to certain exclusions (e.g., net tangible assets in excess
of $2,000,000 or average revenue of at least $6,000,000 for the
last three years). The penny stock rules impose additional sales
practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other
than established customers and accredited investors. The penny
stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a
penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a
standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the
SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature
and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer
also must provide the customer with current bid and offer
quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the
broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly
account statements showing the market value of each penny stock
held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and
the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be
given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the
transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or
with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock
rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not
otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a
special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable
investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written
agreement to the transaction. Finally, broker-dealers may not
handle penny stocks under $0.10 per share. 

These
disclosure requirements reduce the level of trading activity in the
secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock
rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules would affect the
ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities if we become
subject to them in the future. The penny stock rules also could
discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our
common stock to future investors, resulting in limited ability for
investors to sell their shares. 

FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a
shareholder s ability to buy and sell our stock. 

In
addition to the  penny stock  rules described above,
FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an
investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable
grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that
customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities
to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make
reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other
information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes
that there is a high probability that speculative low priced
securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The
FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to
recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may
limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse
effect on the market for our shares. 

The market price of our common stock may be volatile. 

The
market price of our common stock has been and is likely in the
future to be volatile. Our common stock price may fluctuate in
response to factors such as:  

Halting of trading by the SEC or
FINRA. 

Announcements by
us regarding liquidity, legal proceedings, significant
acquisitions, equity investments and divestitures, strategic
relationships, addition or loss of significant customers and
contracts, capital expenditure commitments, loan, note payable and
agreement defaults, loss of our subsidiaries and impairment of
assets, 

Issuance of
convertible or equity securities for general or merger and
acquisition purposes, 

Issuance or
repayment of debt, accounts payable or convertible debt for general
or merger and acquisition purposes, 

Sale
of a significant number of shares of our common stock by
shareholders, 

General market and
economic conditions, 

49 

Quarterly
variations in our operating results, 

Investor relation
activities, 

Announcements of
technological innovations, 

New
product introductions by us or our competitors, 

Competitive
activities, and 

Additions or
departures of key personnel. 

These
broad market and industry factors may have a material adverse
effect on the market price of our common stock, regardless of our
actual operating performance. These factors could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results
of operations. 

The sale of a significant number of our shares of common stock
could depress the price of our common stock. 

Sales
or issuances of a large number of shares of common stock in the
public market or the perception that sales may occur could cause
the market price of our common stock to decline. As of September
30, 2016, there were approximately  1.312  billion shares of our common stock
issued and outstanding.  In addition, as of September 30,
2016, there are also (i) stock option grants outstanding for the
purchase of  24  million common
shares at a $0.023 average strike price; (ii) warrants for the
purchase of  565  million common
shares at a $0.032 average exercise price; and (iii)  267.6  million  shares related to convertible debt that can be
converted at 0.0036 per share. In addition, we have an unknown
number of common shares to be issued under the TCA and Chicago
Venture financing agreements because the number of shares
ultimately issued to TCA depends on the price at which TCA converts
its debt to shares. The lower the conversion price, the more shares
that will be issued to TCA or Chicago Venture upon the conversion
of debt to shares. We won t know the exact number of shares
of stock issued to TCA or Chicago Venture until the debt is
actually converted to equity.  If all stock option grant,
warrant and contingent shares are issued, approximately 2.168
billion of our currently authorized 3 billion shares of common
stock will be issued and outstanding.    For purposes of estimating the number
of shares issuable upon the exercise/conversion of all stock
options, warrants and contingent shares, we assumed the number of
shares and average share prices detailed above. 

These
stock option grant, warrant and contingent shares could result in
further dilution to common stock holders and may affect the market
price of the common stock. 

Significant
shares of common stock are held by our principal shareholders,
other Company insiders and other large shareholders. As affiliates
as defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act or Rule 144 of the
Company, our principal shareholders, other Company insiders and
other large shareholders may only sell their shares of common stock
in the public market pursuant to an effective registration
statement or in compliance with Rule 144. 

Some of
the present shareholders have acquired shares at prices as low
as $0.007 per share, whereas other shareholders have
purchased their shares at prices ranging from $0.0036 to $0.78
per share. 

These
stock option grant, warrant and contingent shares could result in
further dilution to common stock holders and may affect the market
price of the common stock. 

Some of our convertible debentures may require adjustment in the
conversion price. 

Our 7%
Convertible Notes Payable and our 6% Convertible Secured
Convertible Note and Secured Credit Facility dated September 25,
2014 with Logic Works may require an adjustment in the current
conversion price of $0.0036 per share if we issue common stock,
warrants or equity below the price that is reflected in the
convertible notes payable. The conversion price of the convertible
notes will have an impact on the market price of our common stock.
Specifically, if under the terms of the convertible notes the
conversion price goes down, then the market price, and ultimately
the trading price, of our common stock will go down. If under the
terms of the convertible notes the conversion price goes up, then
the market price, and ultimately the trading price, of our common
stock will likely go up. In other words, as the conversion price
goes down, so does the market price of our stock. As the conversion
price goes up, so presumably does the market price of our stock.
The more the conversion price goes down, the more shares are issued
upon conversion of the debt which ultimately means the more stock
that might flood into the market, potentially causing a further
depression of our stock. 

50 

We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock
in the foreseeable future. 

We have
never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We
currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to
finance the growth and development of our business, and we do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the
foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt
agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result,
capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole
source of gain for the foreseeable future. 

Anti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to
acquire our company, which could cause our stock price to
decline. 

Our
certificate of incorporation, as amended, our bylaws and Delaware
law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a
third party from acquiring our company, even if doing so may be
beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, these provisions could
limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for
shares of our common stock. 

We may issue preferred stock that could have rights that are
preferential to the rights of common stock that could discourage
potentially beneficially transactions to our common
shareholders. 

An
issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could result in a
class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with
respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over our
common stock and could, upon conversion or otherwise, have all of
the rights of our common stock.  Our Board of Directors'
authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential
takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control
through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making
these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve.  The
issuance of preferred stock could impair the voting, dividend and
liquidation rights of common stockholders without their
approval. 

If the company were to dissolve or wind-up, holders of our common
stock may not receive a liquidation preference. 

If we
were too wind-up or dissolve the Company and liquidate and
distribute our assets, our shareholders would share ratably in our
assets only after we satisfy any amounts we owe to our
creditors.  If our liquidation or dissolution were
attributable to our inability to profitably operate our business,
then it is likely that we would have material liabilities at the
time of liquidation or dissolution.  Accordingly, we
cannot give you any assurance that sufficient assets will remain
available after the payment of our creditors to enable you to
receive any liquidation distribution with respect to any shares you
may hold. 

Risks Associated with Securities Purchase Agreement with Chicago
Venture 

The
Securities Purchase Agreement with Chicago Venture will terminate
if we file protection from its creditors, a Registration Statement
on Form S-1 is not effective, and our market capitalization or the
trading volume of our common stock does not reach certain levels.
If terminated, we will be unable to draw down all or substantially
all of our $2,500,000 Chicago Venture Note. 

Our
ability to require Chicago Venture to fund the Chicago Venture Note
is at our discretion, subject to certain limitations. Chicago
Venture is obligated to fund if each of the following conditions
are met; (i) the average and median daily dollar volumes of our
common stock for the twenty (20) and sixty (60) trading days
immediately preceding the funding date are greater than $100,000;
(ii) our market capitalization on the funding date is greater than
$17,000,000; (iii) we are not in default with respect to share
delivery obligations under the note as of the funding date; and
(iv) we are current in its reporting obligations. 

There
is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the foregoing
conditions or any other conditions under the Securities Purchase
Agreement and/or Chicago Venture Note or that we will be able to
draw down any portion of the amounts available under the Securities
Purchase Agreement and/or Chicago Venture Note. 

If we
not able to draw down all $2,500,000 available under the Securities
Purchase Agreement or if the Securities Purchase Agreement is
terminated, we may be forced to curtail the scope of our operations
or alter our business plan if other financing is not available to
us. 

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

Unless otherwise indicated, all of the following sales or issuances
of Company securities were conducted under the exemption from
registration as provided under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933 (and also qualified for exemption under 4(5), formerly 4(6)
of the Securities Act of 1933, except as noted below). All of the
shares issued were issued in transactions not involving a public
offering, are considered to be restricted stock as defined in Rule
144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 and stock
certificates issued with respect thereto bear legends to that
effect.  

51 

We have compensated consultants and service providers with
restricted common stock during the development of our business and
when our capital resources were not adequate to provide payment in
cash. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had the
following sales of unregistered of equity securities to accredited
investors unless otherwise indicated: 

On July
13, 2016, we issued 6,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to
 Settlement Agreement and
Release  with Mr. Robert Hunt, a former executive While the
conditions had not been met, we issued 6,000,000 shares of common
stock on July 13, 2016 which were valued at $0.010 per
share. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, a Holder of the
Company s Convertible Notes Payables, converted principal and
accrued interest of $235,660 into 33,665,701 shares of the
Company s common stock at a per share conversion price of
$0.007. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, Old Main converted
principal and accrued interest of $638,000 into 120,746,617 shares
of our common stock at a per share conversion price of
$0.0053. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, Chicago Venture
converted principal and accrued interest of $128,000 into
22,371,716 shares of our common stock at a per share conversion
price of $0.0057.

EXHIBIT
31.1 

SECTION 302 CERTIFICATIONS 

I,
Marco Hegyi, certify that: 

1.
  I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of
GrowLife, Inc.; 

2.
  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
with respect to the period covered by this report; 

3.
  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and
other financial information included in this report, fairly present
in all material respects the financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the
periods presented in this report; 

4.
  The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and
I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
registrant and have: 

a)
  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or
caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to
the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
known to us by others within those entities, particularly during
the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b)
