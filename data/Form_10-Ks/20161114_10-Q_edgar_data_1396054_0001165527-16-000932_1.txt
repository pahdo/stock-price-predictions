1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS

U.S.  Lithium,  Corp.  (formerly  Rostock  Ventures  Corp.) (the  "Company") was
incorporated  in the  State of  Nevada  on  November  2,  2006 and is a  natural
resource   exploration  and  production  company  engaged  in  the  exploration,
acquisition,  and  development of mineral  properties in the United  States.  On
April 27,  2016,  the  Company  incorporated  and merged  with its  wholly-owned
subsidiary,  U.S.  Lithium Corp.  for the sole purpose of enacting a name change
and acquired 100% of the titles,  interest, and rights to four mineral claims in
Esmeralda County, Nevada.

GOING CONCERN

These financial  statements  have been prepared on a going concern basis,  which
implies that the Company will  continue to realize its assets and  discharge its
liabilities  in the normal  course of business.  As at September  30, 2016,  the
Company has not earned revenue,  has a working capital deficit of $261,062,  and
an accumulated deficit of $1,194,810. The continuation of the Company as a going
concern is dependent upon the continued  financial  support from its management,
and its  ability to  identify  future  investment  opportunities  and obtain the
necessary debt or equity financing,  and generating  profitable  operations from
the Company's future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements
do not include any  adjustments  to the  recoverability  and  classification  of
recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Basis of Presentation

The financial  statements  of the Company have been prepared in accordance  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States ("US GAAP") and
are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company's fiscal year end is December 31.

(b) Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of financial  statements in  conformity  with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly  evaluates estimates
and assumptions related to the recoverability of mineral properties, share based
compensation,  and deferred income tax asset valuation  allowances.  The Company
bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts,  historical experience and
various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the  results  of which form the basis for making  judgments  about the  carrying
values of assets and  liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are
not readily apparent from other sources.  The actual results  experienced by the
Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the
extent  there are  material  differences  between the  estimates  and the actual
results, future results of operations will be affected.

(c) Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company  considers  all highly liquid  instruments  with a maturity of three
months or less at the time of issuance to be cash  equivalents.  As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no cash equivalents.

(d) Mineral Property Costs

The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation on November 2,
2006 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations.  Mineral
property acquisition and exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has

                                       7

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

been  determined  that a mineral  property  can be  economically  developed as a
result of  establishing  proven and  probable  reserves,  the costs  incurred to
develop such property are  capitalized.  Such costs will be amortized  using the
units-of-production  method over the estimated life of the probable reserve.  If
mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs
will be charged to operations.

(e) Asset Retirement Obligations

The  Company   follows  the  provisions  of  ASC  410,   ASSET   RETIREMENT  AND
ENVIRONMENTAL   OBLIGATIONS,   which  establishes   standards  for  the  initial
measurement and subsequent accounting for obligations  associated with the sale,
abandonment  or other  disposal of long-lived  tangible  assets arising from the
acquisition,  construction  or  development  and for normal  operations  of such
assets.

(f) Loss per Share

The Company  computes net income  (loss) per share in  accordance  with ASC 260,
EARNINGS  PER SHARE.  ASC 260  requires  presentation  of both basic and diluted
earnings  per share  ("EPS") on the face of the income  statement.  Basic EPS is
computed  by  dividing  net  income  (loss)  available  to  common  shareholders
(numerator) by the weighted average number of shares  outstanding  (denominator)
during the period.  Diluted EPS gives  effect to all dilutive  potential  common
shares  outstanding  during  the  period  using the  treasury  stock  method and
convertible  preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted
EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of
shares  assumed to be purchased  from the exercise of stock options or warrants.
Diluted  EPS  excludes  all  dilutive   potential  shares  if  their  effect  is
anti-dilutive.

(g) Foreign Currency Translation

The Company's  functional  and reporting  currency is the United States  dollar.
Foreign  currency  transactions  are primarily  undertaken in Canadian  dollars.
Foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  to United  States  dollars  in
accordance  with  ASC 830,  FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION  MATTERS,  using  the
exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.  Gains and losses arising on
translation  or  settlement  of foreign  currency  denominated  transactions  or
balances are included in the determination of income.

(h) Financial Instruments

Pursuant  to ASC 820,  FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENTS  AND  DISCLOSURES,  an entity is
required  to  maximize  the use of  observable  inputs and  minimize  the use of
unobservable  inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value
hierarchy based on the level of independent,  objective evidence surrounding the
inputs used to measure  fair  value.  A  financial  instrument's  categorization
within the fair value  hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value  measurement.  ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into
three levels that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1

Level 1 applies to assets or  liabilities  for which there are quoted  prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2

Level 2 applies to assets or  liabilities  for which there are inputs other than
quoted  prices that are  observable  for the asset or  liability  such as quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities  in active  markets;  quoted prices for

                                       8

(unaudited)

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

(h) Financial Instruments (continued)

identical  assets  or  liabilities  in  markets  with  insufficient   volume  or
infrequent  transactions (less active markets);  or model-derived  valuations in
which significant  inputs are observable or can be derived  principally from, or
corroborated by, observable market data.

Level 3

Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs
to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair
value of the assets or liabilities.

The  Company's  financial  instruments  consist  principally  of cash,  accounts
payable  and  accrued  liabilities,  note  payables,  and amounts due to related
parties.  Pursuant  to ASC 820,  the fair value of cash is  determined  based on
"Level 1" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their
current fair values  because of their nature and  respective  maturity  dates or
durations.

(i) Income Taxes

The Company  accounts for income taxes using the asset and  liability  method in
accordance  with ASC 740,  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.  The asset and liability
method  provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary  differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and  liabilities,  and for operating  loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
the  currently  enacted  tax rates  and laws  that  will be in  effect  when the
differences are expected to reverse.  The Company records a valuation  allowance
to reduce  deferred  tax assets to the amount that is believed  more likely than
not to be realized.

(j) Comprehensive Loss

ASC 220,  COMPREHENSIVE  INCOME,  establishes  standards  for the  reporting and
display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As
at  September  30,  2016  and  December  31,  2015,  the  Company  has no  items
representing comprehensive income or loss.

(k) Stock-based Compensation

The  Company  records  stock-based  compensation  in  accordance  with  ASC 718,
COMPENSATION - STOCK  COMPENSATION using the fair value method. All transactions
in which goods or services  are the  consideration  received for the issuance of
equity   instruments   are  accounted  for  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the
consideration  received  or the fair  value  of the  equity  instrument  issued,
whichever is more reliably  measurable.  Equity  instruments issued to employees
and the  cost  of the  services  received  as  consideration  are  measured  and
recognized  based on the fair  value of the  equity  instruments  issued.  As at
September  30, 2016 and December  31, 2015,  the Company did not grant any stock
options.

(l) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The  Company  has  implemented  all new  accounting  pronouncements  that are in
effect.  These  pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial
statements  unless  otherwise  disclosed,  and the Company does not believe that
there are any other new  accounting  pronouncements  that have been  issued that
might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

CORPORATE HISTORY

We were incorporated on November 2, 2006, under the laws of the State of Nevada.
The original  business plan of our company was to engage in the  acquisition and
exploration  of  mineral  properties.  We are  currently  an  exploration  stage
company.

On September 30, 2015, our board of directors and a majority of our stockholders
approved an increase of our authorized capital from 100,000,000 shares of common
stock,  par value  $0.0001  to  500,000,000  shares of common  stock,  par value
$0.0001.

A Certificate of Amendment to effect the increase to our authorized  capital was
filed with the Nevada  Secretary of State on October 20, 2015, with an effective
date of October 20, 2015.

On April 25,  2016,  our board of  directors  approved the change of our name to
"U.S.  Lithium  Corp.".  The  change of name  became  effective  with the Nevada
Secretary  of State on May 10,  2016 by way of a  merger  with our  wholly-owned
subsidiary,  U.S. Lithium Corp.,  which was formed solely for the purpose of the
change of name.  The change of name became  effective  with  Financial  Industry
Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"),  on June 13, 2016. In connection with our change
of name,  our trading  symbol was changed to "LITH".  Our CUSIP number is 90351E
105.

CURRENT BUSINESS

Effective  March 12, 2014, we entered into a patent,  technical  information and
trade mark license  agreement with Windward  International LLC pursuant to which
our company  acquired an  exclusive  license to use certain  patents,  technical

                                       12
 
information  and trademarks  for a term of 500 years,  in exchange for 4,000,000
shares of our  company's  common stock and a 2% royalty on all net sales derived
from the use of the patents,  technical information and trademark.  The business
focus was the operation of a technology  platform  designed to connect consumers
with cannabis vendors.

Under the license agreement,  our company acquired an exclusive license to make,
use, sell and offer for sale  licensed  products  during the term.  The licensed
products  include  the domain  names  www.iWeeds.com,  and  www.iWeedz.com,  the
platform  that  powers  iWeedz.com,  the Apple  Developer  license,  Google Play
license,  iWeedz  trademark,   self-serve  ad  platform  and  augmented  reality
platform.  Further,  our  company  acquired  an  exclusive  license  to use  the
technical  information during the term to make licensed products.  The technical
information   includes  any  and  all   unpublished   research  and  development
information,   the  formulation  of  proprietary  products,  method,  unpatented
inventions,  know-how,  trade  secrets,  and technical data in the possession of
Windward  at the  effective  date of the  license  agreement,  or  generated  or
developed  at any time prior to the  termination  or  expiration  of the license
agreement.

We operate  iWeedz.com,  a technology  platform  that we acquired  from Windward
pursuant to the license agreement to connect consumers with cannabis vendors and
promote  local  marijuana  commerce.  We will  operate our  technology  platform
through our website located at www.iWeedz.com and through our mobile application
for Apple iOS and Android operating  systems.  We will strive for simplicity and
ease of use in our iWeedz website and mobile application,  which we believe will
set us apart from our competition. As of the date of this report, our website is
not fully  functional and our  application  for Apple iOS and Android  operating
systems has not been released.

Our company has moved away from the technology sector and is actively  searching
for additional  projects  particularly in the exploration of mineral properties.
These new areas have been  narrowed  down to graphite and lithium.  With this in
mind, on February 10, 2016,  our company  appointed  Eric Allison as a member of
our board of  directors.  Mr.  Allison  has over 35 years of  experience  in the
natural resource industry working in various technical, business development and
management  roles.  He currently  provides  consulting  services to a variety of
companies,  funds,  project  developers and  individuals  on a global basis.  He
formerly served, from 2012-2015, as CEO and COO of Brazahav Resources, a private
entity developing a brownfield gold mine project in Mato Grosso,  Brazil.  Prior
to this, he was the Director of Research and Chief  Geologist at Casimir Capital
LP specializing  in junior mining  companies.  Previously,  he was a Director at
Sempra Commodities from 1999-2009 where his  responsibilities  included Metals &
Concentrates  and Energy.  Over his career,  he has also served in various roles
for Cyprus Amax Minerals,  Amax Energy,  SPG Exploration and Texaco. Mr. Allison
received a BS in Geology from Brown University (1978) and a MS in Marine Geology
from the University of Georgia (1980).

On April 4, 2016, we entered into a letter of intent with Rangefront  Consulting
LLC.  Pursuant  to the  letter  of  intent,  we are to enter  into a  definitive
agreement with Rangefront whereby Rangefront will grant us the option to acquire
100% of the title,  interest and right in and to four mineral  claims,  the ELON
Claims, in Esmerelda County,  Nevada. In exchange for the grant of the option by
Rangefront, we shall:

     1.   pay $3,500 to Rangefront on signing of a definitive agreement; and

     2.   issue an  aggregate of 200,000  common  shares of our company to Brian
          Goss as the authorized representative of Rangefront.

On April 25, 2016,  we entered into a material  definitive  agreement and issued
200,000  restricted  common  shares as outlined in the letter of intent.  We now
hold a 100% interest in the ELON claims in Clayton Valley, Nevada.

The ELON claim block  consists of four 20-acre  placer  claims and is located in
Esmerelda County,  Nevada,  and is contiguous to claims held by both PURE Energy
and Lithium X in Clayton  Valley.  Clayton Valley is home to Albemarle's  Silver
Peak Lithium Mine, the only mine producing  lithium from brine in North America.
Both PURE Energy and Lithium X are actively  exploring  their  respective  claim

                                       13
 
blocks  in  Clayton  Valley.  The  Clayton  Valley  area has  been the  focus of
significant  levels of exploration and acreage  acquisition in recent months and
is  considered  to be one of the best  places for lithium  exploration  in North
America.

The company  looks to  capitalize  on  opportunities  within the lithium  sector
including  providing  lithium  to the ever  expanding  next  generation  battery
market.  Lithium  demand is projected to triple by the year 2025  according to a
recent  report by Goldman  Sachs and for many  analysts  is  considered  the new
gasoline of the future.  Our current focus is in the Basin and Range province of
Nevada where the only producing lithium brine mine in North America, Albemarle's
Silver Peak Project, is located.  Elon, our first project, is located in Clayton
Valley  and is in close  proximity  to  Silver  Peak and  several  other  active
explorers and developers.

On April 8, 2016, we entered into a securities  purchase  agreement  with Robert
Seeley,  whereupon we agreed to sell to Mr. Seeley,  for an aggregate of $10,000
in cash,  a  convertible  promissory  note for the  aggregate  principal  sum of
$10,000,  which includes  simple interest at a rate of 10% and is convertible in
common  shares of our company for  $0.0125 per share.  This note  matures in one
year from issuance.

Additionally,  we entered into a securities  purchase  agreement dated April 21,
2016  with  Mr.  Seeley,  whereupon  we  agreed  to sell to Mr.  Seeley,  for an
aggregate of $5,000 in cash, a  convertible  promissory  note for the  aggregate
principal sum of $5,000,  which includes simple interest at a rate of 10% and is
convertible  in common  shares of our  company  for $0.015 per share.  This note
matures in one year from issuance.

On May 5, 2016,  we entered into a  securities  purchase  agreement  with Robert
Seeley,  whereupon we agreed to sell to Mr. Seeley,  for an aggregate of $50,000
in cash,  a  convertible  promissory  note for the  aggregate  principal  sum of
$50,000, which includes simple interest at a rate of 10% and is convertible into
common share of our company at $0.0275 per share.  This note matures in one year
from issuance.

On May 11, 2016,  we entered into a securities  purchase  agreement  with Robert
Seeley,  whereupon we agreed to sell to Mr. Seeley,  for an aggregate of $40,000
in cash,  a  convertible  promissory  note for the  aggregate  principal  sum of
$40,000,  which  includes  simple  interest  at a rate of 10% per  annum  and is
convertible  in common  shares of our  company  for $0.035 per share.  This note
matures in one year from issuance.

OPERATING REVENUES

From November 2, 2006 (date of inception) to September 30, 2016, our company did
not record any revenues.

OPERATING EXPENSES AND NET LOSS

Operating  expenses for the three months ended  September  30, 2016 were $19,046
compared  with  $13,315 for the three  months  ended  September  30,  2015.  The
increase in operating expenses were attributed to consulting fees of $5,970 to a
third-party consultant,  and an increase of $1,123 in general and administrative
expense  relating to an increase in  day-to-day  operations  including  transfer
agent and filing fees for issuance of common shares and SEC news releases during
the period  offset by a  decrease  of $1,362 in  professional  fees due to lower
legal fees.

Operating  expenses  for the nine months ended  September  30, 2016 were $72,188
compared with $48,691 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
in operating  expenses  were  attributed  to an increase in  consulting  fees of
$15,137 to a third-party  consultant,  and an increase of $10,853 in general and
administrative  expense  for an  increase in  day-to-day  activities  during the
current  year offset by a decrease of $2,493 in  professional  fees due to lower
legal fees.

Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $143,811 compared with
$61,085 for the nine months ended  September  30, 2015. In addition to operating
expenses,  our company incurred  interest and amortization  accretion of $71,623
(2015 - $30,394)  relating to interest  incurred on the  outstanding  debt,  and
amortization  of the  discount  for the  convertibility  feature of  convertible
debentures. In the prior year, our company also recorded a gain on settlement of
debt of $18,000.

As at  September  30, 2016,  our cash  balance was $4,535  compared to $1,389 at
December  31,  2015 and  total  assets  were  $35,168  compared  to $1,389 as at
December  31,  2015.  The  increase in cash was due to the fact that we received
$105,000 of  financing  during the  current  year for our  operating  activities
whereas  in the  prior  year we only  received  $34,500,  which  resulted  in an
increase in operating  and investing  activities  and an increase in cash during
fiscal  2016.  The  increase in total  assets in addition to cash was due to the
acquisition of mineral properties in the state of Nevada for $14,445 and prepaid
consulting fees of $16,188 during the period ended September 30, 2016.

As at September 30, 2016,  we had total  liabilities  of $281,785  compared with
total  liabilities  of $209,695 as at December 31,  2015.  The increase in total
liabilities  was due to an increase in notes payable of $61,118 for the issuance

                                       15
 
of $105,000 of  non-related  notes  payable,  less discount of $62,150,  and the
accretion of $18,268 of notes payables issued in fiscal 2015.

As at September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $261,062  compared
with a working capital deficit of $208,306 as at December 31, 2015. The increase
in working  capital  deficit is due to the fact that we received  financing  for
notes payable which were used to support our operating expenses.

CASHFLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

During the nine months ended  September  30,  2016,  we used $97,734 of cash for
operating  activities  compared  to the use of  $24,431  of cash  for  operating
activities  during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the
cash used for operating activities was due to the fact that the Company had more
operating  activities  during the  current  period with the  acquisition  of the
mineral  properties  in Nevada and was supported  financially  by an increase in
proceeds  received  from  financing  activities  which helped pay for  operating
activities as they were incurred.

CASHFLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

During the nine months  ended  September  30,  2016,  we used $4,120 of cash for
investing  activities as part of the payment for the  acquisition of the mineral
properties  in Nevada.  During the nine months ended  September 30, 2015, we did
not have any investing activities.

CASHFLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

During the nine  months  ended  September  30,  2016,  we  received  proceeds of
$105,000 from the issuance of notes payables from a non-related  party, which is
unsecured,  bears interest at 10% per annum, and is due within one year from the
issuance of the note.  During the nine  months  ended  September  30,  2015,  we
received  proceeds of $34,500  from the  issuance of a note payable to a related
party, which is unsecured,  bears interest at 10% per annum, and is due on March
4, 2017.

GOING CONCERN

We have not attained  profitable  operations  and are dependent  upon  obtaining
financing  to  pursue  any  extensive  acquisitions  and  activities.  For these
reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements
that they have  substantial  doubt that we will be able to  continue  as a going
concern without further financing.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have no off-balance sheet  arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition,  revenues or  expenses,  results of  operations,  liquidity,  capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

FUTURE FINANCINGS

We will  continue  to rely on  equity  sales of our  common  shares  in order to
continue to fund our business  operations.  Issuances of additional  shares will
result in dilution to existing stockholders.  There is no assurance that we will
achieve any  additional  sales of the equity  securities  or arrange for debt or
other financing to fund our operations and other activities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance
with  United  States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  applied  on a
consistent  basis.  The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with
U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to make

                                       16
 
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting periods.

We regularly  evaluate the  accounting  policies  and  estimates  that we use to
prepare our financial statements.  In general,  management's estimates are based
on historical experience, on information from third party professionals,  and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and
circumstances.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates  made  by
management. Our fiscal year end is December 31.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The  preparation  of financial  statements in  conformity  with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Our company regularly  evaluates estimates
and assumptions related to the recoverability of mineral properties, share based
compensation,  and deferred income tax asset valuation  allowances.  Our company
bases our estimates and assumptions on current facts,  historical experience and
various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the  circumstances,
the  results  of which form the basis for making  judgments  about the  carrying
values of assets and  liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are
not readily apparent from other sources.  The actual results  experienced by our
company may differ materially and adversely from our company's estimates. To the
extent  there are  material  differences  between the  estimates  and the actual
results, future results of operations will be affected.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Our company  considers  all highly liquid  instruments  with a maturity of three
months or less at the time of issuance to be cash  equivalents.  As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no cash equivalents.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Our  company   follows  the  provisions  of  ASC  410,   ASSET   RETIREMENT  AND
ENVIRONMENTAL   OBLIGATIONS,   which  establishes   standards  for  the  initial
measurement and subsequent accounting for obligations  associated with the sale,
abandonment  or other  disposal of long-lived  tangible  assets arising from the
acquisition,  construction  or  development  and for normal  operations  of such
assets.

BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE

Our company  computes net income  (loss) per share in  accordance  with ASC 260,
EARNINGS  PER SHARE.  ASC 260  requires  presentation  of both basic and diluted
earnings  per share  ("EPS") on the face of the income  statement.  Basic EPS is
computed  by  dividing  net  income  (loss)  available  to  common  shareholders
(numerator) by the weighted average number of shares  outstanding  (denominator)
during the period.  Diluted EPS gives  effect to all dilutive  potential  common
shares  outstanding  during  the  period  using the  treasury  stock  method and
convertible  preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted
EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of
shares  assumed to be purchased  from the exercise of stock options or warrants.
Diluted  EPS  excludes  all  dilutive   potential  shares  if  their  effect  is
anti-dilutive.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Our company's  functional  and reporting  currency is the United States  dollar.
Foreign  currency  transactions  are primarily  undertaken in Canadian  dollars.
Foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  to United  States  dollars  in
accordance  with  ASC 830,  FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION  MATTERS,  using  the
exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.  Gains and losses arising on
translation  or  settlement  of foreign  currency  denominated  transactions  or
balances are included in the determination of income.

                                       17
 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Pursuant  to ASC 820,  FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENTS  AND  DISCLOSURES,  an entity is
required  to  maximize  the use of  observable  inputs and  minimize  the use of
unobservable  inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value
hierarchy based on the level of independent,  objective evidence surrounding the
inputs used to measure  fair  value.  A  financial  instrument's  categorization
within the fair value  hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value  measurement.  ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into
three levels that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1: Level 1 applies  to assets or  liabilities  for which  there are quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Level 2 applies  to assets or  liabilities  for which  there are inputs
other than quoted prices that are  observable for the asset or liability such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices
for  identical  assets or  liabilities  in markets with  insufficient  volume or
infrequent  transactions (less active markets);  or model-derived  valuations in
which significant  inputs are observable or can be derived  principally from, or
corroborated by, observable market data.

Level  3:  Level 3  applies  to  assets  or  liabilities  for  which  there  are
unobservable  inputs to the valuation  methodology  that are  significant to the
measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Our  company's  financial  instruments  consist  principally  of cash,  accounts
payable  and  accrued  liabilities,  note  payables,  and amounts due to related
party. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on "Level
1"  inputs,  which  consist of quoted  prices in active  markets  for  identical
assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their
current fair values  because of their nature and  respective  maturity  dates or
durations.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance  indicate
that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of
recoverability  is  based on an  estimate  of  undiscounted  future  cash  flows
resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of
an impairment  loss for long-lived  assets and certain  identifiable  intangible
assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the
asset.  Long-lived  assets  and  certain  identifiable  intangible  assets to be
disposed  of are  reported  at the lower of  carrying  amount or fair value less
costs to sell.

INCOME TAXES

Our company  accounts for income taxes using the asset and  liability  method in
accordance  with ASC 740,  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME Taxes.  The asset and liability
method  provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary  differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and  liabilities,  and for operating  loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
the  currently  enacted  tax rates  and laws  that  will be in  effect  when the
differences are expected to reverse.  Our company records a valuation  allowance
to reduce  deferred  tax assets to the amount that is believed  more likely than
not to be realized.

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

ASC 220,  COMPREHENSIVE  INCOME,  establishes  standards  for the  reporting and
display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As
at  September  30,  2016  and  December  31,  2015,  our  company  has no  items
representing comprehensive income or loss.

                                       18
 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Our  company  records  stock-based  compensation  in  accordance  with  ASC 718,
COMPENSATION - STOCK  COMPENSATION using the fair value method. All transactions
in which goods or services  are the  consideration  received for the issuance of
equity   instruments   are  accounted  for  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the
consideration  received  or the fair  value  of the  equity  instrument  issued,
whichever is more reliably  measurable.  Equity  instruments issued to employees
and the  cost  of the  services  received  as  consideration  are  measured  and
recognized  based on the fair  value of the  equity  instruments  issued.  As at
September  30, 2016 and December  31, 2015,  our company did not grant any stock
options.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Our  company  has  implemented  all new  accounting  pronouncements  that are in
effect.  These  pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial
statements  unless  otherwise  disclosed,  and our company does not believe that
there are any other new  accounting  pronouncements  that have been  issued that
might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information  required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the  Securities
Exchange  Act of 1934,  as  amended,  is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and
reported  within the time  periods  specified  in the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission's  rules and forms,  and that such  information  is  accumulated  and
communicated to our management, including our president (our principal executive
officer,  principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow
for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

As of the  end of  our  quarter  covered  by  this  report,  we  carried  out an
evaluation,  under the supervision and with the  participation  of our president
(our principal  executive  officer,  principal  financial  officer and principal
accounting  officer),  of the  effectiveness  of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on the foregoing,  our president (our
principal   executive  officer,   principal   financial  officer  and  principal
accounting  officer) concluded that our disclosure  controls and procedures were
not  effective  in providing  reasonable  assurance  in the  reliability  of our
reports as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.

I, Gregory Rotelli, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of U.S. Lithium Corp.;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which such statements
     were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the  period  covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))  and internal  control over
     financial  reporting  (as  defined  in  Exchange  Act Rules  13a-15(f)  and
     15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

     (a)  Designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or caused such
          disclosure   controls  and   procedures  to  be  designed   under  our
          supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the
          registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities,  particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;
     (b)  Designed such internal  control over  financial  reporting,  or caused
          such internal  control over  financial  reporting to be designed under
          our  supervision,   to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the
          reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;
     (c)  Evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions  about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
          of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
     (d)  Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's  fourth fiscal quarter in
          the case of an annual  report)  that has  materially  affected,  or is
          reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
     of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting.
