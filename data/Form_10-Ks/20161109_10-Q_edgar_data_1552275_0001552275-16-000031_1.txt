           1. 
    Organization and Principles of Consolidation 
     The Partnership was formed in June 2012 by Susser Holdings Corporation ( Susser ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sunoco GP LLC (formerly known as Susser Petroleum Partners GP LLC), our general partner ( General Partner ). On September 25, 2012, we completed our initial public offering ( IPO ) of   10,925,000   common units representing limited partner interests. 
  On April 27, 2014, Susser entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. ( ETP ) and certain other related entities, under which ETP acquired the outstanding common shares of Susser (the  ETP Merger ). The ETP Merger was completed on August 29, 2014. By acquiring Susser, ETP acquired   100%   of the non-economic general partner interest and incentive distribution rights ( IDRs ) in the Partnership, which have subsequently been distributed to Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. ( ETE ). Additionally, ETP directly and indirectly acquired approximately   11.0 million   common and subordinated units in the Partnership (representing approximately   50.1%   of the then outstanding units). Unvested phantom units that were outstanding on April 27, 2014 vested upon completion of the ETP Merger. See Note 15 for further information. 
  Effective October 27, 2014, the Partnership changed its name from Susser Petroleum Partners LP (NYSE: SUSP) to Sunoco LP ( SUN , NYSE: SUN). This change aligned the Partnership's legal and marketing name with that of ETP's iconic brand, Sunoco. As used in this document, the terms  Partnership ,  SUN ,  we ,  us , or  our  should be understood to refer to Sunoco LP and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
  The consolidated financial statements are composed of Sunoco LP, a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, our majority-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities ( VIE s) in which we were the primary beneficiary (through December 23, 2015). We distribute motor fuels across more than   30   states throughout the East Coast, Midwest, and Southeast regions of the United States from Maine to Florida and from Florida to New Mexico, as well as Hawaii. We are also an operator of convenience retail stores across more than   20   states, primarily in Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, Florida, and Hawaii. 
  On October 1, 2014, we acquired   100%   of the membership interest of Mid-Atlantic Convenience Stores, LLC ( MACS ). On April 1, 2015, we acquired a   31.58%   membership interest and   50.1%   voting interest in Sunoco, LLC ( Sunoco LLC ). On July 31, 2015, we acquired   100%   of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Susser. Finally, on March 31, 2016 (effective January 1, 2016), we acquired the remaining   68.42%   membership interest and   49.9%   voting interest in Sunoco LLC as well as   100%   of the membership interest in Sunoco Retail LLC ( Sunoco Retail ). 
  Results of operations for the MACS, Sunoco LLC, Susser, and Sunoco Retail acquisitions, deemed transactions between entities under common control, have been included in our consolidated results of operations since September 1, 2014, the date of common control. 
  We operate our business as   two   segments, which are primarily engaged in wholesale fuel distribution and retail fuel and merchandise sales, respectively. Our primary operations are conducted by the following consolidated subsidiaries: 
  Wholesale Subsidiaries 
             
    Susser Petroleum Operating Company LLC ( SPOC ), a Delaware limited liability company, distributes motor fuel to Stripes  retail locations, consignment locations, as well as third party customers in Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. 
                
    Sunoco Energy Services LLC, a Texas limited liability company, distributes motor fuels, propane and lubricating oils, primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Kansas. 
                
    Sunoco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, primarily distributes motor fuels in more than   26   states throughout the East Coast, Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States. 
                
    Southside Oil, LLC, a Virginia limited liability company, distributes motor fuel, primarily in Georgia, Maryland, New York, Tennessee, and Virginia. 
                
    Aloha Petroleum LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, distributes motor fuel and operates terminal facilities on the Hawaiian Islands. 
     Retail Subsidiaries 
             
    Susser Petroleum Property Company LLC ( PropCo ), a Delaware limited liability company, primarily owns and leases convenience store properties. 
                
    Susser, a Delaware corporation, sells motor fuel and merchandise in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma through Stripes-branded convenience stores and transports motor fuel under GoPetro Transport LLC. 
     
   5 

Sunoco Retail, a Pennsylvania limited liability company, owns and operates convenience stores that sell motor fuel and merchandise primarily in Pennsylvania, New York, and Florida. 
                
    MACS Retail LLC, a Virginia limited liability company, owns and operates convenience stores, primarily in Virginia, Maryland, and Tennessee. 
                
    Aloha Petroleum, Ltd. ( Aloha ), a Hawaii corporation, owns and operates convenience stores on the Hawaiian Islands. 
       
  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Certain items have been reclassified for presentation purposes to conform to the accounting policies of the consolidated entity. These reclassifications had no impact on gross margin, income from operations, net income and comprehensive income, or the balance sheets or statements of cash flows. 
   
           2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     Interim Financial Statements 
  The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Pursuant to Regulation S-X, certain information and disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The consolidated financial statements and notes included herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016 and on our Form 8-K filed on July 15, 2016. 
  Significant Accounting Policies 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no changes in significant accounting policies from those described in the   December 31, 2015   audited consolidated financial statements. 
  Motor Fuel and Sales Taxes 
  Certain motor fuel and sales taxes are collected from customers and remitted to governmental agencies either directly by the Partnership or through suppliers. The Partnership s accounting policy for wholesale direct sales to dealer and commercial customers is to exclude the collected motor fuel tax from sales and cost of sales. 
  For retail locations where the Partnership holds inventory, including consignment arrangements, motor fuel sales and motor fuel cost of sales include motor fuel taxes. Such amounts were   $306.8 million   and   $303.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $888.3 million   and   $878.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Merchandise sales and cost of merchandise sales are reported net of sales tax in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  FASB ASU No. 2016-02.   In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02    Leases (Topic 842)    which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creates Topic 842, Leases. This Topic requires Balance Sheet recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP, excluding short-term leases of 12 months or less. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures. 
  FASB ASU No. 2016-15.   In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)    which institutes a number of modifications to presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. These modifications include (a) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (b) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (c) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (d) proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims, (e) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, (f) distributions received from equity method investees, (g) beneficial interest obtained in a securitization of financial assets, (h) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated statements of cash flows and related disclosures.

    Acquisitions 
     Sunoco LLC and Sunoco Retail LLC Acquisitions 
  On April 1, 2015, we acquired a   31.58%   membership interest and   50.1%   voting interest in Sunoco LLC from ETP Retail Holdings, LLC ( ETP Retail ), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ETP, for total consideration of approximately   $775.0 million   in cash (the  Sunoco Cash Consideration ) and   $40.8 million   in common units representing limited partner interests of the Partnership, based on the five day volume weighted average price of the Partnership s common units as of March 20, 2015. The Sunoco Cash Consideration was financed through issuance by the Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sunoco Finance Corp. ( SUN Finance ), of   6.375%   Senior Notes due 2023 on April 1, 2015. The common units issued to ETP Retail were issued and sold in a private transaction exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). Pursuant to the terms of the Sunoco LLC Contribution Agreement, ETP guaranteed all of the obligations of ETP Retail. 
  On November 15, 2015, we entered into a Contribution Agreement (the  ETP Dropdown Contribution Agreement ) with Sunoco LLC, Sunoco, Inc., ETP Retail, our General Partner and ETP. Pursuant to the terms of the ETP Dropdown Contribution Agreement, we agreed to acquire from ETP Retail, effective January 1, 2016, (a)   100%   of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Sunoco Retail, an entity that was formed by Sunoco, Inc. (R M), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Sunoco, Inc., prior to the closing of the ETP Dropdown Contribution Agreement, and (b)   68.42%   of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Sunoco LLC (the  ETP Dropdown ). Pursuant to the terms of the ETP Dropdown Contribution Agreement, ETP agreed to guarantee all of the obligations of ETP Retail. 
  Immediately prior to the closing of the ETP Dropdown, Sunoco Retail owned all of the retail assets previously owned by Sunoco, Inc. (R M), the ethanol plant located in Fulton, NY,   100%   of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Sunmarks, LLC, and all the retail assets previously owned by Atlantic Refining   Marketing Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sunoco, Inc. 
  Subject to the terms and conditions of the ETP Dropdown Contribution Agreement, at the closing of the ETP Dropdown, we paid to ETP Retail approximately   $2.2 billion   in cash on March 31, 2016, which included working capital adjustments, and issued to ETP Retail   5,710,922   common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the  ETP Dropdown Unit Consideration ). The ETP Dropdown was funded with borrowings under a term loan agreement. The ETP Dropdown Unit Consideration was issued in a private transaction exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
  The acquisitions of Sunoco LLC and Sunoco Retail were accounted for as transactions between entities under common control. Specifically, the Partnership recognized the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their respective carrying values with   no   goodwill created. The Partnership s results of operations include Sunoco LLC s and Sunoco Retail s results of operations beginning September 1, 2014, the date of common control. As a result, the Partnership retrospectively adjusted its financial statements to include the balances and operations of Sunoco LLC and Sunoco Retail from August 31, 2014. Accordingly, the Partnership retrospectively adjusted its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income to include   $2.4 billion   of Sunoco LLC revenues and   $24.5 million   of net income for the three months ended March 31, 2015, as well as   $1.1 billion   of Sunoco Retail revenues and   $5.7 million   of net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The equity of Sunoco LLC and Sunoco Retail prior to the respective acquisitions is presented as predecessor equity in our consolidated financial statements. 
  The following table summarizes the final recording of assets and liabilities at their respective carrying values (in thousands):

Susser Acquisition 
  On July 31, 2015, we acquired   100%   of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Susser from Heritage Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ETP ( HHI ), and ETP Holdco Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ETP ( ETP Holdco  and together with HHI, the  Contributors ), for total consideration of approximately   $966.9 million   in cash (the  Susser Cash Consideration ), subject to certain post-closing working capital adjustments, and issued to the Contributors   21,978,980   Class B Units representing limited partner interests of the Partnership ( Class B Units ) (the  Susser Acquisition ). The Class B Units were identical to the common units in all respects, except such Class B Units were not entitled to distributions payable with respect to the second quarter of 2015. The Class B Units converted, on a one-for-one basis, into common units on August 19, 2015. 
  Pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement dated as of July 14, 2015 among Susser, HHI, ETP Holdco, our General Partner, and ETP (the  Susser Contribution Agreement ), (i) Susser caused its wholly owned subsidiary to exchange its   79,308   common units for   79,308   Class A Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership ( Class A Units ) and (ii) the   10,939,436   subordinated units held by wholly owned subsidiaries of Susser were converted into   10,939,436   Class A Units. The Class A Units were entitled to receive distributions on a pro rata basis with the common units, except that the Class A Units (a) did not share in distributions of cash to the extent such cash was derived from or attributable to any distribution received by the Partnership from PropCo, the Partnership s indirect wholly owned subsidiary, the proceeds of any sale of the membership interests of PropCo, or any interest or principal payments received by the Partnership with respect to indebtedness of PropCo or its subsidiaries and (b) were subordinated to the common units during the subordination period for the subordinated units and were not entitled to receive any distributions until holders of the common units had received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters. 
  In addition, the Partnership issued   79,308   common units and   10,939,436   subordinated units to the Contributors (together with the Class B Units, the  Susser Unit Consideration ) to restore the economic benefit of common units and subordinated units held by wholly owned subsidiaries of Susser that were exchanged or converted, as applicable, into Class A Units. The Susser Unit Consideration was issued and sold to the Contributors in private transactions exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Pursuant to the terms of the Susser Contribution Agreement, ETP guaranteed all then existing obligations of the Contributors. 
  The Susser Acquisition was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. Specifically, the Partnership recognized acquired assets and assumed liabilities at their respective carrying values with no additional goodwill created. The Partnership s results of operations include Susser s results of operations beginning September 1, 2014, the date of common control. As a result, the Partnership retrospectively adjusted its financial statements to include the balances and operations of Susser from August 31, 2014. Accordingly, the Partnership retrospectively adjusted its Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income to include   $2.6 billion   of Susser revenues and   $18.1 million   of net income for the period from January 1, 2015 to July 31, 2015. 
  The following table summarizes the final recording of assets and liabilities at their respective carrying values as of the date presented (in thousands): 

Emerge Fuels Business Acquisition  
  On August 31, 2016, we acquired the fuels business (the "Fuels Business") from Emerge Energy Services LP (NYSE: EMES) ("Emerge") for   $171.5 million  , inclusive of working capital and other adjustments, which was funded using amounts available under our revolving credit facility. The Fuels Business includes   two   transmix processing plants with attached refined product terminals located in the Birmingham, Alabama and greater Dallas, Texas metro areas and engages in the processing of transmix and the distribution of refined fuels. Combined, the plants can process over   10,000   barrels per day of transmix, and the associated terminals have over   800,000   barrels of storage capacity. 
  
   8 

Management, with the assistance of a third party valuation firm, determined the preliminary assessment of fair value of assets and liabilities at the date of the Fuels Business acquisition. We determined the preliminary value of goodwill by giving consideration to the following qualitative factors: 
             
    synergies created through increased fuel purchasing advantages and integration with our existing wholesale business; 
                
    strategic advantages of owning transmix processing plants and increasing our terminal capacity; and 
                
    competitors processing transmix in the geographic region. 
     Management is reviewing the valuation and confirming the results to determine the final purchase price allocation. As a result, material adjustments to this preliminary allocation may occur in the future. 
  The following table summarizes the preliminary recording of assets and liabilities at their respective carrying values as of the date presented (in thousands): 

The Fuels Business acquisition was treated as an asset purchase transaction for tax purposes. As such, any goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. 
  Other Acquisitions 
  On June 22, 2016, we acquired   14   convenience stores and the wholesale fuel business in the Austin, Houston, and Waco, Texas markets from Kolkhorst Petroleum Inc. for   $37.9 million   plus the value of inventory on hand at closing. As part of the acquisition, we  acquired   5   fee properties and   9   leased properties, all of which are company operated. The Kolkhorst acquisition also included supply contracts with dealer-owned and operated sites. This acquisition was funded using amounts available under our revolving credit facility with the total purchase consideration allocated to assets acquired based on the preliminary estimate of their respective fair values on the purchase date. Management is reviewing the valuation and confirming the results to determine the final purchase price allocation. As a result, material adjustments to this preliminary allocation may occur in the future. The acquisition preliminarily increased goodwill by   $8.7 million  . 
  On June 22, 2016, we acquired   18   convenience stores serving the upstate New York market from Valentine Stores, Inc. ( Valentine ) for   $76.2 million   plus the value of inventory on hand at closing. As part of the Valentine acquisition, we acquired   19   fee properties, of which   18   are company operated stores and   one   is a standalone Tim Hortons,   one   leased Tim Hortons property and   three   raw tracts of land in fee for future store development. This acquisition was funded using amounts available under our revolving credit facility with the total purchase consideration allocated to assets acquired based on the preliminary estimate of their respective fair values on the purchase date. Management is reviewing the valuation and confirming the results to determine the final purchase price allocation. As a result, material adjustments to this preliminary allocation may occur in the future. The acquisition preliminarily increased goodwill by   $35.2 million  . 
  On December 16, 2015, we acquired a wholesale motor fuel distribution business serving the Northeastern United States from Alta East, Inc. ( Alta East ) for approximately   $57.1 million   plus the value of inventory on hand at closing (the  Alta East Acquisition ). As part of the Alta East Acquisition, we acquired   24   fee and   6   leased properties operated by third party dealers or commission agents, and   two   non-operating surplus locations in fee. The Alta East Acquisition also included supply contracts with the dealer-owned and operated sites. The Alta East Acquisition was funded using amounts available under our revolving credit facility with the total purchase consideration allocated to assets acquired based on the preliminary estimate of their respective fair values at the purchase date. Management is reviewing the valuation and confirming the results to determine the final purchase price allocation.

    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
     Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The annual impairment test is performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $3.2 billion   and   $3.1 billion  , respectively, of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. The 2015 impairment analysis indicated   no   impairment in goodwill. During 2016, we continued our evaluation of the Emerge, Kolkhorst, Valentine, and Alta East acquisitions' purchase accounting analysis with the assistance of a third party valuation firm. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we evaluated potential impairment indicators. We believe no impairment events occurred during the   third   quarter of   2016  , and we believe the assumptions used in the analysis performed in 2015 are still relevant and indicative of our current operating environment. As a result,   no   impairment was recorded to goodwill during the period from January 1, 2016 through   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Partnership has indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded that are not amortized. These indefinite-lived assets consist of tradenames, contractual rights, and liquor licenses. Tradenames and liquor licenses relate to our retail segment while contractual rights relate to our wholesale segment. 
  The Partnership has finite-lived intangible assets recorded that are amortized. The finite-lived assets consist of supply agreements, customer relations, favorable leasehold arrangements, non-competes, and loan origination costs, all of which are amortized over the respective lives of the agreements or over the period of time the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the Partnership's future cash flows. Customer relations and supply agreements have a remaining weighted-average life of approximately   9   years. Favorable leasehold arrangements have a remaining weighted-average life of approximately   11   years. Non-competition agreements and other intangible assets have a remaining weighted-average life of approximately   7   years. Loan origination costs have a remaining weighted-average life of approximately   3   years. 
  Prior to December 31, 2014, our Stripes and Laredo Taco Company tradenames were amortized over   30   years. As of January 1, 2015, management deemed the Stripes and Laredo Taco Company tradenames to be indefinite-lived assets and ceased amortization.  
  We evaluate the estimated benefit periods and recoverability of other intangible assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the lives may not be appropriate and/or the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value is not recoverable, impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value.

Term Loan 
  On March 31, 2016, we entered into a term loan agreement (the  Term Loan ) to finance a portion of the costs associated with the ETP Dropdown. The Term Loan provides secured financing in an aggregate principal amount of up to   $2.035 billion  , which we borrowed in full. The Partnership used the proceeds to fund a portion of the ETP Dropdown and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the ETP Dropdown and Term Loan. 
  Obligations under the Term Loan are secured equally and ratably with the 2014 Revolver (as defined below) by substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the Partnership and certain of our subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. Obligations under the Term Loan are guaranteed by certain of the Partnership s subsidiaries. In addition, ETP Retail provided a limited contingent guaranty of collection with respect to the payment of the principal amount of the Term Loan. The maturity date of the Term Loan is October 1, 2019. The Partnership is not required to make any amortization payments with respect to the loans under the Term Loan. Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan bear interest at either LIBOR or base rate plus an applicable margin based on the election of the Partnership for each interest period. Until the Partnership first receives an investment grade rating, the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans ranges from   1.500%   to   2.500%   and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from   0.500%   to   1.500%  , in each case based on the Partnership s leverage ratio. 
  The Partnership may voluntarily prepay borrowings under the Term Loan at any time without premium or penalty, subject to any applicable breakage costs for loans bearing interest at LIBOR. Under certain circumstances, the Partnership is required to repay borrowings under the Term Loan in connection with the issuance by the Partnership of certain types of indebtedness for borrowed money. The Term Loan also includes certain (i) representations and warranties, (ii) affirmative covenants, including delivery of financial and other information to the administrative agent, notice to the administrative agent upon the occurrence of certain material events, preservation of existence, payment of material taxes and other claims, maintenance of properties and insurance, access to properties and records for inspection by administrative agent and lenders, further assurances and provision of additional guarantees and collateral, (iii) negative  
  
   12 

covenants, including restrictions on the Partnership and our restricted subsidiaries  ability to merge and consolidate with other companies, incur indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make loans, advances or investments, pay dividends, sell or otherwise transfer assets or enter into transactions with shareholders or affiliates, and (iv) events of default, in each case substantially similar to the representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default in the Partnership s existing revolving credit facility. 
  The Term Loan also requires the maintenance of a maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio (i) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through March 31, 2017, of   6.25   to 1.0 at any time with respect to the Partnership and (ii) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter, of   5.5   to 1.0 at any time with respect to the Partnership (subject to increases to   6.0   to 1.0 in connection with certain future specified acquisitions). During the continuance of an event of default, the lenders under the Term Loan may take a number of actions, including declaring the entire amount then outstanding under the Term Loan due and payable.

ETP Retail provided a guarantee of collection to the 2021 Issuers with respect to the payment of the principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes. ETP Retail is not subject to any of the covenants under the 2021 Indenture.  
  Net proceeds of approximately   $789.4 million   were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our Term Loan. 
  In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers pursuant to which we agreed to complete an offer to exchange the 2021 Senior Notes for an issue of registered notes with terms substantially identical to the 2021 Senior Notes on or before April 7, 2017. The exchange offer was completed on October 4, 2016.

The terms of the 2020 Senior Notes are governed by an indenture dated July 20, 2015, among the 2020 Issuers, our General Partner, and certain other subsidiaries of the Partnership (the  2020 Guarantors ) and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the  2020 Trustee ). The 2020 Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2020 and interest is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing February 1, 2016. The 2020 Senior Notes are senior obligations of the 2020 Issuers and are guaranteed on a senior basis by all of the Partnership s existing subsidiaries. The 2020 Senior Notes and guarantees are unsecured and rank equally with all of the 2020 Issuers  and each 2020 Guarantor s existing and future senior obligations.

The terms of the 2023 Senior Notes are governed by an indenture dated April 1, 2015, among the 2023 Issuers, our General Partner, and certain other subsidiaries of the Partnership (the  2023 Guarantors ) and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the  2023 Trustee ).

  Net proceeds of approximately   $786.5 million   were used to fund Sunoco Cash Consideration and to repay borrowings under our 2014 Revolver (as defined below).  
  In connection with our issuance of the 2023 Senior Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers pursuant to which we agreed to complete an offer to exchange the 2023 Senior Notes for an issue of registered notes with terms substantially identical to the 2023 Senior Notes on or before April 1, 2016. The exchange offer was completed on October 4, 2016 and we paid the holders of the 2023 Senior Notes an aggregate of   $1.6 million   in liquidated damages in the form of additional interest as a result of the delayed registration. 
  Revolving Credit Agreement 
  On September 25, 2014, we entered into a new   $1.25 billion   revolving credit facility (the  2014 Revolver ) with a syndicate of banks expiring September 25, 2019 (which date may be extended in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Revolver). The 2014 Revolver includes an accordion feature providing flexibility to increase the facility by an additional   $250 million  , subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the 2014 Revolver were used to repay and cancel the   $400 million   revolving credit facility (the  2012 Revolver ) entered into in connection with the IPO. 
  Borrowings under the 2014 Revolver bear interest at a base rate (a rate based off of the higher of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined therein) plus   0.50%  , (ii) Bank of America s prime rate or (iii) one-month LIBOR (as defined therein) plus   1.00%  ) or LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from   1.50%   to   2.50%  , in the case of a LIBOR loan, or from   0.50%   to   1.50%  , in the case of a base rate loan (determined with reference to the Partnership s Leverage Ratio (as defined therein)). Upon the first achievement by the Partnership of an investment grade credit rating, the applicable margin will decrease to a range of   1.125%   to   2.0%  , in the case of a LIBOR loan, or from   0.125%   to   1.00%  , in the case of a base rate loan (determined with reference to the credit rating for the Partnership s senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt). Interest is payable quarterly if the base rate applies, at the end of the applicable interest period if LIBOR applies and at the end of the month if daily floating LIBOR applies. In addition, the unused portion of the 2014 Revolver is subject to a commitment fee ranging from   0.250%   to   0.350%  , based on the Partnership s Leverage Ratio (as defined therein). Upon the first achievement by the Partnership of an investment grade credit rating, the commitment fee will decrease to a range of   0.125%   to   0.275%  , based on the Partnership s credit rating as described above. 
  The 2014 Revolver requires the Partnership to maintain a Leverage Ratio of not more than   5.50   to 1.00. The maximum Leverage Ratio is subject to upwards adjustment of not more than   6.00   to 1.00 for a period not to exceed three fiscal quarters in the event the Partnership engages in an acquisition of assets, equity interests (as defined therein), operating lines or divisions by the Partnership, a subsidiary (as defined therein), an unrestricted subsidiary (as defined therein) or a joint venture for a purchase price of not less than   $50 million  . Effective April 8, 2015, in connection with the Sunoco LLC acquisition, we entered into a Specified Acquisition Period (as defined in the 2014 Revolver) in which our leverage ratio compliance requirements were adjusted upward. Such Specified Acquisition Period ended on August 19, 2015, and concurrently in connection with the Susser acquisition, we entered into a new Specified Acquisition Period. On December 2, 2015, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the ETP Dropdown Contribution Agreement, we entered into an amendment to the 2014 Revolver to temporarily increase the maximum leverage ratio to   6.25   to 1.00 for the period beginning upon the closing of the ETP Dropdown through the fourth quarterly testing date following the closing of the ETP Dropdown (the  Post Dropdown Period ). 
  Indebtedness under the 2014 Revolver is secured by a security interest in, among other things, all of the Partnership s present and future personal property and all of the present and future personal property of its guarantors, the capital stock of its material subsidiaries (or   66%   of the capital stock of material foreign subsidiaries), and any intercompany debt. Upon the first achievement by the Partnership of an investment grade credit rating, all security interests securing the 2014 Revolver will be released.

On April 10, 2015, the Partnership entered into the First Amendment to Credit Agreement and Increase Agreement (the  First Amendment ) with the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders thereto severally agreed to (i) provide   $250 million   in aggregate incremental commitments under the 2014 Revolver and (ii) make certain amendments to the 2014 Revolver as described in the First Amendment. After giving effect to the First Amendment, the 2014 Revolver permits the Partnership to borrow up to   $1.5 billion   on a revolving credit basis. 
  On December 2, 2015, the Partnership entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the  Second Amendment ) with the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as a letter of credit issuer, as swing line lender, and as administrative agent pursuant to which the lenders thereto generally agreed to, among other matters, (i) permit the incurrence of a term loan credit facility in connection with the consummation of the ETP Dropdown, (ii) permit such term loan credit facility to be secured on a pari passu basis with the indebtedness incurred under the Credit Agreement (as amended by the Amendment) pursuant to a collateral trust arrangement whereby a financial institution agrees to act as common collateral agent for all pari passu indebtedness and (iii)  temporarily increase the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the 2014 Revolver (as amended by the Second Amendment) in connection with the consummation of the ETP Dropdown. 
  On August 1, 2016, the Partnership entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the  Third Amendment ) with the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as a letter of credit issuer, as swing line lender, and as administrative agent to, among other matters, conform certain terms of the Credit Agreement to certain terms of the Partnership s term loan credit facility dated as of March 31, 2016. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance on the 2014 Revolver was   $958.2 million  , and   $23.6 million   in standby letters of credit were outstanding. The unused availability on the 2014 Revolver at   September 30, 2016   was   $518.2 million  . The Partnership was in compliance with all financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Sale Leaseback Financing Obligation  
  On April 4, 2013, MACS completed a sale leaseback transaction with   two   separate companies for   50   of its dealer operated sites. As MACS did not meet the criteria for sale leaseback accounting, this transaction was accounted for as a financing arrangement over the course of the lease agreement. The obligations mature in varying dates through 2033, require monthly interest and principal payments, and bear interest at   5.125%  . The obligation related to this transaction is included in long-term debt and the balance outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   was   $118.6 million  . 
  Other Debt 
  On July 8, 2010, we entered into a mortgage note for an aggregate initial borrowing amount of   $1.2 million  . Pursuant to the terms of the mortgage note, we make monthly installment payments that are comprised of principal and interest through the maturity date of July 1, 2016. The balance outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   zero   and   $1.0 million  , respectively. The mortgage note bears interest at a fixed rate of   6.0%  . The mortgage note is secured by a first priority security interest in a property owned by the Partnership. 
  In September 2013, we assumed a   $3.0 million   term loan as part of the acquisition of Gainesville Fuel, Inc. (now Sunoco Energy Services LLC). The balance outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   zero   and   $2.5 million  , respectively. The term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of   4.0%  . 
   
           10. 
    Fair Value Measurements 
      We use fair value measurements to measure, among other items, purchased assets and investments, leases and derivative contracts. We also use them to assess impairment of properties, equipment, intangible assets and goodwill. Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or is derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, use of unobservable prices or inputs is used to estimate the current fair value, often using an internal valuation model. These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the item being valued. 
  ASC 820    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures    prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following hierarchy: 
           Level 1 
    Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
              Level 2 
    Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; 
     
   15 

Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing. 
     The estimated fair value of debt is calculated using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of debt as of   September 30, 2016  , is estimated to be approximately   $4.6 billion  , based on outstanding balances as of the end of the period using current interest rates for similar securities.  
   
           11. 
    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Leases 
  The Partnership leases certain convenience store and other properties under non-cancellable operating leases whose initial terms are typically   5   to   15   years, with some having a term of 40 years or more, along with options that permit renewals for additional periods. Minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition, certain leases require additional contingent payments based on sales or motor fuel volumes. We typically are responsible for payment of real estate taxes, maintenance expenses and insurance. These properties are either sublet to third parties or used for our convenience store operations. 
  Net rent expense consisted of the following (in thousands):

As a partnership, we are generally not subject to federal income tax and most state income taxes. However, the Partnership conducts certain activities through corporate subsidiaries which are subject to federal and state income taxes. 
  Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to Partnership earnings that are not subject to U.S. federal and most state income taxes at the Partnership level. A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory rate to net income tax expense is as follow (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016  , ETE and ETP or their subsidiaries owned   45,750,826   common units, which constitute   40.9%   of the limited partner ownership interest in us. As of   September 30, 2016  , our fully consolidating subsidiaries owned   16,410,780   Class C units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the  Class C Units ) and the public owned   49,588,960   common units. 
  Common Units 
  In connection with the closing of the Partnership s previously announced sale (the  PIPE Transaction ) of   2,263,158   common units in a private placement to ETE, the Partnership entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of March 31, 2016 (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), with ETE. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Partnership is required to file a shelf registration statement to register the common units, upon the request of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding common units. The Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the registration statement within   45   days of any such request and cause it to be effective as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, subject to certain exceptions. ETE owns the general partner interests and incentive distribution rights in the Partnership. 
  Activity of our common units for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is as follows:  

Allocations of Net Income 
  Our partnership agreement contains provisions for the allocation of net income and loss to the unitholders. For purposes of maintaining partner capital accounts, the partnership agreement specifies that items of income and loss shall be allocated among the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interest. Normal allocations according to percentage interests are made after giving effect, if any, to priority income allocations in an amount equal to incentive cash distributions allocated   100%   to ETE.

The calculation of net income allocated to the partners is as follows (in thousands, except per unit amounts): 

Class C Units  
  On January 1, 2016, the Partnership issued an aggregate of   16,410,780   Class C Units consisting of (i)   5,242,113   Class C Units that were issued by the Partnership to Aloha as consideration for the contribution by Aloha to an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership of all of Aloha s assets relating to the wholesale supply of fuel and lubricants, and (ii)   11,168,667   Class C Units that were issued by the Partnership to indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Partnership in exchange for all of the outstanding Class A Units held by such subsidiaries. The Class C Units were valued at   $38.5856   per Class C Unit (the  Class C Unit Issue Price ), based on the volume-weighted average price of the Partnership s Common Units for the   five  -day trading period ending on December 31, 2015. The Class C Units were issued in private transactions exempt from registration under section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
  Class C Units (i) are not convertible or exchangeable into Common Units or any other units of the Partnership and are non-redeemable; (ii) are entitled to receive distributions of available cash of the Partnership (other than available cash derived from or attributable to any distribution received by the Partnership from PropCo, the proceeds of any sale of the membership interests of PropCo, or any interest or principal payments received by the Partnership with respect to indebtedness of PropCo or its subsidiaries), at a fixed rate equal to   $0.8682   per quarter for each Class C Unit outstanding, (iii) do not have the right to vote on any matter except as otherwise required by any non-waivable provision of law, (iv) are not allocated any items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit attributable to the Partnership s ownership of, or sale or other disposition of, the membership interests of PropCo, or the Partnership s ownership of any indebtedness of PropCo or any of its subsidiaries ( PropCo Items ), (v) will be allocated gross income (other than from PropCo Items) in an amount equal to the cash distributed to the holders of Class C Units and (vi) will be allocated depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions as if the Class C Units were Common Units and   1%   of certain allocations of net termination gain (other than from PropCo Items). 
  Pursuant to the terms described above, these distributions do not have an impact on the Partnership s consolidated cash flows and as such, are excluded from total cash distributions and allocation of limited partners  interest in net income. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Class C distributions declared totaled   $42.7 million  .

Incentive Distribution Rights 
  The following table illustrates the percentage allocations of available cash from operating surplus between our common unitholders and the holder of our IDRs based on the specified target distribution levels, after the payment of distributions to Class C unitholders. The amounts set forth under  marginal percentage interest in distributions  are the percentage interests of our IDR holder and the common unitholders in any available cash from operating surplus we distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in the column  total quarterly distribution per unit target amount.  The percentage interests shown for our common unitholders and our IDR holder for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution. Effective August 21, 2015, ETE exchanged   21.0 million   ETP common units, owned by ETE, the owner of ETP s general partner interest, for   100%   of the general partner interest and all of our IDRs. ETP had previously owned our IDRs since September 2014, prior to that date the IDRs were owned by Susser. 

Cash Distributions 
  Our partnership agreement, as amended, sets forth the calculation to be used to determine the amount and priority of cash distributions that the common unitholders receive. 
  The following table presents our cash distributions paid or payable during 2016 (in thousands, except for per unit distributions):

    Unit-Based Compensation 
     Unit-based compensation expense related to the Partnership included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income was as follows (in thousands): 

Phantom Common Unit Awards 
  Prior to the ETP Merger, there were phantom unit awards issued to certain directors and employees under the Sunoco LP 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The fair value of each phantom unit on the grant date was equal to the market price of our common unit on that date reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over the vesting period, since the phantom units did not receive dividends until vested. The estimated fair value of our phantom units was amortized over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Non-employee director awards vested over a   one  -to-  three   year period and employee awards vested ratably over a   two  -to-  five   year service period. Concurrent with the ETP Merger, all unvested phantom units vested and compensation cost of   $0.4 million   was recognized. 
  
   19 

Subsequent to the ETP Merger, phantom units were issued which also have the right to receive distributions prior to vesting. The units vest   60%   after three years and   40%   after five years. The fair value of these units is the market prices of our common units on the grant date, and is amortized over the five-year vesting period using the straight-line method. Unrecognized compensation cost related to our nonvested restricted phantom units totaled   $27.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   2.74   years. The fair value of nonvested service phantom units outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $45.1 million  . 
  A summary of our phantom unit award activity is as follows: 

Cash Awards 
  In January 2015, the Partnership granted   30,710   awards that are settled in cash under the terms of the Sunoco LP Long-Term Cash Restricted Unit Plan. An additional   1,000   awards were granted in September 2015. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   3,470   units were forfeited. These awards do not have the right to receive distributions prior to vesting. The awards vest   100%   after   three years  . Unrecognized compensation cost related to our nonvested cash awards totaled   $0.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   1.18   years. The fair value of nonvested cash awards outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $1.4 million  . 
   
   Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. We operate our business in   two   primary segments, wholesale and retail, both of which are included as reportable segments. No operating segments have been aggregated in identifying the   two   reportable segments. 
  We allocate shared revenue and costs to each segment based on the way our CODM measures segment performance. Partnership overhead costs, interest and other expenses not directly attributable to a reportable segment are allocated based on segment gross profit. These costs were previously allocated based on segment EBITDA. 
  We report EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by segment as a measure of segment performance. We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA to include adjustments for non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposal of assets, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and inventory fair value adjustments. 
  Wholesale Segment 
  Our wholesale segment purchases motor fuel primarily from independent refiners and major oil companies and supplies it to our retail segment, to independently-operated dealer stations under long-term supply agreements, and to distributers and other consumers of motor fuel. Also included in the wholesale segment are motor fuel sales to consignment locations and sales and costs related to processing transmix. We distribute motor fuels across more than   30   states throughout the East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States from Maine to Florida and from Florida to New Mexico, as well as Hawaii. Sales of fuel from the wholesale segment to our retail segment are delivered at cost plus a profit margin. These amounts are reflected in intercompany eliminations of motor fuel revenue and motor fuel cost of sales. Also included in our wholesale segment is rental income from properties that we lease or sub-lease. 
  Retail Segment 
  Our retail segment operates branded retail convenience stores across more than   20   states throughout the East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States with a significant presence in Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Virginia, and Hawaii. These stores offer motor fuel, merchandise, foodservice, and a variety of other services including car washes, lottery, ATM, money orders, prepaid phone cards and wireless services.

The following tables present financial information by segment for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):

Net income per unit applicable to limited partners (including subordinated unitholders prior to the conversion of our subordinated units on November 30, 2015) is computed by dividing limited partners  interest in net income by the weighted-average number of outstanding common and subordinated units. Our net income is allocated to the limited partners in accordance with their respective partnership percentages, after giving effect to any priority income allocations for incentive distributions and distributions on employee unit awards. Earnings in excess of distributions are allocated to the limited partners based on their respective ownership interests. Payments made to our unitholders are determined in relation to actual distributions declared and are not based on the net income allocations used in the calculation of net income per unit. 
  In addition to the common and subordinated units, we identify the IDRs as participating securities and use the two-class method when calculating net income per unit applicable to limited partners, which is based on the weighted-average number of common units outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per unit includes the effects of potentially dilutive units on our common units, consisting of unvested phantom units. Basic and diluted net income per unit applicable to subordinated limited partners are the same because there are no potentially dilutive subordinated units outstanding.

A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per unit computations is as follows (in thousands, except units and per unit amounts):

This profit margin is eliminated through consolidation from the date of common control, September 1, 2014, and thereafter, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
  We are party to the Sunoco Distribution Contract, a   10  -year agreement under which Sunoco LLC is the exclusive wholesale distributor of motor fuel to Sunoco Retail s convenience stores. Pursuant to the agreement, pricing is cost plus a fixed margin of   four   cents per gallon. This profit margin is eliminated through consolidation from the date of common control, September 1, 2014, and thereafter, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. 
  In connection with the closing of our IPO on September 25, 2012, we also entered into an Omnibus Agreement with Susser (the  Omnibus Agreement ). Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, among other things, the Partnership received a   three  -year option to purchase from Susser up to   75   of Susser's new or recently constructed Stripes convenience stores at Susser's cost and lease the stores back to Susser at a specified rate for a   15  -year initial term. The Partnership is the exclusive distributor of motor fuel to such stores for a period of   10   years from the date of purchase. During 2015, we completed all   75   sale-leaseback transactions under the Omnibus Agreement.

Overview 
  As used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the terms  Partnership ,  SUN ,  we ,  us , or  our  should be understood to refer to Sunoco LP and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
  We are a growth-oriented Delaware master limited partnership engaged in the retail sale of motor fuels and merchandise through our company-operated convenience stores and retail fuel sites, as well as the wholesale distribution of motor fuels to convenience stores, independent dealers, commercial customers and distributors. Additionally, through Sunoco LLC, we are the exclusive wholesale supplier of the iconic Sunoco-branded motor fuel, supplying an extensive distribution network of approximately 5,315 Sunoco-branded company and third-party operated locations throughout the East Coast, Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States including approximately 210 company-operated Sunoco-branded Stripes locations in Texas. 
  We are managed by our General Partner. ETE, a publicly traded master limited partnership, owns 100% of the membership interests in our General Partner, a 2.0% limited partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights.  ETP, another publicly traded master limited partnership which is also controlled by ETE, owns a 38.9% limited partner interest in us. Additional information is provided in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In late 2015, we announced plans to open a corporate office in Dallas, Texas. Certain employees are relocating to Dallas from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Houston, Texas and Corpus Christi, Texas. We currently estimate the costs to be incurred in 2016 will be approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million, but do not expect such costs to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  On March 31, 2016 (effective January 1, 2016), we completed the acquisition from ETP Retail, of (i) the remaining 68.42% membership interest and 49.9% voting interest in Sunoco LLC and (ii) 100% of the membership interest of Sunoco Retail, which immediately prior to the acquisition owned all of the retail assets previously owned by Sunoco, Inc. (R M), the ethanol plant located in Fulton, NY, 100% of the interests in Sunmarks, LLC and all of the retail assets previously owned by Atlantic Refining and Marketing Corp. (See Note 3 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).  
  We believe we are one of the largest independent motor fuel distributors by gallons in Texas and one of the largest distributors of Chevron, Exxon, and Valero branded motor fuels in the United States. In addition to distributing motor fuel, we also distribute other petroleum products such as propane and lube oil, and we receive rental income from real estate that we lease or sublease. Sales of fuel from our wholesale segment to our retail segment are delivered at a cost plus profit margin. 
  We purchase motor fuel primarily from independent refiners and major oil companies and distribute it across more than 30 states throughout the East Coast, Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, as well as Hawaii to approximately: 
             
    1,345 company-operated convenience stores and fuel outlets; 
                
    165 independently operated consignment locations where we sell motor fuel to retail customers under consignment arrangements with such operators; 
                
    5,430 convenience stores and retail fuel outlets operated by independent operators, which we refer to as  dealers  or   distributors,  pursuant to long-term distribution agreements; and 
                
    1,895 other commercial customers, including unbranded convenience stores, other fuel distributors, school districts, municipalities and other industrial customers. 
     Our retail segment operates approximately 1,345 convenience stores and fuel outlets. Our retail convenience stores operate under several brands, including our proprietary brands Stripes, APlus, and Aloha Island Mart, and offer a broad selection of food, beverages, snacks, grocery and non-food merchandise, motor fuel and other services. We sold 651.4 million and 1.9 billion retail motor fuel gallons at these sites during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. We opened fourteen new retail sites during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which is reflected in retail activity for the period. 
  We operate approximately 730 Stripes convenience stores that carry a broad selection of food, beverages, snacks, grocery and non-food merchandise. Our proprietary in-house Laredo Taco Company restaurant is implemented in approximately 455 Stripes convenience stores and we intend to implement it in all newly constructed Stripes convenience stores. Additionally, we have approximately 55 national branded restaurant offerings in our Stripes stores. 
  We operate approximately 455 retail convenience stores and fuel outlets primarily under our proprietary iconic Sunoco fuel brand and primarily located in Pennsylvania, New York, and Florida, including 400 APlus convenience stores. 
  We operate approximately 160 MACS and Aloha convenience stores and fuel outlets in Virginia, Maryland, Tennessee, Georgia, and Hawaii offering merchandise, foodservice, motor fuel and other services.

Recent Developments 
  On October 12, 2016, we completed the previously announced acquisition of the convenience store, wholesale motor fuel distribution, and commercial fuels distribution business serving East Texas and Louisiana from Denny Oil Company ( Denny ) for approximately $54.6 million plus inventory on hand at closing, subject to closing adjustments. This acquisition includes six company owned and operated locations, six company-owned and dealer operated locations, wholesale fuel supply contracts for a network of independent dealer-owned and dealer-operated locations, and a commercial fuels business in the Eastern Texas and Louisiana markets. As part of the acquisition, we acquired 13 fee properties, which included the six company operated locations, six dealer operated locations and a bulk plant and an office facility. This transaction was funded using amounts available under our revolving credit facility with the total purchase consideration allocated to assets acquired based on the preliminary estimate of their respective fair values on the purchase date.  
  On August 31, 2016, we acquired the fuels business (the "Fuels Business") from Emerge Energy Services LP (NYSE: EMES) ("Emerge") for $171.5 million, inclusive of working capital and other adjustments. The Fuels Business comprises Dallas-based Direct Fuels LLC and Birmingham-based Allied Energy Company LLC, both wholly owned subsidiaries of Emerge, and engages in the processing of transmix and the distribution of refined fuels. As part of the acquisition, we acquired two transmix processing plants with attached refined product terminals. Combined, the plants can process over 10,000 barrels per day of transmix, and the associated terminals have over 800,000 barrels of storage capacity. 
  On June 22, 2016, we acquired 14 convenience stores and the wholesale fuel business in the Austin, Houston, and Waco, Texas markets from Kolkhorst Petroleum Inc. for $37.9 million plus the value of inventory on hand at closing. As part of the acquisition, we acquired 5 fee properties and 9 leased properties, all of which are company operated. The Kolkhorst acquisition also included supply contracts with dealer-owned and operated sites. This acquisition was funded using amounts available under our revolving credit facility with the total purchase consideration allocated to assets acquired based on the preliminary estimate of their respective fair values on the purchase date. Management is reviewing the valuation and confirming the results to determine the final purchase price allocation. As a result, material adjustments to this preliminary allocation may occur in the future. The acquisition preliminarily increased goodwill by $8.7 million. 
  On June 22, 2016, we acquired 18 convenience stores serving the upstate New York market from Valentine Stores, Inc. ( Valentine ) for $76.2 million plus the value of inventory on hand at closing. As part of the Valentine acquisition, we acquired 19 fee properties, of which 18 are company operated stores and one is a standalone Tim Hortons, one leased Tim Hortons property and three raw tracts of land in fee for future store development. This acquisition was funded using amounts available under our revolving credit facility with the total purchase consideration allocated to assets acquired based on the preliminary estimate of their respective fair values on the purchase date. Management is reviewing the valuation and confirming the results to determine the final purchase price allocation. As a result, material adjustments to this preliminary allocation may occur in the future. The acquisition preliminarily increased goodwill by $35.2 million. 
  On May 2, 2016, we finalized an agreement with the Indiana Toll Road Concession Company to develop and operate 8 travel plazas along the 150-mile toll road. The agreement has a 20-year term with an estimated cost of $31 million. The first series of plaza reconstruction began in the third quarter of 2016, and the total construction period is expected to last two years. 
  On March 28, 2016, Aloha Petroleum entered into a Store Development Agreement with Dunkin  Donuts to be the exclusive developer of Dunkin  Donuts restaurants in the state of Hawaii for an initial term of eight years. Aloha has committed to building and operating 15 Dunkin  Donuts restaurants at an estimated cost of $20 million. Aloha anticipates that approximately half the restaurants will be built on existing Aloha-controlled (convenience store / gas station) properties and half will be standalone restaurants developed on properties that will be acquired in the future. 
   
  Key Operating Metrics 
  The following information is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance. We operate our business in two primary operating divisions, wholesale and retail, both of which are included as reportable segments. 
  Key operating metrics set forth below are presented as of and for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and have been derived from our historical consolidated financial statements. 
  
   27 

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning key measures we rely on to gauge our operating performance (in thousands, except gross profit per gallon): 

________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Excludes the impact of inventory fair value adjustments consistent with the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. 
              (2) 
    We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA to include adjustments for non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposal of assets, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and inventory fair value adjustments. We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense including the accrual of interest expense related to our 2020 and 2023 Senior Notes that is paid on a semi-annual basis, current income tax expense, maintenance capital expenditures, and other non-cash adjustments. Further adjustments are made to distributable cash flow for certain transaction-related and non-recurring expenses that are included in net income. 
     We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because: 
             
    Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance measure under our revolving credit facility; 
                
    securities analysts and other interested parties use such metrics as measures of financial performance, ability to make distributions to our unitholders and debt service capabilities; 
                
    our management uses them for internal planning purposes, including aspects of our consolidated operating budget, and capital expenditures; and

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income (loss) as measures of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: 
             
    they do not reflect our total cash expenditures, or future requirements for, capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
                
    they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital; 
                
    they do not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our revolving credit facility or term loan; 
                
    although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and 
                
    because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
     The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):

Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  The following discussion of results compares the operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Revenue.   Total revenue for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $  4.1 billion  , a decrease of $  769.5 million   from the   third   quarter of   2015  . This decrease is primarily attributable to the following: 
             
    a decrease in wholesale motor fuel revenue of $  613.3 million   due to a 26.5%, or a $0.54, decrease in the sales price per wholesale motor fuel gallon, slightly offset by an increase in wholesale motor fuel gallons sold of approximately 62.4 million; 
                
    a decrease in retail motor fuel revenue of $  179.0 million   due to a 12.9%, or $0.32, decrease in sales price per retail motor fuel gallon, slightly offset by an increase in gallons sold of approximately 11.6 million; offset by 
                
    an increase in merchandise revenue of $  16.0 million   at our company operated convenience stores due to an increase in the number of retail sites. 
     Gross Profit  . Gross profit for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $  577.4 million  , an increase of $  52.6 million   from the   third   quarter of   2015  . This increase is primarily attributable to the following: 
             
    an increase in the gross profit on wholesale motor fuel of $  62.0 million   due to a 31.8%, or a $0.65, decrease  in the cost per wholesale motor fuel gallon; 
                
    an increase in the merchandise gross profit of $  7.2 million   due to the increase in the number of retail sites mentioned above. The related growth impact is $5.0 million, while the organic margin improvement is $2.2 million; offset by 
                
    a decrease in the gross profit on retail motor fuel of $  17.0 million   due to the 12.9%, or $0.32, decrease in the sales price per gallon mentioned above. 
     Total Operating Expenses  . Total operating expenses for the   third   quarter of   2016   were $  473.2 million  , an increase of $  41.8 million   from the   third   quarter of   2015  . This increase is primarily attributable to the following: 
             
    an increase of general and administrative expenses of $  21.3 million   primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and recruiting cost of $7.2 million, relocation expenses of $6.0 million, and termination expenses of $7.7 million. These increases are primarily due to the transition of employees from Houston, Texas, Corpus Christi, Texas and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Dallas, Texas. 
                
    an increase in other operating expenses of $  9.7 million   primarily attributable to our retail business which has expanded through third-party acquisitions as well as through the construction of new-to-industry sites, resulting in a $1.8 million increase in personnel expense as well as a collective increase of $7.9 million of maintenance expenses, property taxes and licenses   permits; and 
                
    increased depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $  11.6 million   due to third-party acquisitions completed in the last six months of 2015. 
     Interest Expense  . Interest expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $  54.3 million  , an increase of $  25.8 million   from the   third   quarter of   2015  .  This increase is primarily attributable to borrowings under our term loan agreement ("Term Loan"), the issuance of our 2020 and 2021 Senior Notes, as well as the increase in borrowings under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring September 25, 2019 (as amended, the "2014 Revolver"). 
  Income Tax Expense.   Income tax expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $  5.3 million  , a decrease of $  24.8 million   from the   third   quarter of   2015  . This decrease is primarily attributable to lower earnings from the Partnership's consolidated corporate subsidiaries.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information concerning key measures we rely on to gauge our operating performance (in thousands, except gross profit per gallon): 

_______________________________ 
           (1)  
    Excludes the impact of inventory fair value adjustments consistent with the definition of Adjusted EBITDA. 
              (2)  
    We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA to include adjustments for non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposal of assets, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and inventory fair value adjustments. We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense including the accrual of interest expense related to our 2020 and 2023 Senior Notes that is paid on a semi-annual basis, current income tax expense, maintenance capital expenditures, and other non-cash adjustments. Further adjustments are made to distributable cash flow for certain transaction-related and non-recurring expenses that are included in net income 
     We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because: 
             
    Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance measure under our revolving credit facility; 
                
    securities analysts and other interested parties use such metrics as measures of financial performance, ability to make distributions to our unitholders and debt service capabilities; 
                
    our management uses them for internal planning purposes, including aspects of our consolidated operating budget, and capital expenditures; and 
                
    distributable cash flow provides useful information to investors as it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare partnership performance, and as it provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets and the cash our business is generating. 

31 

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income (loss) as measures of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: 
             
    they do not reflect our total cash expenditures, or future requirements for, capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
                
    they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital; 
                
    they do not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our revolving credit facility or term loan; 
                
    although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and 
                
    because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
       
  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  The following discussion of results compares the operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  Revenue.   Total revenue for the first   nine   months of   2016   was $  11.4 billion  , a decrease of $  3.0 billion   from the first   nine   months of   2015  . This change is primarily attributable to the following: 
             
    a decrease in wholesale motor fuel revenue of $  2.4 billion   due to a 30.0%, or a $0.61, decrease in the sales price per wholesale motor fuel gallon, slightly offset by an increase in wholesale motor fuel gallons sold of approximately 16.3 million; 
                
    a decrease in retail motor fuel revenue of $  721.2 million   due to a 16.7%, or $0.41, decrease in sales price per retail motor fuel gallon, offset by an increase in gallons sold of approximately 22.5 million; offset by 
                
    an increase in merchandise revenue of $  72.9 million   at our company operated convenience stores due to an increase in the number of retail sites. 
     Gross Profit  . Gross profit for the first   nine   months of   2016   was $  1.7 billion  , an increase of $  137.5 million   from the first   nine   months of   2015  . This increase is primarily attributable to the following: 
             
    an increase in the gross profit on wholesale motor fuel of $  122.2 million   due to a 34.0%, or $0.66, decrease in the cost per wholesale motor fuel gallon; and 
                
    an increase in merchandise gross profit of $  35.8 million   due to the increase in the number of retail sites mentioned above. The related growth impact is $22.8 million, while the organic margin improvement is $13.1 million;  
                
    an increase in the rental and other gross profit of $  14.8 million   due to increased other retail income such as car wash, ATM, and lottery income; offset by 
                
    a decrease in the gross profit on retail motor fuel of $  35.3 million   due to the 16.7%, or $0.41, decrease in the sales price per retail motor fuel gallon mentioned above. 
     Total Operating Expenses.   Total operating expenses for the first   nine   months of   2016   were $  1.3 billion  , an increase of $  99.7 million   from the first   nine   months of   2015  . This increase is primarily attributable to the following: 
             
    an increase in general and administrative costs of $  34.0 million   primarily due to $15.3 million for the transition of employees from Houston, Texas, Corpus Christi, Texas and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Dallas, Texas, with the remaining increase due to higher professional fees and other administrative expenses, which includes salaries, wages and recruiting cost and telecommunication; 
                
    an increase in other operating expenses of $  32.5 million   primarily attributable to our retail business which has expanded through third-party acquisitions as well as through the construction of new-to-industry sites, resulting in a  $25.9 million increase in personnel expense and a $14.2 million collective increase of maintenance, property tax and licenses   permits; partially offset by lower dealer incentive programs of $7.7 million and; 
                
    an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of  $  31.5 million   due to third-party acquisitions completed in the last six months of 2015. 
     Interest Expense  . Interest expense for the first   nine   months of   2016   was $  132.6 million  , an increase of $  74.9 million   from the first   nine   months of   2015  . This increase is attributable to borrowings under our Term Loan, the issuance of our 2020, 2023 and 2021 Senior Notes, as well as the increase in borrowings under our 2014 Revolver. 
  Income Tax Expense.   Income tax expense for the first   nine   months of   2016   was $  8.9 million  , a decrease of $  38.2 million   from the first   nine   months of   2015  . This decrease is primarily attributable to lower earnings from the Partnership's consolidated corporate subsidiaries. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Liquidity 
  Our principal liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, to fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions from time to time, to service our debt and to make distributions. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of additional long-term debt or partnership units as appropriate given market conditions. We expect that these sources of funds will be adequate to provide for our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 
  
   33 

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and other capital requirements, including capital expenditures and acquisitions, will depend on our future operating performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, we will from time to time consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance our indebtedness. Changes in our operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions. In addition, any of the items discussed in detail under  Item 1A. Risk Factors  included herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   may also significantly impact our liquidity. 
  We had $  80.6 million   and $  72.6 million   of cash and cash equivalents on hand as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, all of which were unrestricted. As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance under the 2014 Revolver was $  958.2 million  , and $  23.6 million   in standby letters of credit were outstanding. The unused availability on the 2014 Revolver at   September 30, 2016   was $  518.2 million  . The Partnership was in compliance with all financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Cash Flows 

Cash Flows Provided by Operations.   Cash flows provided by operations are our main source of liquidity. Our daily working capital requirements fluctuate within each month, primarily in response to the timing of payments for motor fuel, motor fuel tax and rent. Net cash provided by operations was $  340.6 million   and $  349.6 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cash flows fluctuate with increases or decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable which are impacted by increasing or decreasing motor fuel prices and costs, as well as organic growth in volumes sold and volume increases due to acquisitions. 
  Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities.   Net cash used in investing activities was $  2.8 billion   and $  2.2 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, of which $2.5 billion and $1.8 billion in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, was due to acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $  290.6 million   and $  342.4 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. Included in our capital expenditures for the first   nine   months of   2016   was $73.3 million in maintenance capital and $217.3 million in growth capital. Growth capital relates primarily to new store construction. 
  Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities.   Net cash provided by financing activities was $  2.5 billion   and $  1.7 billion    for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we: 
                
    paid $285.9 million in distributions to our unitholders, of which $163.2 million was paid to ETP and ETE collectively; and 
                
    paid $50.0 million in distributions to ETP. 
     We intend to pay a cash distribution to the holders of our common units and Class C units representing limited partners interest in the Partnership ( Class C Units ) on a quarterly basis, to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to our General Partner and its affiliates. Class C unitholders receive distributions at a fixed rate equal to $0.8682 per quarter for each Class C Unit outstanding. There is no guarantee that we will pay a distribution on our units. 
  
   34 

Capital Expenditures 
  We expect capital spending for the full year   2016  , excluding acquisitions, to be within the following ranges (in millions): 

The above growth capital spending estimate includes at least 35 new-to-industry stores that are planned to be built in 2016. 
   
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  Contractual Obligations  . We have contractual obligations which are required to be settled in cash. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   $958.2 million   borrowed on the 2014 Revolver compared to   $450.0 million   borrowed at   December 31, 2015  . The 2014 Revolver matures in September 2019. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $2.2 billion outstanding under our Senior Notes, and $  1.2 billion   outstanding under our Term Loan. See Note 9 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our debt transactions. 
  We enter into derivatives, such as futures and options, to manage our fuel price risk on inventory in the distribution system. Fuel hedging positions are not significant to our operations. We had   1,378   positions, representing   57.9 million   gallons, outstanding at   September 30, 2016   with a negative fair value of   $8.8 million  . 
  Properties  . Most of our leases are net leases requiring us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. We believe that no individual site is material to us. The following table summarizes the number of owned and leased properties as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and on our Form 8-K filed on July 15, 2016. 

35 

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We had outstanding borrowings on the 2014 Revolver of    $958.2 million   and   $1.2 billion   under our Term Loan as of   September 30, 2016  . The annualized effect of a one percentage point change in floating interest rates on our variable rate debt obligations outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , would be to change interest expense by approximately   $22.0 million  . Our primary exposure relates to: 
             
    interest rate risk on short-term borrowings; and 
                
    the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future acquisitions. 
       
  While we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt, management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate debt. We had no interest rate swaps in effect during the first   nine   months of   2016   or   2015  . 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  Aloha has terminals on all four major Hawaiian Islands that hold purchased fuel until it is delivered to customers (typically over a two to three week period). Commodity price risks relating to this inventory are not currently hedged. The terminal inventory balance was $  15.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Sunoco LLC and Susser Petroleum Operating Company LLC ( SPOC ) hold working inventories of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, gasoline blendstocks and transmix in storage. As of   September 30, 2016  , Sunoco LLC and SPOC held approximately $  275.0 million    of such inventory. While in storage, volatility and declines in the market price of stored motor fuel could adversely impact the price at which we can later sell the motor fuel. However, Sunoco LLC and SPOC use futures, forwards and other derivative instruments to hedge a variety of price risks relating to deviations in that inventory from a target base operating level established by management. Derivative instruments utilized consist primarily of exchange-traded futures contracts traded on the NYMEX, CME and ICE as well as over-the-counter transactions (including swap agreements) entered into with established financial institutions and other credit-approved energy companies. Sunoco LLC s and SPOC s policy is generally to purchase only products for which there is a market and to structure sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect profit. Sunoco LLC also engages in controlled trading in accordance with specific parameters set forth in a written risk management policy. For the   2015   fiscal year, Sunoco LLC maintained an average eleven day working inventory. While these derivative instruments represent economic hedges, they are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 
  On a consolidated basis, the Partnership had   1,378   positions, representing   57.9 million   gallons with a negative fair value of $  8.8 million   outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   36 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  As required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), our senior management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level for which they were designed in that the information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  As of March 31, 2016 (effective January 1, 2016), we completed the acquisition of Sunoco Retail. In recording this acquisition, we followed our normal accounting procedures and internal controls. We started integrating Sunoco Retail into our existing internal control procedures from the date of the acquisition and we do not anticipate the integration of Sunoco Retail to result in changes that would materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
  Excluding the acquisition of Sunoco Retail, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13(a) 15(f) or Rule 15d 15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  From time to time, we make changes to our internal control over financial reporting that are intended to enhance its effectiveness and which do not have a material effect on our overall internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and will take action as appropriate.

           1. 
    Operations and Organization: 
     ETP Retail Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (the  Company ) is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ETP formed in May 2014.  In June 2014, the equity interests in multiple entities were contributed to the Company, including (a) 100% of the membership interests in Sunoco LLC, (b) a 99% membership interest in ETC M-A Acquisition, which owned 100% of the membership interests in MACS and (c) a non-controlling membership interest in PES comprising 33% of PES  outstanding common units (collectively, the  Contributed Businesses ). 
  Sunoco LLC was formed by Sunoco in June 2014, at which time Sunoco contributed certain retail assets (the  Contributed Assets ) of its subsidiaries to Sunoco LLC.  Pursuant to the contribution agreement, Sunoco contributed substantially all of its wholesale motor fuel distribution business which included: 
     dealer, distributor and fuel supply agreements, 
     fuel supply agreements to distribute motor fuel to Sunoco convenience stores and other retail fuel outlets, 
     real property owned in fee, 
     leases and subleases under which it was a tenant, and  
     leases and subleases under which it was a landlord. 
  All of the Contributed Assets were recorded at book value as this transaction was considered to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As discussed above, Sunoco contributed its interest in Sunoco LLC to the Company in June 2014.  Sunoco was acquired by ETP in October 2012. 
  In October 2014, Sunoco LP, a publicly traded master limited partnership, acquired MACS from ETC M-A Acquisition in a transaction valued at $768 million (the  MACS Transaction ). The transaction included company-operated retail convenience stores and dealer-operated and consignment sites, which had originally been acquired by ETC M-A Acquisition in October 2013. The consideration paid by Sunoco LP consisted of 3,983,540 Sunoco LP common units and $556 million in cash. 
  In April 2015, Sunoco LP acquired a 31.58% equity interest and 50.1% voting interest in Sunoco LLC from the Company for $816 million (the  Sunoco LLC Transaction ).  Sunoco LP paid $775 million in cash and issued 795,482 Sunoco LP common units to the Company.  As a result of the Sunoco LLC Transaction, the Company no longer has a controlling interest in Sunoco LLC, therefore all of the Sunoco LLC operations were deconsolidated as of April 1, 2015.  
  Effective January 1, 2016, ETP contributed 100% of the equity interests in Sunoco Retail to the Company. Sunoco Retail s assets included (i) the retail assets and the ethanol plant located in Fulton, NY formerly owned by Sunoco R M, (ii) the retail assets formerly owned by Atlantic Refining and Marketing Corp; and (iii) 100% of the membership interests in Sunmarks LLC. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company contributed to Sunoco LP the remaining 68.42% membership interest  and 49.9% voting interest in Sunoco LLC and 100% of the membership interest in Sunoco Retail for $2.2 billion in cash (including working capital) and the issuance to the Company of 5,710,922 Sunoco LP common units (the  Sunoco Retail Transaction ). Concurrently with the execution of the transaction, the Company distributed the $2.2 billion in cash to  Sunoco R M and Atlantic Refining   Marketing Corp in the amount of $2 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively (the  R M and Atlantic Distribution ). In exchange for the R M and Atlantic Distribution, Sunoco R M and Atlantic Refining   Marketing Corp agreed to provide support to the Company related to the Company s guarantee of the Term Loan Facility. 
  Through its membership interest in Sunoco LLC, the Company was primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of motor fuels to Sunoco R M and third parties in the United States.  Sunoco R M operated convenience stores and retail fuel outlets under the proprietary Sunoco brand, primarily in the east coast and southeast regions of the United States.  Through its membership interest in Sunoco LLC, the Company also distributed motor fuel to Sunoco-branded retail fuel outlets operated by third parties under long-term contracts and supplied other commercial customers on a spot or short-term contract basis. 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries owned the following: 
               
    a non-controlling membership interest in PES comprising 33% of PES  outstanding common units.

2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 
     Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
  The unaudited financial information included in this Form 10-Q has been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with GAAP. In the opinion of the Company s management, such financial information reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for such interim periods in accordance with GAAP.  All intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
  Sunoco allocated various corporate overhead expenses to the Contributed Assets based on percentage of property, plant and equipment, cost of goods sold, margin and headcount.  These allocations are not necessarily indicative of the cost that the Contributed Assets would have incurred by operating as an independent stand-alone entity.  As such, the consolidated financial statements may not fully reflect what the Contributed Assets  financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had the Contributed Assets operated as a stand-alone company during the periods presented. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ), which changed the requirements for consolidations analysis. Under ASU 2015-02, reporting entities are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2016, and the adoption did not impact the Companys s financial position or results of operations. 
  Cash 
  The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates 
  The Company owns interests in Sunoco LP and PES that are accounted for by the equity method for which the Company exercises significant influence over, but does not control, the investee s operating and financial policies. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  During the periods presented, the Company derived revenue from the sale of fuel.  Revenue was recognized at the time of sale or when fuel was delivered to the customer. 
  Refined product exchange transactions, which are entered into primarily to acquire refined products of a desired quantity or at a desired location, are netted in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Motor Fuel Taxes 
  Consumer excise taxes on sales of refined products are excluded from both revenues and costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, with no effect on net income. 
  Income Taxes 
  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method as if the Company were a separate taxpayer during the period that its operations were included as part of a federal consolidated tax return filing group with its parent company.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Company are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. 
  
   The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.  The determination of the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. Then, the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and record any changes through the provision for income taxes. 
  Under the separate entity method, the Company is assumed to file a separate return with the taxing authority, thereby reporting its taxable income or loss and paying the applicable tax to or receiving the appropriate refund from its parent.  However, since there is no tax-sharing agreement in place between the Company and its parent, any taxes payable or receivable on current taxable income or loss at the end of each reporting date is treated as a capital contribution or dividend. 
  The Company s investment in PES is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes.  Since income taxes are not provided for partnerships, no income taxes are reflected in the financial statements for those operations. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The carrying amounts recorded for advances to affiliated companies and accrued and other current liabilities in the consolidated financial statements approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of the instruments. 
  3.      Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates: 
  PES 
  The Company s investment in PES consists of a non-controlling membership interest in PES comprising 33% of PES  outstanding common units.  PES is a joint venture with The Carlyle Group, L.P. ( The Carlyle Group ), which owns two crude oil refining facilities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and an adjacent crude oil rail unloading terminal. 
  Sunoco LP 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company s investment in Sunoco LP  consists of 10,489,944 Sunoco LP common units, representing approximately 11% of the total outstanding Sunoco LP common units at September 30, 2016.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  Introduction 
  ETP Retail Holdings, LLC (the  Company ) is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ETP formed in May 2014.  In June 2014, the equity interests in multiple entities were contributed to the Company, including (a) 100% of the membership interests in Sunoco LLC, (b) a 99% membership interest in ETC M-A Acquisition, which owned 100% of the membership interests in MACS and (c) a non-controlling membership interest in PES comprising 33% of PES  outstanding common units. 
  In October 2014, Sunoco LP, a publicly traded master limited partnership, acquired MACS from ETC M-A Acquisition. The transaction included company-operated retail convenience stores and dealer-operated and consignment sites, which had originally been acquired by ETC M-A Acquisition in October 2013. 
  In April 2015, Sunoco acquired a 31.58% equity interest and a 50.1% voting interest in Sunoco LLC from the Company.  As a result of the transaction, the Company no longer has a controlling interest in Sunoco LLC; therefore, all of the Sunoco LLC operations were deconsolidated as of April 1, 2015. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, ETP contributed 100% of the equity interests in Sunoco Retail to the Company.  Immediately prior to this contribution, Sunoco Retail s assets included (i) the retail assets and the ethanol plant located in Fulton, NY formerly owned by Sunoco R M, (ii) the retail assets formerly owned by Atlantic Refining; and (iii) 100% of the membership interests in Sunmarks LLC. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company contributed to Sunoco LP the remaining 68.42% membership interest in Sunoco LLC and 100% of the membership interest in  Sunoco Retail (described below).  Prior to this transaction, the Company, through its interest in Sunoco LLC, was primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of motor fuels to Sunoco R M and third parties in the United States.  Sunoco R M operated convenience stores and retail fuel outlets under the proprietary Sunoco brand, primarily in the east coast and southeast regions of the United States. Through its membership interest in Sunoco LLC, the Company also distributed motor fuel to Sunoco-branded retail fuel outlets operated by third parties under long-term contracts.  Through its membership interest in Sunoco LLC, the Company also supplied other commercial customers on a spot or short-term contract basis. 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company owned the following:
