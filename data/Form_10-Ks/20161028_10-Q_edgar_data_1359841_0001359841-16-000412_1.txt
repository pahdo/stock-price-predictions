(1) 
    Basis of Presentation 
     These statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and, in accordance with those rules and regulations, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Management believes that the disclosures made are adequate for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of Hanesbrands Inc., a Maryland corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (the  Company  or  Hanesbrands ). In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the interim periods presented herein. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Three subsidiaries of the Company close on the calendar month-end, which is less than a week earlier than the Company s consolidated quarter end. The difference in reporting of financial information for these subsidiaries did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Certain prior year amounts in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, none of which are material, have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the Company s results of operations. 
  These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The year end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year. 
   
           (2) 
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
     Consolidation 
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810) , an update to their existing consolidation model, which changes the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The new rules were effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have an impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Debt Issuance Costs 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest , which require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. The new rules were effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Cloud Computing  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement . The guidance provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a software license is included, the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting for other software licenses. If a software license is not included, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The new rules were effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Fair Value Measurement  
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,  Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) , which removes the requirement to  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  
  HANESBRANDS INC. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   (Continued) 
  (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data) 
  (unaudited) 

categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and requires separate disclosure of those investments instead. These disclosures were effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Measurement Period Adjustments 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805) , which simplify the accounting for measurement period adjustments by eliminating the requirements to restate prior period financial statements for these adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new standard, which should be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that occur after the effective date, was effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Stock Compensation 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in income as they occur.  The new guidance also changes the cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits, classifying them as operating inflows or outflows.  The new rules are effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. The Company elected to early adopt in the second quarter of 2016, with a retrospective effective date of January 3, 2016. Periods prior to 2016 were not restated for the adoption of this accounting standard as the Company has adopted this standard on a prospective basis beginning January 3, 2016. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Inventory 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , which require inventory to be recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay effective dates for the new accounting rules related to revenue recognition for contracts with customers by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Principal versus Agent Considerations) , which clarifies revenue recognition when an agent, along with the entity, is involved in providing a good or service to a customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing) , which clarifies the principle for determining whether a good or service is  separately identifiable  and, therefore, should be accounted for separately. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients) , which clarifies the objective of the collectability criterion. A separate update issued in May 2016 clarifies the accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs as well as accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 with retrospective application required. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the new rules on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.   
  Hedge Accounting 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships , which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative contract, in and of itself, does not require the dedesignation of a hedging relationship.  The new standard, which can be adopted prospectively or on a modified retrospective basis, is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments , which clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call

(put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this Update is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. The new standard, which should be applied on a modified prospective basis, is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Lease Accounting 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which will require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases that are not short-term in nature. The new rules will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the new rules on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
  Statement of Cash Flows 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . Issues addressed in the new guidance that are relevant to the Company include debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The new rules will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company s cash flows.

    Acquisitions 
     Pacific Brands 
  On July 14, 2016, the Company acquired   100%   of the outstanding shares of Pacific Brands Limited ( Pacific Brands ) for a total purchase price of AUD$  1,049,360   (  $800,871  ). US dollar equivalents are based on acquisition date exchange rates. The Company funded the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand, a portion of the net proceeds from the   3.5%   Senior Notes issued in June 2016 and borrowings under the Australian Term A-1 Loan Facility and the Australian Term A-2 Loan Facility.  
  Pacific Brands contributed net revenues from continuing operations of   $111,292   and pretax earnings of   $6,993   (excluding acquisition and integration related charges included in general corporate expenses of approximately   $19,575  ) since the date of acquisition.

The Company believes the acquisition will create growth opportunities by adding to the Company s portfolio of leading innerwear brands supported by the Company s global low-cost supply chain and manufacturing network. Factors that contribute to the amount of goodwill recognized for the acquisition include the value of the existing work force and expected cost savings by utilizing the Company s low-cost supply chain and expected synergies with existing Company functions. Goodwill associated with the acquisition is not tax deductible. 
  The   Bonds, Sheridan, Explorer, Razza, Hestia   and   Voodoo   trademarks and brand names, which management believes to have indefinite lives, have been valued at   $410,602  .

The allocation of purchase price is preliminary and subject to change. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized are related to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, income taxes and residual goodwill. Accordingly, adjustments may be made to the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances, which existed at the acquisition date. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition (July 14, 2016) include the following: 

Champion Europe  
  On June 30, 2016, the Company acquired   100%   of Champion Europe S.p.A. ( Champion Europe ), which owns the trademark for the   Champion   brand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from certain individual shareholders in an all-cash transaction valued at    220,293   (  $245,069  ) enterprise value less working capital adjustments as defined in the purchase agreement, which includes    40,700   (  $45,277  ) in estimated contingent consideration. US dollar equivalents are based on acquisition date exchange rates. The contingent consideration is included in the  Accrued liabilities  line in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and is based on   10   times Champion Europe s expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) for the calendar year 2016 and is payable in 2017. The Company funded the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the   3.5%   Senior Notes issued in June 2016.  
  Champion Europe contributed net revenues of   $62,127   and pretax earnings of   $8,423   (excluding acquisition and integration related charges included in general corporate expenses of approximately   $7,550  ) since the date of acquisition. The results of Champion Europe have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and are reported as part of the International segment. 
  The Company believes combining the   Champion   business will create a unified platform to benefit from the global consumer growth trend for active apparel. Factors that contribute to the amount of goodwill recognized for the acquisition include the value of the existing work force and expected cost savings by utilizing the Company s low-cost supply chain and expected synergies with existing Company functions. Goodwill associated with the acquisition is not tax deductible. 
  The   Champion   trademark, which management believes to have an indefinite life, has been valued at   $119,146  . Amortizable intangible assets have been assigned values of   $15,463   for distributor relationships,   $2,225   for license agreements and   $1,557   for unfavorable leases.

    Discontinued Operations 
     As part of the Company s acquisition of Pacific Brands, the Company acquired Pacific Brands legacy Tontine Pillow business and Dunlop Flooring business. The Company has concluded that these businesses are not a strategic fit; therefore, the Company has decided not to retain them, and is marketing the businesses to prospective buyers. These two businesses have been classified as assets held for sale and qualify for discontinued operation upon the acquisition date. The Company expects to complete the sale of these businesses within one year of the Pacific Brands acquisition date. Therefore, the operating results and related assets and liabilities have been classified as discontinued operations in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Discontinued operations does not include any allocation of corporate overhead expense or interest expense.

    Stockholders  Equity 
     Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) was computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS was calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock using the treasury stock method. 
  The reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares outstanding is as follows: 

For the   quarter and nine months ended     October 1, 2016  ,   42   restricted stock units were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, and for the   quarter and nine months ended     October 3, 2015  , no restricted stock units were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

Senior Notes Refinancing 
  During the quarter ended July 2, 2016, the Company refinanced its debt structure to reduce interest rates, increase borrowing capacity, shift to more fixed rate debt and to help fund the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. The refinancing consisted of: (i) issuing   $900,000   aggregate principal amount of the   4.875%   Senior Notes due 2026,   $900,000   aggregate principal amount of the   4.625%   Senior Notes due 2024, and    500,000   aggregate principal amount of the   3.5%   Senior Notes due 2024; (ii) redeeming in full the Company s   6.375%   Senior Notes due 2020; and (iii) repaying a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Loan Facility. 
  The refinancing activity resulted in incurrence of   $40,049   in capitalized debt issuance costs for the new Senior Notes. Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the debt instruments, which range from   eight   to   10 years  .  
  The Company recognizes charges in the  Other expenses  line of the Consolidated Statements of Income for fees incurred in financing transactions such as refinancing and amendments and for write-offs incurred in the early extinguishment of debt. In the second quarter of 2016 the Company recognized charges of   $47,291   for the call premium and write-off of unamortized debt costs related to the redemption of the   6.375%   Senior Notes. 
  4.875% Senior Notes and 4.625% Senior Notes 
  On May 6, 2016, the Company issued   $900,000   aggregate principal amount of   4.875%   Senior Notes and   $900,000   aggregate principal amount of   4.625%   Senior Notes (collectively, the  USD Senior Notes ), with interest payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year.  The   4.875%   Senior Notes will mature on May 15, 2026 and the   4.625%   Senior Notes will mature on May 15, 2024, respectively.  The sale of the USD Senior Notes resulted in collective net proceeds from the sale of approximately   $1,773,000  , which were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the   6.375%   Senior Notes and reduce the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility.

The indenture governing the USD Senior Notes limits the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur liens, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets. The indenture also contains customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of other agreements in such indenture; failure to pay certain other indebtedness; failure to pay certain final judgments; failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. 
  The USD Senior Notes were issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act and do not require disclosure of separate financial information for the guarantor subsidiaries. 
  3.5% Senior Notes 
  On June 3, 2016, the Company issued    500,000   aggregate principal amount of   3.5%   Senior Notes, with interest payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year.  The Notes will mature on June 15, 2024.  The sale of the notes resulted in net proceeds of approximately    492,500  , which were used to help fund the acquisition of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands. 
  On or after March 15, 2024, the Company may redeem all or a portion of the   3.5%   Senior Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. 
  The   3.5%   Senior Notes are the senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, subject to certain exceptions, by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s existing Euro Term Loan facility under the Company s Senior Secured Credit Facility. The indenture governing the   3.5%   Senior Notes limits the ability of the Company and each of the guarantors of the Notes (including the Company) to incur certain liens, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets. The indenture also contains customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of other agreements in the indenture; failure to pay certain other indebtedness; certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; failure to pay certain final judgments; and failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable. 
  The   3.5%   Senior Notes were issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act and do not require disclosure of separate financial information for the guarantor subsidiaries. 
  Australia Term A-1, Australia Term A-2, and Australian Revolver 
  On July 4, 2016, the Company established a floating rate AUD$  200,000   Australian Term A-1 Loan Facility (the  Australian Term A-1 ) with interest payable every three or six months. At   October 1, 2016  , the effective interest rate on the Australian Term A-1 was   3.52%  . The Australian Term A-1 matures on July 11, 2019. In addition, on July 11, 2016 the Company established a floating rate AUD$  200,000   Australian Term A-2 Loan Facility (the  Australian Term A-2 ) with interest payable every three or six months. At   October 1, 2016  , the effective interest rate on the Australian Term A-2 was   3.82%  . The Australian Term A-2 matures on July 11, 2021. On July 15, 2016 the Company established the Australian Revolving Facility (the  Australian Revolver ) in the amount of AUD$  65,000   with interest payable at a variable rate.  The Australian Revolver will mature on July 15, 2021. The Australian Term A-1, Australian Term A-2 and Australian Revolver interest rates are based on the Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate ( BBSY ) plus an applicable margin which is driven by the Company s debt rating. 
  The Australia Term A-1 and the Australian Term A-2 were issued to help fund the Pacific Brands acquisition while the Revolver will be utilized for future working capital requirements.  The Australian Term A-1, Australian Term A-2, and Australian Revolver were established under the Company s Syndicated Facility, a joinder to the Company s Senior Secured Credit Facility.

The Syndicated Facility Agreement requires the Company to prepay any outstanding Term Loans in connection with (i) the incurrence of certain indebtedness and (ii) non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds in any period of twelve-consecutive months, with customary reinvestment provisions.  The Syndicated Facility Agreement also requires the Company, and certain of its subsidiary guarantors, as applicable, to prepay any outstanding Term Loans in connection with excess cash flow, which amount will be based upon the Company s leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. All such prepayments will be made on a pro rata basis under each of the applicable Term Loan Facilities that are subject to such prepayments.  
  Under the terms of the Syndicated Facility Agreement, the Company must maintain at least a   4  :1 total debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, provided that, following an acquisition of over   $200,000  , the maximum leverage multiple shall be increased to   4.5  :1 for each quarter in the following 12-month period, and a minimum   3  :1 EBITDA to interest expense ratio. 
  European Revolving Loan Facility 
  On September 9, 2016, the Company established a    100,000   European Revolving Loan Facility.  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had an outstanding balance of   $67,302   under the European Revolving Loan Facility. Proceeds from the European Revolving Loan Facility were used to refinance existing debt for Hanes Europe Innerwear and will be used for future working capital requirements. The maturity date of the European Revolving Loan Facility is September 9, 2017. 
  The Company may from time to time voluntarily prepay the European Revolving Loan Facility in whole or in part without a premium or penalty provided that among other items, principal payments be made in amounts of    5,000   or in whole multiple of    1,000   in excess thereof.  Any prepayment of principal shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid. 
  Interest under the European Revolving Credit Facility is calculated using LIBOR for Euro with a   zero   floor plus a 150 basis point margin.  Interest is based on the outstanding principal amount for each interest period from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such interest period plus the applicable rate.  
  Other Debt Related Activity 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company had   $907,854   of borrowing availability under the   $1,000,000   Revolving Loan Facility after taking into account outstanding borrowings and   $92,146   of standby and trade letters of credit issued and outstanding under this facility. 
  In March 2016, the Company amended the accounts receivable securitization facility that it entered into in November 2007 (the  Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility ). This amendment primarily extended the termination date to   March 2017   and changed the borrowing capacity from a fixed capacity to a varying limit throughout the year, in order to minimize fees for the Company s unused portion of the facility. 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under its credit facilities.

    Financial Instruments and Risk Management 
     The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to movements in foreign exchange rates. As of   October 1, 2016  , the notional U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell and purchase foreign currencies within the Company s derivative portfolio was   $627,139   and   $191  , respectively, primarily consisting of contracts hedging exposures to the Australian dollar, Euro, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, South African rand, Japanese yen and Brazilian real. 
  Fair Values of Derivative Instruments 
  The fair values of derivative financial instruments recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company were as follows: 

Cash Flow Hedges 
  The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short-term foreign currency-denominated transactions, foreign currency-denominated investments and other known foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset losses and gains on the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 
  The Company expects to reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months a net loss from AOCI of approximately   $3,821  . 
  The changes in fair value of derivatives excluded from the Company s effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported in the  Selling, general and administrative expenses  line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

The effect of cash flow hedge derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI is as follows:  

Derivative Contracts Not Designated As Hedges 
  The Company uses foreign exchange derivative contracts as economic hedges against the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on existing accounts receivable and payable balances and intercompany lending transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards and are recorded at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized directly into earnings. Gains or losses on these contracts largely offset the net remeasurement gains or losses on the related assets and liabilities. 
  The effect of derivative contracts not designated as hedges on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income is as follows: 

(10) 
    Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
     As of   October 1, 2016  , the Company held certain financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These consisted of the Company s derivative instruments related to foreign exchange rates, deferred compensation plan liabilities and contingent consideration resulting from the Champion Europe acquisition. The fair values of foreign currency derivatives are determined using the cash flows of the foreign exchange contract, discount rates to account for the passage of time and current foreign exchange market data and are categorized as Level 2. The fair value of deferred compensation plans is based on readily available current market data and is categorized as Level 2. The fair value of the contingent consideration obligation is determined by applying an option pricing model using Champion Europe s expected EBITDA for calendar year 2016, as further described in Note 3 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, and is categorized as Level 3. The contingent consideration obligation will be revalued each reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved, with any adjustments to the fair value recognized in earnings. The Company s defined benefit pension plan investments are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
  There were no changes during the quarter ended   October 1, 2016   to the Company s valuation techniques used to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis. There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the

quarter ended   October 1, 2016  . As of and during the   quarter and nine months ended     October 1, 2016  , the Company did not have any non-financial assets or liabilities that were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis. 
  The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company s financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  . The carrying amount of trade accounts receivable included allowance for doubtful accounts, chargebacks and other deductions of   $35,831   and   $13,100   as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , respectively. The fair value of debt, which is classified as a Level 2 liability, was   $4,277,195   and   $2,537,640   as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , respectively. Debt had a carrying value of   $4,116,260   and   $2,506,981   as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted new accounting rules, which require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. The carrying value of debt reflected on the face of the balance sheet reflects the adoption of the new accounting rules. However, the carrying value of debt reflected in this footnote disclosure reflects the gross amount owed to creditors. The fair values were estimated using quoted market prices as provided in secondary markets, which consider the Company s credit risk and market related conditions. The carrying amounts of the Company s notes payable, which is classified as a Level 2 liability, approximated fair value as of   October 1, 2016   and   January 2, 2016  , primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
   
   The Company s effective income tax rate for continuing operations was   6%   and   8%   for the quarters ended   October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively. The Company s effective income tax rate for continuing operations was   7%   and   11%   for   the nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015  , respectively.  The lower effective income tax rate for the quarter and   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   compared to the quarter and   nine months ended     October 3, 2015   was primarily due to a lower proportion of earnings attributed to domestic subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates higher than foreign subsidiaries.

    Business Segment Information 
     The Company s operations are managed and reported in   four   operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear, Direct to Consumer and International. These segments are organized principally by product category, geographic location and distribution channel. Each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment s businesses, but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms. As a result of a shift in management responsibilities, the Company decided in the first quarter of 2016 to move its wholesale e-commerce business, which sells products directly to retailers, from its Direct to Consumer segment into the respective Innerwear and Activewear segments. Prior year segment sales and operating profit results have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. 
  The types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are as follows: 
             
    Innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of men s underwear, panties, children s underwear, socks, hosiery and intimate apparel, which includes bras and shapewear. 
                
    Activewear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature under the product categories of branded printwear and retail activewear, as well as licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores, mass retail and other channels. 
                
    Direct to Consumer includes the Company s value-based ( outlet ) stores and retail Internet operations that sell products from the Company s portfolio of leading brands directly to consumers.  
                
    International primarily relates to the Europe, Asia, Latin America, Canada and Australia geographic locations that sell products that span across the Innerwear and Activewear reportable segments.    
     The Company evaluates the operating performance of its segments based upon segment operating profit, which is defined as operating profit before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. The Company decided in the first quarter of 2016 to revise the manner in which the Company allocates certain selling, general and administrative expenses. Certain prior year segment operating profit disclosures have been revised to conform to current year presentation. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  .

  Overview 
  We are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands, including   Hanes  ,   Champion  ,   Maidenform, DIM, Playtex, Bali  ,   JMS  /  Just My Size  ,   Nur Die/Nur Der  ,   L eggs  ,   Lovable, Wonderbra,     Flexees  ,   Lilyette  ,   Gear for Sports  ,   Bonds  ,   Berlei  ,   Shock Absorber  ,   Abanderado  ,   Rinbros   and   Zorba.   We design, manufacture, source and sell a broad range of basic apparel such as T-shirts, bras, panties, men s underwear, children s underwear, activewear, socks and hosiery. 
  Our operations are managed and reported in four operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear, Direct to Consumer and International. These segments are organized principally by product category, geographic location and distribution channel. Each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment s businesses, but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms. As a result of a shift in management responsibilities, we decided in the first quarter of 2016 to move our wholesale e-commerce business, which sells products directly to retailers, from our Direct to Consumer segment to the respective Innerwear and Activewear segments. In addition, we decided in the first quarter of 2016 to revise the manner in which we allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses. Prior year segment sales and operating profit results have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.  
  Highlights from the Quarter Ended   October 1, 2016 
  Key financial highlights are as follows: 
                
    We acquired Pacific Brands Limited ( Pacific Brands ) on July 14, 2016 in an all-cash transaction valued at   $801 million  . Pacific Brands is a leading underwear and intimate apparel company in Australia with a portfolio of strong brands including   Bonds  , Australia s top brand of underwear, babywear and socks, and   Berlei  , a leading sports bra brand and leading seller of premium bras in department stores. The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand, a portion of the proceeds of our new 3.5% Senior Notes issued in June 2016 and borrowings under our Australian Term A-1 Loan Facility and Australian Term A-2 Loan Facility. We believe this acquisition will create growth opportunities by adding to our portfolio of leading innerwear brands supported by our global low-cost supply chain and manufacturing network. 
                
    As part of our acquisition of Pacific Brands, we acquired the Tontine Pillow and the Dunlop Flooring businesses. These businesses are not a strategic fit and therefore, we have decided not to retain them and are marketing the businesses to prospective buyers. The aforementioned businesses are classified as assets held for sale and presented as discontinued operations.

Outlook 
  We expect our 2016 full year net sales to be approximately $6.15 billion to $6.18 billion.  
  Interest expense and other expenses are expected to be approximately $158 million combined. 
  We estimate our full year effective income tax rate to be in the high single-digits. 
  We expect net cash flow from operations to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $90 million.  
  Pretax charges related to debt refinancing and acquisition and integration related charges are expected to be approximately $180 million. The guidance noted herein reflects the expected contributions from our acquisitions of Champion Europe, which closed on June 30, 2016 and Pacific Brands, which closed on July 14, 2016. 
  Seasonality and Other Factors 
  Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. Generally, our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. We generally have higher sales during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather, which benefits certain product categories such as fleece. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers  decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may cancel or change delivery schedules, manage on-hand inventory levels, or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us. Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions. 
  Although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, gasoline prices, weather, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are outside of our control. Consumers  purchases of discretionary items, including our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. These consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lower-priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products, or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time. 
  Changes in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products, such as intimate apparel and men s underwear, and lower margin products, such as activewear, fluctuate from time to time. In addition, sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time to time. Our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us, which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict. However, certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature, as sales of socks, hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters (July to December) of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather, back-to-school shopping and holidays, while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers  preferences and discretionary spending.

Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations     Third Quarter Ended     October 1, 2016   Compared with   Third Quarter Ended     October 3, 2015 

Net Sales 
  Net sales increased 11% during   the third quarter of 2016   primarily due to the following: 
              
    Higher net sales in our Innerwear segment primarily driven by our basics business as we focus on our core product with the introduction of our FreshIQ odor control technology; 
                
    Continued growth in our college bookstore business and   Champion   sales within the mass merchant channel; and  
                
    Higher net sales in our International segment, excluding the aforementioned acquisitions, primarily in the Asian market. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    Decreased sales in the intimates business and continued declines in Hosiery sales; 
                
    Lower net sales in the sporting goods and mid-tier department store channels within our Activewear segment, primarily driven by bankruptcies of certain sporting goods retailers; and 
                
    Lower sales in our Direct to Consumer segment due to slower traffic at our outlet stores and planned exit from our legacy catalog business and non-core product offerings to a more focused branded store and Internet strategy. 
     Gross Profit 
  The increase in gross profit was attributable to higher sales volume primarily from acquisitions, supply chain efficiencies and synergies recognized from the integration of our acquisitions, offset partially by unfavorable product sales mix within the Activewear segment and increased acquisition, integration and other action related costs.  Included in gross profit in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 are charges of approximately $14 million and $8 million, respectively, related to acquisition, integration and other action related costs.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 23.9% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 23.4% in the same period of 2015. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses were charges of $29 million and $35 million of acquisition, integration and other action related costs for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased due to the higher proportion of selling, general and administrative expenses for the recently acquired entities, Pacific Brands and Champion Europe, offset by synergy benefits from the integration of prior acquisitions, planned reduction of our catalog distribution costs and continued cost control.

     Table of Contents  

Other Highlights 
  Interest Expense     higher by $12 million in   the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015   primarily due to higher debt balances to help fund acquisitions, share repurchases in 2016 and normal seasonal working capital build. Our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 3.69% during   the third quarter of 2016   and in the   third   quarter of   2015  . 
  Income Tax Expense     our effective income tax rate was 6% and 8% for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The lower tax rate in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to a lower proportion of earnings attributed to domestic subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates higher than foreign subsidiaries.  
  Discontinued Operations     the results of our discontinued operations include the operations of two businesses, Tontine Pillow and Dunlop Flooring, purchased in the Pacific Brands acquisition.  
   
  Operating Results by Business Segment     Third Quarter Ended     October 1, 2016   Compared with   Third Quarter Ended     October 3, 2015 

Innerwear    

Innerwear net sales increased due to higher net sales in our basics business, particularly in men s underwear and women s panties, as we focus on our core product with the introduction of our FreshIQ odor control technology, offset, in part, with sales declines in our intimate apparel business driven by the anniversary of large, one-time shipments from increased space gains in   Hanes  , general softness in shapewear and continued declines in Hosiery. 
  Increased operating profit was driven largely by higher sales volume with higher margin core products, our focus on inventory controls and lower selling, general and administrative expenses from continued cost control. 
  Activewear    

Activewear net sales decreased due to challenges in the sporting goods and mid-tier department store channels, primarily driven by bankruptcies of certain sporting goods retailers, partially offset by continued growth in our college bookstore business and   Champion   sales in the mass merchant channel. 
  Operating profit decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable product sales mix and decreased sales volume. 
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

Direct to Consumer 

Direct to Consumer segment net sales were lower as a result of slower traffic at our outlet stores and the planned exit of our legacy catalog business and non-core product offerings to a more focused branded store and Internet strategy. Operating profit decreased as a result of lower sales volume, partially offset by decreased catalog distribution costs.  
  International 

Net sales in the International segment were higher as a result of the following:  
             
    The acquisitions of Pacific Brands, Champion Europe and Champion Japan licensee; 
                
    Continued space gains in Asia within our Activewear product category; and  
                
    Favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    Lower sales volume in Hanes Innerwear Europe, with the planned exit of small, low performing brands in Europe and as certain markets in Europe have been impacted by a slowing economy. 
     Operating profit increased primarily due to the acquisitions of Pacific Brands, Champion Europe and Champion Japan, higher sales volume in Asia and cost synergies in our Hanes Europe Innerwear business. 
  Corporate 
  Corporate expenses included certain administrative costs and acquisition, integration and other action related charges totaling $43 million in both   the third quarter of 2016   and 2015. Acquisition and integration costs are expenses related directly to an acquisition and its integration into the organization. These costs include legal fees, consulting fees, bank fees, severance costs, certain purchase accounting items, facility closures, inventory write-offs, infrastructure (including information technology), and similar charges. Acquisition related currency transactions represent the foreign exchange gain from financing activities related to the Champion Europe and Pacific Brands acquisitions. Foundational costs are expenses associated with building infrastructure to support and integrate current and future acquisitions, primarily consisting of information technology spend. Other costs relate to other items not included in the aforementioned categories, primarily consisting of non-cash items related to the exit of the commercial sales organization in the China market in 2015. Maidenform acquisition and integration costs and Foundational costs were completed in 2015.

Net Sales 
  Net sales increased 3% in the   nine   months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 as a result of the following:  
               
    Increased sales in our basics business as we focus on core products with the introduction of our FreshIQ odor control technology; and 
                
    Continued growth in the Activewear segment within our college bookstore business and   Champion   sales within the mass merchant channel. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    Lower sales in the intimates business and continued declines in Hosiery sales; 
                
    Lower net sales in our Activewear segment in the sporting goods and mid-tier department store channels, primarily due to certain sporting goods retailer bankruptcies; 
                
    Lower net sales in our Direct to Consumer segment due to slower traffic at our outlet stores and the planned exit of our legacy catalog business and removal of non-core product offerings to a more focused branded store and Internet strategy; and

Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.  
     Gross Profit 
  Gross profit increased in the   nine   months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to the Pacific Brands and Champion Europe acquisitions in 2016, as well as supply chain efficiencies, reduced acquisition, integration and other action related costs, and synergies recognized from the integration of our acquisitions, partially offset by costs associated with our inventory management related efforts and unfavorable product sales mix within the Activewear segment. Included in gross profit in the   nine   months of 2016 and 2015 are charges of approximately $28 million and $48 million, respectively, related to acquisition, integration and other action related costs.   
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 24.5% for the   nine   months of 2016 compared to 26.8% in the same period of 2015. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses were charges of $64 million and $164 million of acquisition, integration and other action related costs for the   nine   months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The lower selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, resulted from the decrease in acquisition, integration and other action related costs, synergy benefits from the integration of prior acquisitions, planned reduction of our catalog distribution and continued cost control, partially offset by the higher proportion of selling, general and administrative expenses for the recently acquired entities, Pacific Brands and Champion Europe.  
  Other Highlights 
  Other Expense         higher by $49 million in   the nine months of 2016 compared to 2015  , primarily due to costs associated with the redemption of our 6.375% Senior Notes, which included a call premium and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
  Interest Expense     higher by $24 million for the   nine   months of 2016 compared to the   nine   months of 2015 primarily due to higher debt balances to help fund acquisitions, share repurchases, and normal seasonal working capital build, partially offset by a lower average interest rate. Our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 3.65% during the   nine   months of 2016 whereas the similar rate for the   nine   months of 2015 was 3.80%. 
  Income Tax Expense     our effective income tax rate was 7% and 11% for the   nine   months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The lower effective income tax rate for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   October 3, 2015   was primarily due to a lower proportion of earnings attributed to domestic subsidiaries, which are taxed at rates higher than foreign subsidiaries. Income tax expense also benefited from the adoption of new accounting rules related to accounting for stock compensation, which requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in income as they occur. 
  Discontinued Operations     the results of our discontinued operations include the operations of two businesses, Tontine Pillow and Dunlop Flooring, purchased in the Pacific Brands acquisition.

Innerwear 

The lower net sales in our Innerwear segment primarily resulted from a slower than expected retail environment, higher sales in the same period of 2015 due to larger X-Temp pipes from space gains and continued declines in Hosiery sales, offset, in part, by higher sales in the basics business as we focus on core products with the introduction of our FreshIQ odor control technology.   
  Decreased operating profit was driven by sales volume and costs associated with our inventory management related efforts, offset by continued cost control.   
  Activewear    

  Activewear net sales decreased due to the following: 
             
    Hanes Activewear space shifts at a large mass merchant retailer due to an expected loss of certain seasonal programs; 
                
    Lower     sales in the sporting goods and mid-tier department store channels primarily due to certain retailer bankruptcies; and 
                
    Higher   Champion   sales in 2015 from larger     pipes resulting from space gains. 
     Partially offset by: 
              
    Continued growth in our college bookstore business.   
     Operating profit decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable product sales mix and lower sales volume.   
  Direct to Consumer    

  Direct to Consumer segment net sales were lower as a result of slower traffic at our outlet stores and the planned exit of our legacy catalog business and non-core product offerings to a more focused branded store and Internet strategy. Operating profit decreased as a result of lower sales volume, partially offset by a reduction of reserves from the elimination of our customer rewards program and decreased catalog distribution costs.

International 

Net sales in the International segment were higher as a result of the following: 
             
    Acquisitions of Pacific Brands, Champion Europe and Champion Japan licensee; and 
                
    Continued space gains in Asia within our Activewear product category. 
     Partially offset by: 
             
    Unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates; and  
                
    The planned exit of small, low performing brands in Hanes Europe Innerwear.  
     Operating profit increased primarily due to the current year acquisitions, higher sales volume in Asia and cost synergies in our Hanes Europe Innerwear business, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rates.   
  Corporate 
  Corporate expenses included certain administrative costs and acquisition, integration and other action related charges totaling $92 million for   the nine months ended     October 1, 2016   as compared to $212 million for the same period in 2015. Acquisition and integration costs are expenses related directly to an acquisition and its integration into the organization. These costs include legal fees, consulting fees, bank fees, severance costs, certain purchase accounting items, facility closures, inventory write-offs, infrastructure (including information technology), and similar charges. Acquisition related currency transactions represent the foreign exchange gain from financing activities related to the Champion Europe and Pacific Brands acquisitions. Foundational costs are expenses associated with building infrastructure to support and integrate current and future acquisitions; primarily consisting of information technology spend. Other costs relate to other items not included in the aforementioned categories such as charges incurred related to the Target exit from Canada in the first quarter of 2015 and its related bankruptcy and other international realignment and the configuration activities.  Maidenform acquisition and integration costs and Foundational costs were completed in 2015.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and availability under the   $1.0 billion   revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Loan Facility ) under our senior secured credit facility (the  Senior Secured Credit Facility ), our accounts receivable securitization facility (the  Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility ) and our international loan facilities.

     Table of Contents  

At   October 1, 2016  , we had   $908 million   of borrowing availability under our Revolving Loan Facility (after taking into account outstanding letters of credit),   $136 million   of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities which includes our European Revolving Loan Facility,   $450 million   in cash and cash equivalents and   $31 million   borrowing availability under our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. We currently believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with our available credit capacity, will enable us to comply with the terms of our indebtedness and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements. 
  The following have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity: 
             
    we have principal and interest obligations under our debt; 
                
    we acquired Knights Apparel in April 2015, Champion Europe in June 2016 and Pacific Brands in July 2016 and we may pursue additional strategic business acquisitions in the future; 
                
    we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs; 
                 
    we may increase or decrease the portion of the current-year income of our foreign subsidiaries that we remit to the United States, which could significantly impact our effective income tax rate; 
                
    our Board of Directors has authorized a regular quarterly dividend; and 
                
    our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchases under our newly authorized share repurchase program. 
     Dividends 
  As part of our cash deployment strategy, in January, April and July 2016, our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly dividends of $0.11 per share, which were paid in March, June and September of 2016, respectively. On October 25, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share to be paid on December 6, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2016.  
  Share Repurchase Program 
  In April 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program for up to   40 million   shares to be repurchased in open market transactions, subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. The new program replaces our previous share repurchase program for up to   40 million   shares that was originally approved in 2007. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter ended   October 1, 2016  . For the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , we entered into transactions to repurchase   14 million   shares under the previous program at a weighted average repurchase price of   $26.65   per share. The shares were repurchased at a total cost of   $380 million  . For the quarter and nine months ended   October 3, 2015   we repurchased   11 million   shares under the previous share repurchase program at a weighted average purchase price of   $29.15  . The shares were repurchased at a total cost of   $311 million  . At   October 1, 2016  , the remaining repurchase authorization totaled   40 million   shares. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. 
  Cash Requirements for Our Business 
  We rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to meet the cash requirements of our business. The primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal course of business, capital expenditures, maturities of debt and related interest payments, business acquisitions, contributions to our pension plans, repurchases of our stock and regular quarterly dividend payments. We believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings for our foreseeable liquidity needs. 
  There have been no significant changes in the cash requirements for our business from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  .

Sources and Uses of Our Cash 
  The information presented below regarding the sources and uses of our cash flows for the   nine months ended     October 1, 2016   and   October 3, 2015   was derived from our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Operating Activities 
  Our overall liquidity is primarily driven by our strong cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on net income, as well as changes in our working capital. We typically use cash during the first half of the year and generate most of our cash flow in the second half of the year. As compared to prior year, the higher net cash from operating activities is due to changes in working capital, specifically related to inventory and a smaller voluntary pension contribution in the first quarter of 2016 of $40 million compared to $100 million in the same period of 2015. Inventory is in line with our expectations, and our inventory reduction efforts in the first half of 2016 are generating cash flow in the second half of 2016 as planned. 
  Investing Activities 
  The higher net cash used in investing activities is primarily the result of our acquisitions of Pacific Brands and Champion Europe, partially offset by lower capital spending and increased cash proceeds from sale of assets in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, which is primarily the result of cash receipts of $66 million towards an anticipated sale leaseback transaction of one of our manufacturing facilities. 
  Financing Activities 
  The higher net cash from financing activities was primarily the result of the issuance of our three Senior Notes in the second quarter and incurrence of debt under our new Australia term loan facilities offset by lower net borrowings on our other credit facilities and our share repurchases in the first quarter.  
  Financing Arrangements 
  In March 2016, we amended the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility. This amendment primarily extended the termination date to   March 2017   and changed the borrowing capacity from a fixed to a varying limit throughout the year, in order to minimize fees for our unused portion of the facility. 
  In May 2016, we issued   $900 million   aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes and   $900 million   aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes. In June 2016, we issued    500 million   aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Senior Notes. The proceeds from these issuances were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 6.375% Senior Notes, reduce the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility, help fund the acquisitions of Champion Europe and Pacific Brands and pay fees and expenses relating to these transactions. 
  In July 2016, we entered into a Syndicated Facility Agreement, a joinder to our Senior Secured Credit Facility, and established an AUD$200,000 Australian Term A-1 Loan Facility, an AUD$200,000 Australian Term A-2 Loan Facility and an Australia Revolving Facility.  
  In September 2016, we established a    100 million   European Revolving Credit Facility. The proceeds will be used for working capital needs for our Hanes Europe Innerwear business. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we incurred   $40 million   in capitalized debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of new debt related to restructuring our debt through the redemption of our   6.375%   Senior Notes and the issuance of new Senior Notes as discussed above. In addition, we recognized charges of   $47 million   for the call premium and write-off of unamortized debt costs related to the redemption of the 6.375% Senior Notes.

As of   October 1, 2016  , we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facilities. We expect to maintain compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future, however economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed under  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016   or other SEC filings could cause noncompliance. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  . 
  The application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. The critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  . There have been no material changes in these policies from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 2, 2016  .

                 Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  In connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that no changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
