  (Unaudited) 

Note 1. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
       
  Basis of Presentation: 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial reporting and with instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.  These financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which in the opinion of management are considered necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods shown.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  The Company considers that it operates as   one   business segment, a commercial bank. 
    
  Operating results for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Form 10-K Annual Report of Hills Bancorporation and subsidiary (the  Company ) for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on March 9,   2016  .  The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015  , has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements for that period. 
    
  The Company evaluated subsequent events through the filing date of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. 
    
  Effect of New Financial Accounting Standards: 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606).  The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised good or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  For financial institutions, significant changes are not expected given that most financial instruments are not in the scope of the accounting standard update.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.   In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14 deferring the effective date for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods after December 15, 2017.  Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 by the Company is not expected to have a material impact. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02 (Topic 810),   Consolidation  .  The ASU modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIE) or voting interest entities (VOE).  The standard relaxes existing criteria for determining when fees paid to a decision maker or service provider do not represent a variable interest  by focusing on whether those fees are "at market".  The ASU eliminates both the consolidation model specific to limited partnerships and the current presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership.  For public companies, ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted the accounting standard for the period ending March 31, 2016 and have changed the accounting for its tax credit limited partnership investments to the equity method.  The impact of the change was determined to not be material. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30),   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.    ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update.  For public companies, ASU 2015-03 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 for the period ending March 31, 2016.  There was no material impact on the financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles   Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40),   Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.    ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  If it does, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The adoption of ASU 2015-05 by the Company did not have a material impact.

  HILLS BANCORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10),   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.    ASU 2016-01 created Subtopic 321-10,   Investments-Equity Securities    which is applicable to all entities except those in industries that account for substantially all investments at fair value through earnings or the change in net assets.  Under this new subtopic, equity securities are generally required to be measured at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reflected in net income.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The adoption of ASU 2016-01 by the Company is not expected to have a material impact. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 (Topic 842),   Leases  . The ASU provides guidance requiring lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases other than those that meet the definition of short-term leases.  For short-term leases, lessees may elect an accounting policy by class of underlying asset under which these assets and liabilities are not recognized and lease payments are generally recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Under this new ASU, lessees will recognize right-of use assets and lease liabilities for most leases currently accounted for as operating leases under generally accepted accounting principles.  For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  The adoption of ASU 2016-02 by the Company is not expected to have a material impact. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04, Liabilities - Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20),   Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products  .  ASU 2016-04 applies to all entities that offer certain prepaid stored - value products. The ASU provides guidance for the derecognition of financial liabilities related to the issuance of these products and aligns the recognition of breakage to current authoritative guidance. For public companies, ASU 2016-04 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The adoption of ASU 2016-04 by the Company is not expected to have a material impact. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718),   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transaction, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  The adoption of ASU 2016-09 by the Company is not expected to have a material impact. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   The ASU changes the way entities recognize impairment of financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets.  For public companies, ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company is currently analyzing the provisions of this standard to determine the potential impact on the Company's financial statements.  It is too early in this analysis to assess the impact that ASU No. 2016-13 will have on the Company's financial statements.

Note 2. 
    Earnings Per Share 
       
  Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of actual common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur from the exercise of common stock options outstanding.  ESOP shares are considered outstanding for this calculation unless unearned. 
    
  On March 24, 2015, the Company declared a payment of a   2  -for-1 stock split of each issued and unissued share of the Company's common stock outstanding as of April 27, 2015.  The additional shares were issued as a result of the stock split and were mailed to the shareholders as of May 4, 2015.  All shares and earnings per share numbers have been restated for the stock split. 
    
  The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods presented is as follows:

    Securities 
       
  The carrying values of investment securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands): 

Investment securities have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets according to management s intent.  Available-for-sale securities consist of debt securities not classified as trading or held to maturity.  Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related deferred tax effect, are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  There were no trading or held to maturity securities as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . The carrying amount of available-for-sale securities and their approximate fair values were as follows as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities classified according to their contractual maturities at   September 30, 2016  , were as follows (in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016   investment securities with a carrying value of   $62.33 million   were pledged to collateralize repurchase agreements, derivative financial instruments, and other borrowings.

The following table shows the fair value, gross unrealized losses and the percentage of fair value represented by gross unrealized losses of applicable investment securities owned by the Company, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

The Company considered the following information in reaching the conclusion that the impairments disclosed in the table above are temporary and not other-than-temporary impairments.  None of the unrealized losses in the above table was due to the deterioration in the credit quality of any of the issues that might result in the non-collection of contractual principal and interest.  The unrealized losses are due to changes in interest rates.  The Company has not recognized any unrealized loss in income because management does not have the intent to sell the securities included in the previous table.  Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.

The below are descriptions of the credit quality indicators:  
    
  Excellent   Excellent rated loans are prime quality loans covered by highly liquid collateral with generous margins or supported by superior current financial conditions reflecting substantial net worth, relative to total credit extended, and based on assets of a stable and non-speculative nature whose values can be readily verified.  Identified repayment source or cash flow is abundant and assured. 
    
  Good   Good rated loans are adequately secured by readily marketable collateral or good financial condition characterized by liquidity, flexibility and sound net worth.  Loans are supported by sound primary and secondary payment sources and timely and accurate financial information. 
    
  Satisfactory   Satisfactory rated loans are loans to borrowers of average financial means not especially vulnerable to changes in economic or other circumstances, where the major support for the extension is sufficient collateral of a marketable nature, and the  primary source of repayment is seen to be clear and adequate. 
    
  Monitor    Monitor rated loans are identified by management as warranting special attention for a variety of reasons that may bear on ultimate collectability.  This may be due to adverse trends, a particular industry, loan structure, or repayment that is dependent on projections, or a one-time occurrence.   
    
  Special Mention   Special mention rated loans are supported by a marginal payment capacity and are marginally protected by collateral.  There are identified weaknesses that if not monitored and corrected may adversely affect the Company s credit position.  A special mention credit would typically have a weakness in one of the general categories (cash flow, collateral position or payment history) but not in all categories. 
    
  Substandard   Substandard loans are not adequately supported by the paying capacity of the borrower and may be inadequately collateralized.  These loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses.  For these loans, it is more probable than not that the Company could sustain some loss if the deficiency(ies) is not corrected.

Past due loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

  HILLS BANCORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company does not have a material amount of loans that are past due less than 90 days where there are serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms. 
    
  Certain impaired loan information by loan type at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was as follows: 

Loans 90 days or more past due that are still accruing interest decreased   $0.02 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   due to a decrease in the number of loans past due greater than 90 days. As of   September 30, 2016   there were   3   accruing loans past due 90 days or more. The average accruing loans past due as of   September 30, 2016   are   $0.07 million  . There were   5   accruing loans past due 90 days or more as of   December 31, 2015   and the average loan balance was   $0.09 million  . The accruing loans past due 90 days or more balances are believed to be adequately collateralized and the Company expects to collect all principal and interest as contractually due under these loans. 
    
  The Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due.  Such a modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ).  In most cases, the modification is either a reduction in interest rate, conversion to interest only payments or an extension of the maturity date.  The borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term, so a concessionary modification is granted to the borrower that would otherwise not be considered.  TDR loans accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles.

Impaired loans increased   $19.67 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  Impaired loans include any loan that has been placed on nonaccrual status, accruing loans past due 90 days or more and TDR loans.  Impaired loans also include loans that, based on management s evaluation of current information and events, the Company expects to be unable to collect in full according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement.  Impaired loans were   1.61%   of loans held for investment as of   September 30, 2016   and   0.76%   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in impaired loans is due mainly to an increase in nonaccrual loans of   $3.08 million  , a   $16.02 million   agricultural and farmland real estate relationship with a specific allowance for losses, and a decrease in TDR loans of   $2.70 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company regularly reviews a substantial portion of the loans in the portfolio and assesses whether the loans are impaired in accordance with ASC 310.  If the loans are impaired, the Company determines if a specific allowance is appropriate.  In addition, the Company's management also reviews and, where determined necessary, provides allowances for particular loans based upon (1) reviews of specific borrowers and (2) management s assessment of areas that management considers are of higher credit risk, including loans that have been restructured.  Loans that are determined not to be impaired and for which there are no specific allowances are classified into one or more risk categories. Based upon the risk category assigned, the Company allocates a percentage, as determined by management, for a required allowance needed.  The determination of the appropriate percentage begins with historical loss experience factors, which are then adjusted for levels and trends in past due loans, levels and trends in charged-off and recovered loans, trends in volume growth, trends in problem and watch loans, trends in restructured loans, local economic trends and conditions, industry and other conditions, and effects of changing interest rates. 
    
  Specific allowances for losses on impaired loans are established if the loan balances exceed the net present value of the relevant future cash flows or the fair value of the relevant collateral based on updated appraisals and/or updated collateral analysis for the properties if the loan is collateral dependent.  The Company may recognize a charge off or record a specific allowance related to an impaired loan if there is a collateral shortfall or it is unlikely the borrower can make all principal and interest payments as contractually due. 
    
  For loans that are collateral dependent, losses are evaluated based on the portion of a loan that exceeds the fair market value of the collateral.  In general, this is the amount that the carrying value of the loan exceeds the related appraised value less estimated costs to sell the collateral.  Generally, it is the Company s policy not to rely on appraisals that are older than   one year   prior to the date the impairment is being measured.  The most recent appraisal values may be adjusted if, in the Company s judgment, experience and other market data indicate that the property s value, use, condition, exit market or other variable affecting its value may have changed since the appraisal was performed, consistent with the December 2006 joint interagency guidance on the allowance for loan losses.  The charge off or loss adjustment supported by an appraisal is considered the minimum charge off.  Any adjustments made to the appraised value are to provide an additional charge off or specific reserve based on the applicable facts and circumstances.  In instances where there is an estimated decline in value, a specific reserve may be provided or a charge off taken pending confirmation of the amount of the loss from an updated appraisal.  Upon receipt of the new appraisals, an additional specific reserve may be provided or charge off taken based on the appraised value of the collateral.  On average, appraisals are obtained within   one month   of order.

Fair value of financial instruments  :  FASB ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC 820 ) provides a single definition for fair value, a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures concerning fair value.  Fair value is defined under ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. 
    
  The Company determines the fair market value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820.  There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as follows: 

Level 1 
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 
    Observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.  Observable inputs include the quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. 

Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity for financial instruments.  Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

It is the Company s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements.  The Company is required to use observable inputs, to the extent available, in the fair value estimation process unless that data results from forced liquidations or distressed sales.   
    
  The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and for estimating fair value for assets or liabilities not recorded at fair value. 
    
  ASSETS 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents  :  The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and short-term instruments approximate their fair values (Level 1). 
    
  Investment securities available for sale  :  Investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.  Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available.  If a quoted price is not available, the fair value is obtained from benchmarking the security against similar securities.  All of the Company s securities are considered Level 2. 
    
  The pricing for investment securities is obtained from an independent source.  There are no level 1 or level 3 investment securities owned by the Company.  The Company obtains an understanding of the independent source s valuation methodologies used to determine fair value by level of security. The Company validates assigned fair values on a sample basis using an additional third-party provider pricing service to determine if the fair value measurement is reasonable.  Due to the nature of our investment portfolio, we do not expect significant and unusual fluctuations as fair value changes primarily relate to interest rate changes.   No unusual fluctuations were identified during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   If a fluctuation requiring investigation was identified, the Company would research the change with the independent source or other available information. 
    
  Loans held for sale  :  Loans held for sale are carried at historical cost.  The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short time between origination of the loan and its sale on the secondary market (Level 2).  The market is active for these loans and as a result prices for similar assets are available.

  HILLS BANCORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

Loans  :  The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis.  For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values (Level 3).  The fair values for other loans are determined using estimated future cash flows, discounted at the interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers with similar credit quality utilizing an entrance price concept (Level 3).  The Company does record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to loans to reflect (1) partial write-downs that are based on the observable market price or appraised value of the collateral or (2) the full charge-off of the loan carrying value (Level 3).  These loans are considered Level 3 as the instruments used to determine fair market value require significant management judgment and estimation. 
    
  Foreclosed assets  :  The Company does not record foreclosed assets at fair value on a recurring basis.  Foreclosed assets consist mainly of other real estate owned but may include other types of assets repossessed by the Company.  Foreclosed assets are adjusted to the lower of carrying value or fair value less the cost of disposal.   Fair value is generally based upon independent market prices or appraised values of the collateral, and may include a marketability discount as deemed necessary by management based on its experience with similar types of real estate.  The value of foreclosed assets is evaluated periodically as a nonrecurring fair value adjustment.  Foreclosed assets are classified as Level 3. 
    
  Off-balance sheet instruments  :  Fair values for outstanding letters of credit are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing.  The fair value of the outstanding letters of credit is not significant. Unfunded loan commitments are not valued since the loans are generally priced at market at the time of funding (Level 2). 
    
  Accrued interest receivable  :  The fair value of accrued interest receivable equals the amount receivable due to the current nature of the amounts receivable (Level 2). 
    
  Non-marketable equity investments  :  Non-marketable equity investments are recorded under the cost or equity method of accounting.  There are generally restrictions on the sale and/or liquidation of these investments, including stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank.  The carrying value of stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank approximates fair value (Level 2). 
    
  LIABILITIES 
    
  Deposit liabilities  :  Deposit liabilities are carried at historical cost.  The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market account deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.  If the fair value of the fixed maturity certificates of deposit is calculated at less than the carrying amount, the carrying value of these deposits is reported as the fair value (Level 2).  Deposit liabilities are classified as Level 2 due to available prices for similar liabilities in the market. 
    
  Other borrowings  :  Other borrowings are carried at historical cost and include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.  The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the relatively short time between the origination of the liability and its expected realization (Level 2).  Other borrowings are classified as Level 2 due to available prices for similar liabilities in the market. 
    
  Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings  :  Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings are recorded at historical cost.  The fair values of the Company s Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements (Level 2).  Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings are classified as Level 2 due to available prices for similar liabilities in the market. 
    
  Interest Rate Swap Agreements  :  The fair value is estimated using forward-looking interest rate curves and is calculated using discounted cash flows that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data (Level 2). 
    
  Accrued interest payable  :  The fair value of accrued interest payable equals the amount payable due to the current nature of the amounts payable (Level 2).

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
    
  The Company is required to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP.  These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets.  The valuation methodologies used to measure these fair value adjustments are described above.    The following tables present the Company s assets that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

    Stock Repurchase Program 
       
  On July 26, 2005, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to a total of   1,500,000   shares of the Company s common stock (the  2005 Stock Repurchase Program ).  The Company s Board of Directors has authorized the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program through December 31, 2017.  The Company expects the purchases pursuant to the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program to be made from time to time in private transactions at a price equal to the most recent quarterly independent appraisal of the shares of the Company s common stock and with the Board reviewing the overall results of the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program on a quarterly basis.  All purchases made pursuant to the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program since its inception have been made on that basis.  The amount and timing of stock repurchases will be based on various factors, such as the Board s assessment of the Company s capital structure and liquidity, the amount of interest shown by shareholders in selling shares of stock to the Company at their appraised value, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors.  The Company has purchased   939,855   shares of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions from August 1, 2005 through   September 30, 2016  .  Of these   939,855   shares,   13,587   shares were purchased during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , at an average price per share of   $46.41  .

    Commitments and Contingencies 
       
  Concentrations of credit risk  :  The Bank s loans, commitments to extend credit, unused lines of credit and outstanding letters of credit have been granted to customers within the Bank's market area.  Investments in securities issued by state and political subdivisions within the state of Iowa totaled approximately   $77.07 million  .  The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Outstanding letters of credit were granted primarily to commercial borrowers.  Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its debtors' ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the economic conditions in Johnson, Linn and Washington Counties, Iowa. 
    
  Contingencies  :  In the normal course of business, the Company and Bank are involved in various legal proceedings.  While the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, after reviewing pending and threatened litigation with counsel, management believes at this time that the outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk  :  The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, credit card participations and standby letters of credit.  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The Bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, credit card participations and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.  The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  A summary of the Bank s commitments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows: 

Note 9. 
    Income Taxes 
       
  Federal income tax expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was computed using the consolidated effective federal tax rate.  The Company also recognized income tax expense pertaining to state franchise taxes payable individually by the subsidiary bank.  The Company files a consolidated tax return for federal purposes and separate tax returns for State of Iowa purposes.  The tax years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014  , and   2013   remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.  For state tax purposes, the tax years ended   December 31, 2015  ,   2014  , and   2013   remain open for examination.  There were no material unrecognized tax benefits at   September 30, 2016    and   December 31, 2015   and therefore no interest or penalties on unrecognized tax benefits has been recorded.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not anticipate any significant increase in unrecognized tax benefits during the twelve-month period ending September 30, 2017. 
    
  Income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes were   31.40%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   30.68%   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in the effective tax rate is due to a decrease in the amount of low-income housing tax credits earned by the Company in   2016  .

Note 10. 
    Derivative Financial Instruments 
       
  In the normal course of business, the Bank may use derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk.  These instruments carry varying degrees of credit, interest rate and market or liquidity risks.  Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying financial statement and are measured at fair value.  The Bank s objectives are to add stability to its net interest margin and to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.  The contract or notional amount of a derivative is used to determine, along with the other terms of the derivative, the amount to be exchanged between the counterparties.  The Bank is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments.  The Bank minimizes this risk by entering into derivative contracts with large, stable financial institutions.  The Bank has not experienced any losses from nonperformance by counterparties.  The Bank monitors counterparty risk in accordance with the provisions of ASC 815.  In addition, the Bank s interest rate-related derivative instruments contain language outlining collateral pledging requirements for each counterparty.  Collateral must be posted when the market value exceeds certain threshold limits which are determined by credit ratings of each counterparty.  The Bank was required to pledge   $6.11 million   of collateral as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges: 
    
  The Bank executed   two   forward-starting interest rate swap transactions on November 7, 2013.    One   of the interest rate swap transactions had an effective date of November 9, 2015, and an expiration date of November 9, 2020, effectively converting   $25.00 million   of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.  The other interest rate swap transaction has an effective date of November 7, 2016 and an expiration date of November 7, 2023, also to effectively convert   $25.00 million   of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.  For accounting purposes, these swap transactions are designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in cash flows attributable to changes in three-month LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate being hedged, associated with the interest payments made on an amount of the Bank s debt principal equal to the then-outstanding swap notional amount.  At inception, the Bank asserted that the underlying principal balance would remain outstanding throughout the hedge transaction making it probable that sufficient LIBOR-based interest payments would exist through the maturity date of the swaps. 
    
  The table below identifies the balance sheet category and fair values of the Bank s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial information contained within these financial statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. Based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments, management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those which are related to the allowance for loan losses. The Company's allowance for loan losses methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative in establishing an allowance for loan losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date. Quantitative factors include the Company's historical loss experience, delinquency and charge-off trends, collateral values, changes in impaired loans, and other factors. Quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans, including borrowers' sensitivity to interest rate movements. Qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the Company's markets, including  
  economic conditions throughout the Midwest and the state of certain industries.  Determinations relating to the possible level of future loan losses are based in part on subjective judgments by management.  Future loan losses in excess of current estimates, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.  Size and complexity of individual credits in relation to loan structure, existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in the methodology. As the Company adds new products and increases the complexity of its loan portfolio, it will enhance its methodology accordingly. This discussion of the Company s critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein, as well as other relevant portions of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Although management believes the levels of the allowance as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, a decline in local economic conditions, or other factors, could result in increasing losses that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.

  Net income for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   was $  24.84 million   compared to   $22.54 million   for the same   nine   months of   2015  , an increase of   10.24%  .  The   $2.31 million   increase in net income was caused by a number of factors.  The principal factors in the increase in net income for the first   nine   months of   2016   are an increase in net interest income of   $2.97 million   and a decrease in provision for loan losses of   $2.36 million  . These changes were offset by an increase in income tax expense of   $1.40 million  , a decrease in noninterest income of   $0.66 million  , and an increase in noninterest expenses of   $0.97 million  . 
    
  The Company achieved a return on average assets of 1.23% and a return on average equity of 11.59% for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the twelve months ended   September 30, 2015  , which were 1.19% and 10.73%, respectively.  Dividends of $0.65 per share were paid in   January 2016   to 2,334 shareholders.  The   2015   dividend was $0.625 per share. 
    
  The Company s net interest income is the largest component of revenue and it is primarily a function of the average earning assets and the net interest margin percentage.  The Company achieved a net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis of 3.42% for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 3.53% for the same   nine   months of   2015  .

Financial Condition 
    
  Loan demand has been increasing and is expected to remain steady throughout the year ending   December 31, 2016   and into   2017  .  As indicated in the table below, growth in the construction, mortgage 1 to 4 family first and junior liens, and multi-family real estate loans have been primarily responsible for the increase in total loans.   
    
  The following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

The Bank has an established formal loan origination policy.  In general, the loan origination policy attempts to reduce the risk of credit loss to the Bank by requiring, among other things, maintenance of minimum loan to value ratios, evidence of appropriate levels of insurance carried by borrowers and documentation of appropriate types and amounts of collateral and sources of expected payment.  The collateral relied upon in the loan origination policy is generally the property being financed by the Bank.  The source of expected payment is generally the income produced from the property being financed.  Personal guarantees are required of individuals owning or controlling at least 20% of the ownership of an entity.  Limited or proportional guarantees may be accepted in circumstances if approved by the Company s Board of Directors.  Financial information provided by the borrower is verified as considered necessary by reference to tax returns, or audited, reviewed or compiled financial statements.  The Bank does not originate subprime loans.  In order to modify, restructure or otherwise change the terms of a loan, the Bank s policy is to evaluate each borrower situation individually.  Modifications, restructures, extensions and other changes are done to improve the Bank s position and to protect the Bank s capital.  If a borrower is not current with its payments, any additional loans to such borrowers are evaluated on an individual borrower basis. 
    
  The Company has not experienced any significant time lapses in recognizing the required provisions for collateral dependent loans, nor has the Company delayed appropriate charge offs.  When an updated appraisal value has been obtained, the Company has used the appraisal amount in determining the appropriate charge off or required reserve.  The Company also evaluates any changes in the financial condition of the borrower and guarantors (if applicable), economic conditions, and the Company s loss experience with the type of property in question.  Any information utilized in addition to the appraisal is intended to identify additional charge offs or provisions, not to override the appraised value. 
    
  In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, Selected Loan Loss Allowance Methodology and Documentation Issues, the Company determines and assigns ratings to loans using factors that include the following: an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower; a realistic determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral; the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower; an analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories; and a review of delinquent and classified loans. 
    
  Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status, a charge-off or the establishment of a specific impairment reserve. In the event a collateral shortfall is identified during the credit review process, the Company will work with the borrower for a principal reduction and/or a pledge of additional collateral and/or additional guarantees. In the event that these options are not available, the loan may be subject to a downgrade of the credit risk rating. If the Company determines a loan amount or portion thereof, is uncollectible, the loan s credit risk rating may be downgraded and the uncollectible amount charged-off or recorded as a specific allowance for losses.  The Bank s credit and legal departments undertake a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the loan to minimize actual losses.

The following table presents the allowance for loan losses on loans by loan category, the percentage of the allowance for each category to the total allowance, and the percentage of all loans in each category to total loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The allowance for loan losses totaled   $26.14 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $26.51 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The percentage of the allowance to outstanding loans was   1.17%   and   1.25%   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The allowance was based on management s consideration of a number of factors, including composition of the loan portfolio, loans with higher credit risks and the overall amount of loans outstanding.  The decrease in the allowance in   2016   is the result of an increase in net loans and a change in the composition and allocation of loans within credit quality ratings partially offset by net recoveries. 
    
  The adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly and adjusted as appropriate after consideration has been given to the impact of economic conditions on the borrowers  ability to repay, loan collateral values, past collection experience, the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and such other factors that deserve current recognition. The growth of the loan portfolio and the trends in problem and watch loans are significant elements in the determination of the provision for loan losses.  Quantitative factors include the Company s historical loss experience, which is then adjusted for levels and trends in past due, levels and trends in charged-off and recovered loans, trends in volume growth, trends in problem and watch loans, trends in restructured loans, local economic trends and conditions, industry and other conditions, and effects of changing interest rates. 
    
  Management has determined that the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at   September 30, 2016  , and that the loan portfolio is diversified and secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. This process involves a high degree of management judgment; however, the allowance for loan losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors. The relative level of allowance for loan losses is reviewed and compared to industry data. This review encompasses levels of total impaired loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations, current geographic risks and overall levels of net charge-offs.

Residential real estate loan products that include features such as loan-to-values in excess of 100% or interest only payments, which expose a borrower to payment increases in excess of changes in the market interest rate, increase the credit risk of a loan.  The Bank has not offered and does not intend to offer this type of loan product. 
    
  Investment securities available for sale held by the Company decreased by   $13.62 million   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  The fair value of securities available for sale was   $3.35 million   more than the amortized cost of such securities as of   September 30, 2016  .  At   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of the securities available for sale was $2.24 million more than the amortized cost of such securities.

Repurchase agreements decreased $4.15 million and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings decreased $15.00 million since   December 31, 2015  .  In the opinion of the Company s management, the Company continues to have sufficient liquidity resources available to fund expected additional loan growth. 
    
  Brokered deposits are included in total deposits and totaled   $80.10 million   as of   September 30, 2016   with an average rate of 0.54%.  Brokered deposits were $62.74 million as of   December 31, 2015   with an average interest rate of 0.42%. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , brokered deposits were   4.01%   and 3.32% of total deposits, respectively. 
    
  Dividends and Equity 
    
  In   January 2016  , Hills Bancorporation paid a dividend of $6.06 million or $0.65 per share.  The dividend was $0.625 per share in   January 2015  .  After payment of the dividend and the adjustment for accumulated other comprehensive income, stockholders  equity as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $286.06 million  .  On January 1, 2015, the final rules of the Federal Reserve Board went into effect implementing in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  The final rule also adopted changes to the agencies  regulatory capital requirements that meet the requirements of section 171 and section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 
    
  Under the BASEL III rules, the minimum capital ratios are 4% for Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio, 4.5% for the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio, 6% for the Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio and 8% for the Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio.  A new capital conservation buffer is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve s minimum and well-capitalized definition requirements.  The actual amounts and capital ratios as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented below (amounts in thousands):

  Net Income Overview 
    
  Net income increased   $2.31 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  .  Total net income was   $24.84 million   in   2016   and   $22.54 million   in the comparable period in   2015  , an increase of   10.24%  .  The changes in net income in   2016   from the first   nine   months of   2015   were primarily the result of the following: 

Net interest income increased by   $2.97 million  , before provision expense.  Total interest income increased by $  4.06 million   as a result of growth in the volume of earning assets.  Total interest expense increased by $  1.09 million   as a result of $1.58 million in additional FHLB borrowings interest expense. 
                
    The provision for loan losses decreased by   $2.36 million  . 
                
    Noninterest income decreased by $  0.66 million  . 
                
    Noninterest expenses increased by $  0.97 million  . 
                
    Income tax expense increased by   $1.40 million  . 
       
  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   basic earnings per share was   $2.67   and   $2.41  , respectively.  Diluted earnings per share was   $2.67   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  2.41   for the same period in   2015  .  
    
  The Company s net income continues to be driven primarily by three important factors.  The first important factor is the interaction between changes in net interest margin and changes in average volumes of the Bank's earnings assets.  Net interest income of   $60.50 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   was derived from the Company s $2.435 billion of average earning assets during that period and its tax-equivalent net interest margin of 3.42%.  Average earning assets in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were $2.260 billion and the tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.53%.  The importance of net interest margin is illustrated by the fact that an increase or decrease in the net interest margin of 10 basis points would have resulted approximately in a $1.83 million change in income before income taxes in the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  .  Net interest income for the Company increased primarily as a result of growth in the volume of earning assets.  The Company expects net interest compression to continue to impact earnings for the foreseeable future.  The Company believes growth in net interest income will be contingent on the growth of the Company s earnings assets. 
    
  The second significant factor affecting the Company s net income is the provision for loan losses. The majority of the Company s interest-earning assets are in loans outstanding, which amounted to more than   $2.210 billion   at   September 30, 2016  .  The provision is computed on a quarterly basis and is a result of management s determination of the quality of the loan portfolio.  The provision reflects a number of factors, including the size of the loan portfolio, the overall composition of the loan portfolio and loan concentrations, the borrowers  ability to repay, past loss experience, loan collateral values, the level of impaired loans and loans past due ninety days or more.  In addition, management considers the credit quality of the loans based on management s review of problem and watch loans, including loans with historically higher credit risk.  The provision for loan losses was a reduction of expense of $2.00 million in   2016   compared to an expense of $  0.36 million   in   2015  .  The Company believes that the provision for loan losses will increase for the foreseeable future resulting from projected increases in the size of the Company s loan portfolio. 
    
  The third significant factor affecting the Company s net income is income tax expense.  Federal and state income tax expenses were   $11.37 million   and   $9.97 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes were   31.40%   in   2016   and   30.68%   in   2015  .

  Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income increased for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the comparable period in   2015  .  The increase was as a result of growth in the average volume of earning assets.  Net interest income is the excess of the interest and fees earned on interest-earning bearing assets over the interest expense of the interest-bearing liabilities.  The factors that have the greatest impact on net interest income are the average volume of earning assets for the period and the net interest margin.  The net interest margin for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   3.42%   compared to   3.53%   in   2015   for the same period.  The measure is shown on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 35% to make the interest earned on taxable and non-taxable assets more comparable.  The change in average balances and average rates between periods and the effect on the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the   nine   months ended in   2016   compared to the comparable period in   2015   are shown in the following table: 

Rate/volume variances are allocated on a consistent basis using the absolute values of changes in volume compared to the absolute values of the changes in rates.  Loan fees included in interest income are not material.  Interest on nontaxable securities and loans is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. 
    
  A summary of the net interest spread and margin is as follows:

  In pricing loans and deposits, the Bank considers the U.S. Treasury indexes as benchmarks in determining interest rates.  The Federal Open Market Committee met six times during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  The target rate remains unchanged since December, 2015 at 0.50%.  Interest rates on loans are generally affected by the target rate since interest rates for the U.S. Treasury market normally increase or decrease when the Federal Reserve Board raises or lowers the federal funds rate.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the rate indexes for the one, three and five year indexes were 0.59%, 0.88% and 1.14%, respectively.  The one year index increased 73.52% from 0.34% at   September 30, 2015  , the three year index increased 12.50% and the five year index decreased 22.45%.  The three year index was 0.99% and the five year index was 1.47% at   September 30, 2015  .  The targeted federal funds rate was 0.50% and 0.25% at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The Company anticipates possible increases in short term and long term rates in the indexes for 2017. 
    
  Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  The provision for loan losses was a reduction of expense of $2.00 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to an expense of $  0.36 million   in   2015  , an expense decrease of   $2.36 million  .  The loan loss provision is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to the level considered by management to appropriately account for the estimated impairment to the Bank's loan portfolio.  The provision expense taken to fund the allowance for loan losses is computed on a quarterly basis and is a result of management s determination of the quality of the loan portfolio.  The provision reflects a number of factors, including the size of the loan portfolio, the overall composition of the loan portfolio and loan concentrations, the impact on the borrowers  ability to repay, past loss experience, loan collateral values, the level of impaired loans and loans past due ninety days or more.  In addition, management considers the credit quality of the loans based on management s review of problem and watch loans, including loans with historical higher credit risks.  The decrease in expense in   2016   is the net result of an increase in net loans, the effects of loan recoveries in 2016, a change in the composition and allocation of loans within credit quality ratings, improvement in qualitative factor adjustments, and a specific allowance recorded for a $16.02 agricultural and farmland real estate loan relationship. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses decreased $  0.37 million   during the first   nine   months of   2016  .  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , there was a decrease of $0.53 million due to composition of loans outstanding and a $0.16 million increase in the amount allocated to the allowance due to credit quality. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses balance is affected by charge-offs, net of recoveries, for the periods presented.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    and   2015  , recoveries were   $3.15 million   and $  3.58 million  , respectively; and charge-offs were $  1.52 million   in   2016   and $  2.48 million   in   2015  .  The allowance for loan losses totaled   $26.14 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to $  26.51 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The allowance represented   1.17%   and   1.25%   of loans held for investment at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

  Noninterest Income 
    
  The following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest income for the   nine     months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Loans originated for sale in the first   nine     months of   2016   totaled $151.55 million compared to $133.52 million in the same period in   2015  , an increase of 13.50%.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the net gain on sale of loans was   $1.44 million   and   $1.14 million  , respectively.  The amount of the net gain on sale of secondary market mortgage loans in each year can vary significantly.  The volume of activity in these types of loans is directly related to the level of interest rates.  The servicing of the loans sold into the secondary market is not retained by the Company so these loans do not provide an ongoing stream of income.  The Company believes residential mortgage interest rates will continue to rise for the foreseeable future resulting in decreased net gain on sale of loan income. 
    
  The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 for the period ending March 31, 2016 and have changed the accounting for its tax credit limited partnership investments to the equity method. As a result the Company no longer records gross rental revenue on tax credit real estate as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company recorded net income from its investments in tax credit partnerships of $(0.02) million as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The net gain on sale of other real estate owned and other repossessed assets increased $0.24 million to a net gain of   $0.38 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The total net gain on sale of other real estate owned for the   nine   months ended consisted of a $0.38 million net gain on the sale of nine properties. During the same period in   2015  , the gain consisted of a $0.20 million net gain on sale of 13 properties offset by a $0.06 million fair market value adjustment on three properties. 
    
  Trust fees increased   $0.27 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015   due to new trust relationships.

  Net income increased $  1.49 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Total net income was   $9.18 million   in   2016   and $  7.69 million   in the comparable period in   2015  , an increase of   19.40%  .  For the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   basic earning per share was $  0.99   and $  0.82  , respectively.  Diluted earnings per share was $  0.99   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $  0.82   for the same period in   2015  .  
    
  Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income increased for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the comparable period in   2015  .  The increase was primarily the result of growth in the volume of earning assets.  Net interest income is the excess of the interest and fees earned on interest-earning bearing assets over the interest expense of the interest-bearing liabilities.  The factors that have the greatest impact on net interest income are the volume of average earning assets and the net interest margin.  The net interest margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   3.49%   compared to   3.52%   in   2015   for the same period.  The measure is shown on a tax-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 35% to make the interest earned on taxable and non-taxable assets more comparable.  The change in average balances and average rates between periods and the effect on the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the three months ended in   2016   compared to the comparable period in   2015   are shown in the following table:

Rate/volume variances are allocated on a consistent basis using the absolute values of changes in volume compared to the absolute values of the changes in rates.  Loan fees included in interest income are not material.  Interest on nontaxable securities and loans is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. 
    
  A summary of the net interest spread and margin is as follows: 

Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  The provision for loan losses was a reduction of expense of $  1.83 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to a reduction of expense of $  0.10 million   in   2015  , an expense decrease of $  1.73 million  .  The loan loss provision is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to the level considered by management to appropriately account for the estimated impairment to the Bank's loan portfolio.  The provision expense taken to fund the allowance for loan losses is computed on a quarterly basis and is a result of management s determination of the quality of the loan portfolio.  The provision reflects a number of factors, including the size of the loan portfolio, the overall composition of the loan portfolio and loan concentrations, the impact on the borrowers  ability to repay, past loss experience, loan collateral values, the level of impaired loans and loans past due ninety days or more.  In addition, management considers the credit quality of the loans based on management s review of problem and watch loans, including loans with historical higher credit risks.

Discussion of operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.15 million during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  .  In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , there was a $0.41 million decrease in the amount allocated to the allowance due to credit quality and a $0.74 million decrease due to the composition of loans outstanding. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses balance is affected by charge-offs, net of recoveries, for the periods presented.  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , recoveries were $  1.16 million   and $  0.54 million  , respectively; and charge-offs were $  0.48 million   in   2016   and $  0.76 million   in   2015  .  The allowance for loan losses totaled $  26.14 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to $  26.51 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The allowance represented   1.17%   and   1.25%   of loans held for investment at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Noninterest Income 
    
  The following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

In the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the net gain on sale of loans was $  0.60 million   and $  0.40 million   , respectively.  The amount of the net gain on sale of secondary market mortgage loans in each year can vary significantly.  The volume of activity in these types of loans is directly related to the level of interest rates.  The servicing of the loans sold into the secondary market is not retained by the Company so these loans do not provide an ongoing stream of income.  The Company believes residential mortgage interest rates will continue to rise for the foreseeable future resulting in decreased net gain on sale of loan income. 
    
  Trust fees increased $  0.06 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015   due to new trust relationships. 
    
  The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 for the period ending March 31, 2016 and have changed the accounting for its tax credit limited partnership investments to the equity method. As a result the Company no longer records gross rental revenue on tax credit real estate as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company recorded net income from its investments in tax credit partnerships of $(0.02) million as of   September 30, 2016  .

  Noninterest Expenses 
    
  The following table sets forth the various categories of noninterest expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

In the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , salaries and employee benefits expense increased   $1.03 million  .  The increase is primarily the result of annual salary adjustments  and hiring of additional employees to staff branch growth.  Other noninterest expense categories experienced marginal period-to-period increases for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 for the period ending March 31, 2016 and have changed the accounting for its tax credit limited partnership investments to the equity method. As a result the Company no longer records gross rental expenses on tax credit real estate as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Income Taxes 
    
  Federal and state income tax expenses were   $4.40 million   and   $3.54 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes were   32.40%   in   2016   and   31.52%   in   2015  . 

Liquidity 
    
  The Company actively monitors and manages its liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient cash flows to fund operations, meet client commitments, take advantage of market opportunities and provide a margin against unforeseeable liquidity needs.  Federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale are readily marketable assets.  Maturities of all investment securities are managed to meet the Company s normal liquidity needs, to respond to market changes or to adjust the Company s interest rate risk position.  Investment securities available for sale comprised   9.66%   of the Company s total assets at   September 30, 2016   compared to   10.60%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Company has historically maintained a stable deposit base and a relatively low level of large deposits, which has mitigated the volatility in the Company s liquidity position.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had borrowed   $210.00 million   from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) of Des Moines.  Advances are used as a means of providing both long and short-term, fixed-rate funding for certain assets and for managing interest rate risk.  The Company had additional borrowing capacity available from the FHLB of approximately $428.77 million at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As additional sources of liquidity, the Company has the ability to borrow up to $10.00 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and has lines of credit with three banks totaling $217.77 million.  The borrowings under these credit lines would be secured by the Bank s investment securities.  The combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets, low dependence on volatile liabilities and additional borrowing capacity provided sources of liquidity for the Company which management considered sufficient at   September 30, 2016  .

As of   September 30, 2016  , investment securities with a carrying value of $62.33 million were pledged to collateralize public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements, derivative financial instruments, and other borrowings.  As of   December 31, 2015  , investment securities with a carrying value of $69.52 million were pledged. 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  There have been no material changes with regard to contractual obligations disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The Company's primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates.  Interest rate risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates.  Interest rate risk arises from repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk.  Repricing risk is the difference between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows.  Basis risk is the difference from changing rate relationships among different yield curve affecting Bank activities.  Yield curve risk is the difference from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities.  Option risk is the difference resulting from interest-related options imbedded in Bank products.  The Bank s primary source of interest rate risk exposure arises from repricing risk.  To measure this risk the Bank uses a static gap measurement system that identifies the repricing gaps across the full maturity spectrum of the Bank s assets and liabilities and an earnings simulation approach.  The gap schedule is known as the interest rate sensitivity report.  The report reflects the repricing characteristics of the Bank s assets and liabilities.  The report details the calculation of the gap ratio.  This ratio indicates the amount of interest-earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest-bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time.  A gap ratio of 1.0 indicates a matched position, in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal.  A gap ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period, and a ratio greater than 1.0 indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities. 
    
  The Company's asset/liability management, or its management of interest rate risk, is focused primarily on evaluating and managing net interest income given various risk criteria.  Factors beyond the Company's control, such as market interest rates and competition, may also have an impact on the Company's interest income and interest expense.  In the absence of other factors, the Company's overall yield on interest-earning assets will increase as will its cost of funds on its interest-bearing liabilities when market interest rates increase over an extended period of time.  Inversely, the Company's yields and cost of funds will decrease when market rates decline.  The Company is able to manage these swings to some extent by attempting to control the maturity or rate adjustments of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities over given periods of time. 
    
  The Bank maintains an Asset/Liability Committee, which meets at least quarterly to review the interest rate sensitivity position and to review and develop various strategies for managing interest rate risk within the context of the following factors: 1) capital adequacy, 2) asset/liability mix, 3) economic outlook, 4) market characteristics and 5) the interest rate forecast.  In addition, the Bank uses a simulation model to review various assumptions relating to interest rate movement.  The model attempts to limit rate risk even if it appears the Bank s asset and liability maturities are perfectly matched and a favorable interest margin is present.  The Bank s policy is to generally maintain a balance between profitability and interest rate risk. 
    
  In order to minimize the potential effects of adverse material and prolonged increases or decreases in market interest rates on the Company's operations, management has implemented an asset/liability program designed to mitigate the Company's interest rate sensitivity.  The program emphasizes the origination of adjustable rate loans, which are held in the portfolio, the investment of excess cash in short or intermediate term interest-earning assets, and the solicitation of transaction deposit accounts, which are less sensitive to changes in interest rates and can be re-priced rapidly. 
    
  The Bank's interest rate risk, as monitored by management, has not changed materially from   December 31, 2015  .

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting.

    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

The following table sets forth information about the Company s stock purchases, all of which were made pursuant to the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)  On July 26, 2005, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock (the  2005 Stock Repurchase Program ).  The Company s Board of Directors has authorized the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program through December 31, 2017.  The Company expects the purchases pursuant to the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program to be made from time to time in private transactions at a price equal to the most recent quarterly independent appraisal of the shares of the Company s common stock and with the Board reviewing the overall results of the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program on a quarterly basis.  All purchases made pursuant to the 2005 Stock Repurchase Program since its inception have been made on that basis.  The amount and timing of stock repurchases will be based on various factors, such as the Board s assessment of the Company s capital structure and liquidity, the amount of interest shown by shareholders in selling shares of stock to the Company at their appraised value, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors.
