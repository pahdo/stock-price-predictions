1. Organization and Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation  

Description of Business   

Synthetic Biologics, Inc. (the  Company 
or  Synthetic Biologics ) is a clinical stage company developing therapeutics to protect the gut microbiome while targeting
pathogen-specific diseases. The Company s lead candidates poised for Phase 3 development are: (1) SYN-010 which is intended
to reduce the impact of methane-producing organisms in the gut microbiome to treat an underlying cause of irritable bowel syndrome
with constipation (IBS-C), and (2) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to protect the gut microbiome from the effects of certain
commonly used intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics for the prevention of  C. difficile  infection (CDI), antibiotic-associated
diarrhea (AAD) and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In collaboration with Intrexon Corporation ( Intrexon ),
the Company is also developing preclinical stage monoclonal antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of pertussis, and
novel discovery stage biotherapeutics for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). 

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial information. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP )
for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, comprised
of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary by management to fairly state our results of operations, financial position
and cash flows. The operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for
any other interim period or for the full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K. The interim
results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires
the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the
amounts of revenue and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and
the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ
from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
and Developments   

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 to clarify whether the following items should be categorized
as operating, investing or financing in the statement of cash flows: (i) debt prepayments and extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement
of zero-coupon debt, (iii) settlement of contingent consideration, (iv) insurance proceeds, (v) settlement of corporate-owned life
insurance (COLI) and bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies, (vi) distributions from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial
interests in securitization transactions, and (viii) receipts and payments with aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  Accordingly,
ASU No. 2014-015 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 ,
 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its condensed
consolidated financial statements.  

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic
718) , which is part of the FASB's Simplification Initiative. The updated guidance simplifies the accounting for share-based
payment transactions. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard
on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , which establishes a new lease accounting model for lessees. The updated guidance requires an
entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional
qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, guidance which defines management's responsibility to
evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote
disclosures. This guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim
periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard
on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers , to provide guidance on revenue recognition. ASU No. 2014-09 requires a company to recognize revenue
when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates
than under today s guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount
of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance
obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of
the Effective Date , which provided for the adoption of the new standard for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
Accordingly, ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption up to the first quarter
of 2017 is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU No. 2014-09 can be applied retrospectively to all periods presented or only to the most
current period presented with the cumulative effect of changes reflected in the opening balance of retained earnings in the most
current period presented. The FASB has also issued the following standards which clarify ASU No. 2014-09 and have the same effective
date as the original standard: 

ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ;   

ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients .   

The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and
the impact of adopting ASU No. 2014-09 on its results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  

2. Management s Plan  

The Company has incurred an accumulated
deficit of $169.7 million through September 30, 2016. With the exception of the quarter ended June 30, 2010, the Company has incurred
negative cash flow from operations since its inception. The Company has spent, and expects to continue to spend, substantial amounts
in connection with implementing its business strategy, including its planned product development efforts, clinical trials and research
and discovery efforts. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.5 million. Based
upon the Company s current business plans, management does not believe that the Company s current cash on hand will
be sufficient to execute its near term plans. The Company will be required to obtain additional funding in order to continue the
development of its current product candidates within the anticipated time periods, if at all, and to continue to fund operations
at the current cash expenditure levels, although it does not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide it with
capital. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of equity (including through the
 at-the-market  Issuance Sales Agreement (the  FBR Sales Agreement ) that the Company entered into with
FBR Capital Markets   Co. in August 2016) or debt and other sources. The Company cannot assure that it will meet the requirements
for use of the FBR Sales Agreement or that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company fails
to obtain additional funding in the next few months and otherwise when needed, it will not be able to execute its business plan
as planned and will be forced to cease certain development activities until funding is received and its business will suffer, which
would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. These factors raise doubt
regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The
condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

The actual amount of funds the Company
will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond the Company s control. These factors include the
following: 

the
progress of research activities;  

the
number and scope of research programs;  

the
progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;  

the
progress of the development efforts of parties with whom the Company has entered into research and development agreements;  

costs
associated with additional clinical trials of product candidates;  

the
ability to maintain current research and development licensing arrangements and to establish new research and development, and
licensing arrangements;  

the
ability to achieve milestones under licensing arrangements;  

the
costs associated with manufacturing-related services to produce material for use in its clinical trials;  

the
costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and  

the
costs and timing of regulatory approvals.  

The Company has based its estimates on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong. The Company may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than it currently
anticipates. 

If the Company raises funds by selling
additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of the existing stockholders
will be diluted. If the Company is not able to obtain financing when needed, it may be unable to carry out its business plan. As
a result, the Company may have to significantly limit its operations and its business, financial condition and results of operations
would be materially harmed. 

3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The fair value accounting standards define
fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants. As such, fair value is determined based upon assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
asset or liability. Fair value measurements are rated on a three-tier hierarchy as follows: 

Level
1 inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;  

Level
2 inputs: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and  

Level
3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own
assumptions.  

If the inputs used to measure fair value
fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the hierarchy level is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement. 

Cash and cash equivalents include money
market accounts of $1.3 million and $5.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, that are measured
using Level 1 inputs. 

The warrants issued in conjunction with the registered direct offering in October 2014 include a provision
that if the Company were to enter into a certain transaction, as defined in the agreement, the warrants would be purchased from
the holder at a premium. Accordingly, the Company recorded the warrants as liabilities at their fair value upon issuance and re-measures
the fair value at each period end with the change in fair value recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes options pricing model to estimate the fair value of the warrants. In using this model, the fair
value is determined by applying Level 3 inputs for which there is little or no observable market data, requiring the Company to
develop its own assumptions. The assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair value of the warrants represent the Company s
best estimates; however, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result,
if factors change and different assumptions are used, the warrant liability and the change in estimated fair value could be materially
different. 

4. Selected Balance Sheet Information  

Prepaid
expenses and other current assets (in thousands)   

The Intrexon prepaid research and development
expenses are classified as a current asset. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had applied all the of the Intrexon prepaid research
and development expenses to research and development expenses. 

Prepaid
clinical research organization expense is classified as a current asset. The Company makes payments to the clinical research organizations
based on agreed upon terms that includes payments in advance of study services. The Company anticipates that the majority of the
prepaid clinical research organization expenses will be applied to research and development expenses during the balance of 2016.

5. Stock-Based Compensation  

Stock Incentive Plan   

During 2001, the Company s Board
of Directors and stockholders adopted the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2001 Stock Plan ). The total number of shares
of stock with respect to which stock options and stock appreciation rights may be granted to any one employee of the Company or
a subsidiary during any one-year period under the 2001 Stock Plan shall not exceed 250,000. All awards pursuant to the 2001 Stock
Plan shall terminate upon the termination of the grantee s employment for any reason. Awards include options, restricted
shares, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and cash-based awards (the  Awards ). The 2001 Stock Plan contains
certain anti-dilution provisions in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or other capital adjustment, as defined in the plan.
The 2001 Stock Plan provides for a committee of the Board to grant Awards and to determine the exercise price, vesting term, expiration
date and all other terms and conditions of the Awards, including acceleration of the vesting of an Award at any time. As of September
30, 2016, there were 228,773 options issued and outstanding under the 2001 Stock Plan. 

On March 20, 2007, the Company s
Board of Directors approved the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2007 Stock Plan ) for the issuance of up to 2,500,000
shares of common stock to be granted through incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend
equivalent rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to officers, other employees, directors
and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. This plan was approved by stockholders on November 2, 2007. The exercise price
of stock options under the 2007 Stock Plan is determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, and may be equal
to or greater than the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date the option is granted. The total number
of shares of stock with respect to which stock options and stock appreciation rights may be granted to any one employee of the
Company or a subsidiary during any one-year period under the 2007 Stock Plan shall not exceed 250,000. Options become exercisable
over various periods from the date of grant, and generally expire ten years after the grant date. As of September 30, 2016, there
were 789,155 options issued and outstanding under the 2007 Stock Plan. 

On November 2, 2010, the Board of Directors
and stockholders adopted the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan ( 2010 Stock Plan ) for the issuance of up to 3,000,000 shares
of common stock to be granted through incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend
equivalent rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to officers, other employees, directors 
and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. On October 22, 2013, the stockholders approved and adopted an amendment to
the 2010 Stock Plan to increase the number of shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance under the 2010 Stock
Plan from 3,000,000 to 6,000,000. On May 15, 2015, the stockholders approved and adopted an amendment to the 2010 Stock Plan to
increase the number of shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance under the 2010 Stock Plan from 6,000,000
to 8,000,000. On August 25, 2016, the stockholders approved and adopted an amendment to the 2010 Stock Plan to increase the number
of shares of the Company s common stock reserved for issuance under the 2010 Stock Plan from 8,000,000 to 14,000,000. The
exercise price of stock options under the 2010 Stock Plan is determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors,
and may be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date the option is granted.
There is no limit on the number or the value of the shares with respect to which stock options and stock appreciation rights may
be granted to any one employee of the Company or a subsidiary during any one-year period. Options become exercisable over various
periods from the date of grant, and generally expire ten years after the grant date. As of September 30, 2016, there were 7,495,624
options issued and outstanding under the 2010 Stock Plan. 

In the event of an employee s termination,
the Company will cease to recognize compensation expense for that employee. There is no deferred compensation recorded upon initial
grant date, instead, the fair value of the stock-based payment is recognized ratably over the stated vesting period. 

The Company has applied fair value accounting
for all stock-based payment awards since inception. The fair value of each option or warrant granted is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. There were no options granted during the three months ending September 30,
2016 and for the same period in 2015. The Black-Scholes assumptions used in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are
as follows: 

The Company records stock-based compensation
based upon the stated vested provisions in the related agreements. The vesting provisions for these agreements have various terms
as follows: 

immediate vesting,   

half vesting immediately and remaining over three years,   

quarterly over three years,   

annually over three years,   

one-third immediate vesting and remaining annually over two years,   

one half immediate vesting and remaining over nine months,   

one quarter immediate vesting and remaining over three years,   

one quarter immediate vesting and remaining over 33 months; and   

monthly over three years.   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company granted 560,000 options to employees having an approximate fair value of $962,000 based upon the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. During the same period in 2015, the Company granted 1,800,000 options to employees having an approximate
fair value of $3.2 million based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 

A summary of stock option activities as of September 30, 2016,
and for the year ended December 31, 2015, is as follows: 

Stock-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses and research and development
expenses related to stock options issued to employees and consultants for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was
$ 946,000 and $646,000, respectively, and $2,906,000 and $2,059,000 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, total unrecognized
stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $5.7 million, which is expected to be expensed through July 2018. 

6.   Stock Purchase Warrants  

On October 10, 2014, the Company raised
net proceeds of $19.1 million through the sale of 14,059,616 units at a price of $1.47 per unit to certain institutional investors
in a registered direct offering. Each unit consisted of one share of the Company s common stock and a warrant to purchase
0.5 shares of common stock. The warrants, exercisable for an aggregate of 7,029,808 shares of common stock, have an exercise price
of $1.75 per share and a life of five years. The warrants vested immediately and expire October 10, 2019. 

The warrants issued in conjunction with the registered direct offering in October 2014 include a provision
that if the Company were to enter into a certain transaction, as defined in the agreement, the warrants would be purchased from
the holder at a premium. Accordingly, the Company recorded the warrants as a liability at their estimated fair value on the issuance
date, which was $7.4 million, and changes in estimated fair value will be recorded as non-cash income or expense in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations at each subsequent period. At September 30, 2016, the fair value of the warrant liability
was $6.9 million, which resulted in non-cash income of $666,000 and $3.7 million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively. At September 30, 2015, the fair value of the warrant liability was $10.7 million, which represented non-cash
income of $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and non-cash expense of $3.9 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, the warrants were valued on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes valuation model. The assumptions used by the Company are summarized in the following table: 

The following
table summarizes the estimated fair value of the warrant liability  (in thousands)  : 

As of September 30, 2016, all of the warrants remained outstanding.  

On October 25, 2012, the Company entered
into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors. As part of this agreement, the Company issued warrants
to purchase 635,855 shares of common stock to the placement agent, or its permitted assigns. The warrants have an exercise price
of $1.60 and a life of five years. The warrants vested immediately and expire October 25, 2017. Since these warrants were granted
as part of an equity raise, the Company has treated them as a direct offering cost. The result of the transaction has no affect
to equity. Warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2016 were 311,834. 

A summary of warrant activity for the Company
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

A summary of all outstanding and exercisable
warrants as of September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

7. Net Loss per Share  

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
including the effect of common share equivalents. Diluted net loss per share assumes the issuance of potential dilutive common
shares outstanding for the period and adjusts for any changes in income and the repurchase of common shares that would have occurred
from the assumed issuance, unless such effect is anti-dilutive. The number of options and warrants for the purchase of common stock
that were excluded from the computations of net loss per common share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were
16,372,451, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were 8,331,020 and 15,360,828, respectively. 

The following tables set forth the computation
of diluted net loss per weighted average number of shares outstanding attributable to Synthetic Biologics and Subsidiaries for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015  (in thousands except share and per share amounts) :  

8. Non-controlling Interest  

The Company s non-controlling interest is accounted for under ASC 810,  Consolidation  ( ASC
810 ) and represents the minority shareholder s ownership interest related to the Company s subsidiary, Synthetic
Biomics, Inc. ( SYN Biomics ). In accordance with ASC 810, the Company reports its non-controlling interest in subsidiaries
as a separate component of equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and reports both net loss attributable to the non-controlling
interest and net loss attributable to the Company and its subsidiaries on the face of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The Company s equity interest in SYN Biomics is 88.5% and the non-controlling stockholder s interest is
11.5%. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the accumulated net loss attributable to the non-controlling interest
was $136,000 and $451,000, respectively. 

9. FBR Sales Agreement  

On
August 5, 2016, the Company entered into the FBR Sales Agreement with FBR Capital Markets   Co., which enables the
Company to offer and sell shares of the Company s common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to $40.0 million,
from time to time through FBR Capital Markets   Co. as the Company s sales agent. Sales of common stock under the
FBR Sales Agreement are made in sales deemed to be  at-the-market  equity offerings as defined in Rule 415
promulgated under the Securities Act, as amended. FBR Capital Markets   Co. is entitled to receive a commission rate of
up 3.0%    of gross sales in connection with the sale of
the Company s common stock sold on the Company s behalf. From August 11, 2016 through September 30, 2016, the
Company had sold through the FBR Sales Agreement an aggregate of 380,265 shares of the Company's common stock, and received
gross proceeds of approximately $650,000, before deducting issuance expenses. Subsequent to  quarter end, the Company
has sold approximately 520,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and received gross proceeds of approximately $900,000. 

10. Related Party Transactions.  

In December 2013, through the Company s
subsidiary, Synthetic Biomics, Inc., the Company entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center  CSMC  and acquired the rights to develop products for therapeutic and prophylactic treatments of acute and
chronic diseases, including the development of SYN-010 to target IBS-C. The Company licensed from CSMC a portfolio of intellectual
property comprised of several U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications for various fields of use, including IBS-C,
obesity and diabetes. An investigational team led by Mark Pimentel, M.D. at CSMC discovered that these products may reduce the
production of methane gas by certain GI microorganisms. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
paid Cedars-Sinai Medical Center $350,000 for milestone payments related this license agreement. There were no milestone payments
made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Overview  

 We are a clinical stage company developing
therapeutics to protect the gut microbiome while targeting pathogen-specific diseases. Our lead candidates poised for Phase 3 development
are: (1) SYN-010 which is intended to reduce the impact of methane-producing organisms in the gut microbiome to treat an underlying
cause of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), and (2) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to protect the gut
microbiome from the effects of certain commonly used intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics for the prevention of  C. difficile 
infection (CDI), antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In collaboration with
Intrexon Corporation ( Intrexon ), we are also developing preclinical stage monoclonal antibody therapies for the prevention
and treatment of pertussis, and novel discovery stage biotherapeutics for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU).

All of our programs are supported by our
growing intellectual property portfolio. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: filing new patent applications;
prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. In total, we hold approximately
120 U.S. and foreign patents and have over 65 U.S. and foreign patents pending. 

Our Microbiome-Focused Pipeline  

Our IBS-C and CDI/AAD programs are focused
on protecting the healthy function of the gut microbiome, or gut flora, which is home to billions of microbial species and composed
of a natural balance of both  good  beneficial species and potentially  bad  pathogenic species. When the
natural balance or normal function of these microbial species is disrupted, a person s health can be compromised. 

SYN-010   Treatment
of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)   

SYN-010 is our proprietary, modified-release
formulation of lovastatin lactone that is intended to reduce methane production by certain microorganisms ( M. smithii ) in
the gut while minimizing disruption to the microbiome. Methane produced by  M. smithii  is an underlying cause of pain, bloating
and constipation associated with IBS-C, and published reports have associated higher intestinal methane production with increased
constipation severity in IBS-C patients. SYN-010 is intended to act primarily in the intestinal lumen while avoiding systemic absorption,
thereby targeting the major cause of IBS-C, not just the patient s symptoms. 

In December 2013, through our subsidiary
Synthetic Biomics, Inc. (SYN Biomics), we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
(CSMC) and acquired the rights to develop products for therapeutic and prophylactic treatments of acute and chronic diseases, including
the development of SYN-010 to target IBS-C. We licensed from CSMC a portfolio of intellectual property comprised of several U.S.
and foreign patents and pending patent applications for various fields of use, including IBS-C, obesity and diabetes. An investigational
team led by Mark Pimentel, M.D. at CSMC discovered that these products may reduce the production of methane gas by certain GI microorganisms. 

We believe SYN-010 may reduce the impact
of methane producing organisms on IBS-C. 

Irritable Bowel Syndrome  

IBS is a functional GI disorder characterized
by gas, abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea or constipation, or alternating episodes of both. The illness affects both men and
women; however, two-thirds of diagnosed sufferers are women. The onset of IBS can begin anytime from adolescence to adulthood.
Four bowel patterns may be seen with IBS including: IBS-C (constipation predominant), IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), IBS-M (mixed
diarrhea and constipation) and IBS-U (unsubtyped). According to GlobalData s IBS Global Drug Forecast and Market Analysis
to 2023 (December 2014) stringent disease diagnosis criteria to ensure market relevance and a population most likely to receive
a diagnosis and prescription drug treatment, the prevalence of IBS in adults in the United States, Europe and Japan was expected
to be 41.1 million in 2015, and it has been reported that up to 20 percent of all IBS patients have IBS-C. 

Extensive studies conducted by Dr. Pimentel
and collaborators have shown that overproduction of methane gas is directly associated with bloating, pain and constipation in
IBS-C patients. Investigators at CSMC have discovered that inhibiting intestinal methane production may reverse constipation associated
with IBS-C, and may be beneficial in treating other major diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. 

Limitations of Current Treatments and
Market Opportunity  

Currently,
the FDA approved therapies for the treatment of IBS-C and other treatments including prescription and over-the-counter laxatives,
which provide patients with temporary symptomatic relief and often cause diarrhea, but do not treat the underlying cause of pain,
bloating and constipation associated with IBS-C. According to GlobalData, IBS   Global Drug Forecast and Market
Analysis to 2023 (December 2014), the estimated global sales for IBS therapeutics for 2015 was $669.3 million, and global sales
are expected to be greater than $1.5 billion in 2023.  

Overview of our 2 Phase 2 Clinical Trials  

In 2015 and 2016, we reported supportive data from our two SYN-010 Phase 2 trials, the first was comprised of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study
comparing SYN-010 21 mg and 42 mg dose strengths to placebo (Study 1), followed by an open-label study in which eligible patients
who completed Study 1 received SYN-010 42 mg for an additional 8 weeks (Study 2). The two Phase 2 SYN-010 clinical trials evaluated
the change from baseline (Day 1 of Study 1) in breath methane, stool frequency and abdominal pain and bloating at the end of weeks
1, 4, 8 and 12 (Study 2   Day 84) in patients diagnosed with IBS-C and with breath methane levels greater than 10 parts per
million (ppm) at screening. 

First Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results (4 Week Placebo-Controlled Acute Study)  

In December 2015, we reported supportive topline results from our first Phase 2 placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of SYN-010, including lowered breath methane
and improved stool frequency in patients with IBS-C. This first Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in June 2015 and enrolled
63 patients who were randomized using a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups, including two different SYN-010 dose groups (21 mg
and 42 mg) and a placebo group. Patients received single oral doses of SYN-010 or a placebo each day for 28 days. The primary objective
of this clinical trial was to evaluate the change from baseline in the area under the curve (AUC) of breath methane, as determined
by a lactulose breath test, in methane-positive patients with IBS-C after seven days of treatment with one of two dose levels of
SYN-010 as compared with a placebo. The trial s secondary endpoints included improvement in the number of complete spontaneous
bowel movements (CSBM) per week, and improvement in abdominal pain and bloating per standard scales required per FDA guidance.
There were no serious adverse events observed. 

In the first Phase 2 clinical trial of
SYN-010, plasma trough levels of lovastatin species were low and variable, such that  50% of patients had undetectable plasma
levels of each lovastatin analyte at days 7 and 28. In the few patients with detectable trough levels at day 28, concentrations
of both lovastatin lactone and lovastatin beta-hydroxyacid were significantly lower than those reported in published studies of
commercial lovastatin formulations. Modest reductions from baseline in mean cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides were observed
after 7 days of SYN-010 treatment; however, changes were not different between SYN-010 and Placebo at Day 28 and were not evident
after 12 weeks (Day 84). No significant changes in mean ALT or creatine kinase were observed in these patients. Changes in cholesterol,
LDL-C, and triglycerides did not correlate with SYN-010 dose, or with changes in body weight, changes in breath methane, or plasma
trough levels of either lovastatin lactone or lovastatin  -hydroxyacid. 

Second Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results (8 Week Open-Label Extension Study)  

In January 2016, we reported supportive topline
data from our second Phase 2 clinical trial of SYN-010, which was initiated in October 2015. As the patients completed the first
Phase 2 clinical trial, they were eligible to immediately rollover into the second Phase 2 clinical trial (multi-center, open-label)
of SYN-010 that evaluated the sustainability of the effect of one dose strength of SYN-010 (42 mg) on breath methane production
in 54 breath methane-positive patients with IBS-C, as well as key clinical outcomes, including frequency of CSBM, abdominal pain
and bloating. 

Patients in the second Phase 2 clinical trial
reported compliance with the daily SYN-010 dosing regimen such that all patients in the second Phase 2 clinical trial received
a minimum of 8 weeks treatment with SYN-010 42 mg. Patients who completed the second Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a statistically
significant decrease in methane production (p=0.002) from the beginning of the first Phase 2 clinical trial (Baseline, Day 1, prior
to any drug administration in the randomized study) to the end of the second Phase 2 clinical trial (12 weeks, Day 84), thus meeting
the clinical trial's primary endpoint. Topline data from the second Phase 2 clinical trial also showed improvements in secondary
efficacy endpoints, including: (1) a statistically significant reduction in the mean IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS; p 0.0001),
which includes abdominal pain, bloating, stool frequency and quality of life scores, for all patients from the first Phase 2 clinical
trial baseline to the end of the second Phase 2 clinical trial, and (2) an increase in the percentage of patients identified as
Monthly Responders, an FDA-defined composite measure incorporating improvements in CSBMs and abdominal pain. 

Daily doses of SYN-010 were well-tolerated
by IBS-C patients over the combined 12 weeks of the Phase 2a clinical trials (at least 8 weeks of SYN-010 42 mg). No serious adverse
events were observed and there were no incidences of drug-related diarrhea. 

DDW 2016 Presentation   

In May 2016, we presented detailed data
supporting previously reported supportive topline data from two Phase 2 clinical trials of two dose strengths of SYN-010 at DDW2016. 

Clinical data from the 57 patients who
completed Study 1 and 54 patients who completed Study 2 showed clinically meaningful improvements in measurable endpoints, including: 

Data from Study 1 demonstrating that three times as many patients in the placebo group took rescue medication
compared to patients on either the 21 mg or 42 mg dose strength of SYN-010.   

Data from all patients who participated in both Study 1 and Study 2 and who were administered the 42 mg dose strength of SYN-010 for at least eight weeks demonstrated an inverse correlation (p=0.0259) between breath methane AUC and complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM). A similar inverse correlation (p=0.0028) was observed between breath methane AUC and spontaneous bowel movements (SBM).   

Data demonstrating the 42 mg dose strength of SYN-010 had a similar overall drug response rate to comparable FDA approved and clinical stage therapies for the treatment of IBS-C with a significantly lower rate of diarrhea in study participants.   

Data demonstrating clear improvements in abdominal pain, bloating and quality of life measures (IBS-SSS) in participants who were administered SYN-010.   

Clinical Pharmacokinetic Study    

In May 2016, we reported results from a separate completed randomized, open-label clinical study of healthy
volunteers which evaluated the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the active ingredient of SYN-010. The PK data in healthy volunteers
supported the modified-release profile of SYN-010, which is designed to avoid drug release in the stomach and deliver the antimethanogenic
drug form, lovastatin lactone, into the lower small intestine and colon while reducing systemic exposure to the cholesterol-lowering
lovastatin beta-hydroxyacid metabolite. Lovastatin lactone concentrations in stool samples from these healthy volunteers were equivalent
to concentrations that caused 90% inhibition of methane production by stool samples from IBS-C patients in vitro. Consistent with
the Phase 2a studies in IBS-C patients, data reported from this study demonstrate that the administration of SYN-010 21 mg and
42 mg did not result in adverse changes to the lipid profiles of study participants. 

Recent Developments and Phase 3 Planning  

On July 20, 2016, we participated in an
End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. Following a review of data from the two Phase 2 clinical trials of SYN-010 conducted by us,
a collaborative and positive discussion ensued with the FDA to determine the optimal pathway to advance SYN-010 into Phase 3 development.
In accordance with guidance from the FDA, we plan to conduct a Phase 2b/3 adaptive design study for our first pivotal trial of
SYN-010. In addition to IBS-C patients who present with high breath methane levels, further dose exploration will evaluate the
potential efficacy of SYN-010 in IBS-C patients who may have low breath methane levels. We have submitted a study protocol design
and corresponding statistical analysis plan to the FDA and are awaiting feedback on the protocol design from the FDA. The proposed
Phase 2b/3 study design anticipates enrolling approximately 840 patients to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment
groups, including two different SYN-010 dose groups (21 mg and 42 mg) and a placebo group. Breath methane levels at screening will
be used to ensure each treatment group has approximately the same ratio of high and low breath methane subjects. We anticipate
initiating this clinical trial during the first quarter of 2017. 

Anticipated Regulatory Strategy  

We believe that we will be able to utilize
the regulatory approval pathway provided in Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for SYN-010.
A New Drug Application (NDA) submitted under Section 505(b)(2), referred to as a 505(b)(2) NDA, contains full safety and efficacy
reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as safety and efficacy information on the
active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right
of reference. We believe we can rely in part on the FDA s previous findings of safety for Mevacor in published clinical
data. We expect to rely on published clinical trials using Mevacor to provide support of efficacy. 

Intellectual Property  

The SYN-010 intellectual property portfolio
includes approximately 60 issued U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 20 U.S. and foreign patents pending. 

SYN-004 (ribaxamase)   Prevention
of C. difficile infections (CDI) and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD)   

SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is an oral prophylactic
therapy designed to degrade certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics within the GI tract and maintain the natural balance of the gut
microbiome for the prevention of CDI, AAD and emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Beta-lactam antibiotics are a mainstay
in hospital infection management and include the commonly used penicillin and cephalosporin classes of antibiotics. 

In November 2012, we acquired a series
of oral beta-lactamase enzymes (P1A, P2A and P3A) and related assets targeting the prevention of CDI, the leading healthcare-associated
infection that generally occurs secondary to treatment with IV antibiotics from Prev ABR LLC. The acquired assets include a pre-Investigation
New Drug (IND) package for P3A (which we now refer to as ribaxamase, formerly SYN-004), Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data for P1A,
manufacturing processes and data, and a portfolio of issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents intended to support an IND and
Biologics License Application (BLA) with the FDA. Utilizing this portfolio of assets, we developed a proprietary, second generation
oral beta-lactamase enzyme product candidate that we call ribaxamase. 

Compared to the first generation oral enzyme
candidate of P1A, we believe that the second generation candidate, SYN-004 (ribaxamase), will have activity against a broader spectrum
of beta-lactam antibiotics, including both penicillins and certain cephalosporins. Due to the structural similarities between P1A
and SYN-004 (ribaxamase), and based on previous discussions with the FDA, certain preclinical data collected on P1A was used in
support of an IND application for our new product candidate, SYN-004 (ribaxamase). P1A was evaluated in four Phase 1 and one Phase
2 clinical trials conducted in Europe. In total, 112 patients and 143 healthy normal subjects participated in these studies. 

Beta-lactamase enzymes have the ability
to degrade beta-lactam antibiotics that may be excreted into the Gastro Intestinal tract (GI tract). P1A (the first generation
candidate) showed acceptable safety and tolerability in a Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition, data from two Phase 2 clinical trials
demonstrated that P1A had the ability to preserve GI microflora in hospitalized patients treated with IV ampicillin or the combination
of piperacillin and tazobactam. 

C. difficile  

C.  difficile  is the leading type
of hospital acquired infection and is frequently associated with IV beta-lactam antibiotic treatment. According to an article published
in the New England Journal of Medicine (Leffler DA et al. N Engl J Med 2015; 372: 1539-1548), CDIs more than quadruple the cost
of hospitalizations, increasing annual expenditures by approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. CDI is a rising global hospital acquired
infection (HAI) problem in which the toxins produced by  C. difficile  bacteria result in AAD, and in the most serious cases,
pseudomembranous colitis (severe inflammation of the lower GI tract) that can lead to death. The CDC identified  C. difficile 
as an  urgent public health threat,  particularly given its resistance to many drugs used to treat other infections.
CDI is a major, unintended risk associated with the prophylactic or therapeutic use of IV antibiotics, which may alter the natural
balance of microflora that normally protect the GI tract, leading to  C. difficile  overgrowth and infection. Other risk factors
for CDI include hospitalization, prolonged length of stay, underlying illness, immune-compromising conditions including the administration
of chemotherapy and advanced age. In addition, approximately 25% of patients experience a recurrence of CDI within one to three
months. 

Limitations of Current Treatments and
Market Opportunity  

CDI is a widespread and often drug resistant
infectious disease. According to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Leffler DA et al. N Engl J Med 2015;
372:1539-1548), it is estimated that 453,000 patients are infected with  C. difficile  annually in the U.S., and it has been
reported that approximately 29,000 patients die due to a CDI each year. CDI has surpassed methicillin-resistant staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) as the most frequent hospital acquired infection. Controlling the spread of CDI has proven challenging, as the  C.
difficile  spores are easily transferred to patients via normal contact with healthcare personnel and with inanimate objects.
There is currently no vaccine or approved product for the prevention of CDI. 

According to IMS Health Incorporated, each
year 24 million unique patients are administered some form of IV antibiotic in the U.S. which may contribute to the onset of CDI*.
Additional data that we requisitioned suggests SYN-004 s (ribaxamase s) significant target market is represented by
the 117 million average days SYN-004 (ribaxamase) could be administered with target IV beta-lactam antibiotics to the 16.7 million
hospitalized patients each year, which at a price point of $100 per day indicates a potential market size of approximately $12.0
billion. This estimate is based upon data that we requisitioned and derived from the following report: Arlington Medical Resources
(AMR), a Decision Resources Group Company, 2014 Audits of Acute Care Hospital Antibiotic Utilization. Currently there are no approved
treatments designed to protect the gut microbiome from the damaging effects of IV antibiotics. We believe SYN-004 s ability
to degrade certain beta-lactam antibiotics will be consistent with, or more effective than results previously demonstrated by PIA,
SYN-004 s predecessor, in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies conducted by IPSAT. In previously reported clinical studies, SYN-004
(ribaxamase) demonstrated greater efficacy in degrading certain cephalosporins (ceftriaxone) compared to its predecessor, PIA.
The worldwide market for SYN-004 (ribaxamase) could represent a multi-billion dollar opportunity for us.

Phase 1a and 1b Clinical Trial Pharmacokinetic
Data  

In March 2015, we reported supportive pharmacokinetic
data from our Phase 1a and 1b clinical trials, which suggests that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) may have no effect on the IV antibiotic
in the bloodstream, allowing the antibiotic to fight the primary infection. In February 2015, we reported supportive topline results
from our Phase 1b clinical trial of escalating doses of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase), with no safety or tolerability issues reported
at dose levels and dose regimens both meeting and exceeding those expected to be studied in upcoming clinical trials. The Phase
1a (40 participants) and 1b (24 participants) clinical trials of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) were initiated in December 2014. 

First Phase 2a Clinical Trial Topline
Results  

In December 2015, we reported supportive
topline results from our Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), including data from ten ileostomized participants that
demonstrated SYN-004 (ribaxamase) successfully degraded residual IV ceftriaxone in the chyme (digestive fluid in the small intestine)
without affecting the intended level of ceftriaxone in the bloodstream. This Phase 2a clinical trial was initiated in March 2015
to evaluate the GI antibiotic-degrading effects and the safety of SYN-004 (ribaxamase). 

Second Phase 2a Clinical Trial Topline
Results  

In June 2015, we initiated a second Phase
2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) to evaluate the GI antibiotic-degrading ability and the safety of SYN-004 (ribaxamase),
in the presence of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI), esomeprazole, in healthy participants with functioning ileostomies. 

In May 2016, we reported supportive topline
results from our second Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), including data demonstrating the 150 mg dose of SYN-004
(ribaxamase), both alone and in the presence of the proton pump inhibiter (PPI), esomeprazole, degraded residual IV ceftriaxone
to levels that were low or not detectable in the intestinal chyme (digestive fluid in the small intestine) of 14 healthy participants
with functioning ileostomies. In addition, ceftriaxone plasma concentrations in study participants were very similar in the presence
or absence of an oral PPI, suggesting limited drug-drug interactions with esomeprazole. The 150 mg dose strength of SYN-004 (ribaxamase)
was well tolerated by all participants in this clinical trial.  

Data from an additional study conducted in humanized pigs
demonstrated that when administered with ceftriaxone, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) prevented ceftriaxone-remediated changes in the pig
fecal microflora, protecting the microbiome from antibiotic-mediated damage when compared to pigs who only received ceftriaxone. 

Phase 2b Clinical Trial Design / Phase 3 Planning  

In September 2015, we initiated a randomized placebo-controlled
Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial intended to evaluate the ability of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) to prevent CDI,  C. difficile 
associated diarrhea (CDAD) and AAD in patients hospitalized for a lower respiratory tract infection and receiving IV ceftriaxone.
A planned interim analysis was triggered and conducted following the enrollment of approximately 80% of the planned patients who
also completed the follow-up period outlined in the study protocol.  In September 2016, and  following
a closed session with the independent Interim Analysis Committee (IAC) in which we remained blinded to the study data, a recommendation
was given by the IAC to continue the study per protocol without modification, indicating that the study was adequately powered
and should continue as planned. No safety issues were identified by the IAC during the interim analysis.  Based upon the
recommendation by the IAC, we completed enrollment in this trial with 413 patients exceeding the desired sample size of 372 patients.
An exploratory endpoint will be to evaluate the ability of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) to limit disruption of the gut microbiome diversity,
also known as dysbiosis. We expect announcing top-line results from our Phase 2b clinical trial during the first quarter of 2017.
In 2017, we also plan to enter into strategic discussions with the CDC, hold an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, and expect
to initiate Phase 3 trial(s) towards the latter part of the year. 

Recent Developments  

In September 2016, we completed enrollment
in our Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial intended to evaluate the ability of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) to prevent CDI,  C.
difficile  associated diarrhea (CDAD) and AAD in patients hospitalized for a lower respiratory tract infection and receiving
IV ceftriaxone 

On October 6, 2016, we announced the
award of a government contract by the CDC s  Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)
2016-N-17812 . The contract amount is up to $521,014. The award will support research conducted during our ongoing,
randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical study of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and the CDCs  
efforts to assess how selective pressure from IV antibiotics may lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the gut
microbiome. The funding will also support research to evaluate SYN-004 s (ribaxamase's) ability to reduce selective
pressure associated with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms in the gut microbiomes of patients enrolled in our
Phase 2b clinical trial. We will examine DNA isolated from longitudinal samples obtained during the clinical trial and look
for changes to the patient's gut resistome, specifically examining for alterations in the presence and/or abundance of
antibiotic resistance genes.  

SYN-007   Prevention
of CDI and AAD   

Preclinical work is ongoing to determine
the ability of SYN-007 to protect the gut microbiome and degrade oral beta-lactam antibiotics. SYN-007 comprises a reformulated
version of SYN-004 for use with oral beta-lactam antibiotics versus IV beta-lactam antibiotics. 

SYN-006   Prevention
of CDI and AAD   

The development of SYN-006 is in the discovery
stage. SYN-006 is intended to be an oral prophylactic therapy designed to degrade IV carbapenem antibiotics (a third class of beta-lactam
antibiotics) within the GI tract and maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome for the prevention of CDI and AAD. While
SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is intended to degrade penicillin and certain cephalosporins in the GI tract, the SYN-006 discovery program
has the potential to expand the activity to a broader spectrum of IV beta-lactam antibiotics in the GI tract to include carbapenem
antibiotics. 

C. difficile: Intellectual Property  

The SYN-004 (ribaxamase) intellectual
property portfolio includes approximately 60 issued U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 25 U.S. and foreign patents pending. 

Research Programs    

Infectious disease outbreaks are increasing
while intervention options are declining due to widespread multidrug-resistant bacteria, increasing numbers of immuno-compromised
patients (e.g., the elderly and cancer patients) and the isolation of new pathogens. 

Monoclonal Antibodies for Infectious
Diseases  

Antibodies are proteins, generally found
in the bloodstream, that provide immunity in detecting and destroying pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria and their associated
toxins. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can also be designed and produced as therapeutic agents, utilizing protein engineering and
recombinant production technologies. The mAbs being developed under our collaboration with Intrexon are intended to supplement
a patient s own immune system by providing the means to specifically and rapidly neutralize and/or clear specific pathogens
and toxins of interest in a process known as  passive immunity.  Many pathogens that cause infectious diseases are
innately resistant to, or over time have developed increased resistance to, antibiotics and other drugs. 

SYN-005   Pertussis
(Whooping Cough)   

Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) 
is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the upper respiratory tract, causing uncontrollable and violent coughing. Antibiotic
treatment does not have a major effect on the course of pertussis. While such treatment can eliminate the  B. pertussis  bacteria
from the respiratory tract, it does not neutralize the pertussis toxin. Infants with pertussis often require hospitalization in
pediatric intensive care units, frequently requiring mechanical ventilation. Pertussis in adults generally leads to a chronic cough
referred to as the  cough of 100 days.  The incidence of pertussis is increasing due to the declining effectiveness
of the acellular vaccine introduced in the 1990s, exposure of unvaccinated and under-vaccinated individuals including infants who
are not yet fully vaccinated and exposure of individuals whose immunity has diminished over time. 

According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), there are 50 million cases of whooping cough, and it is estimated that  B. pertussis  infection causes up to 300,000
deaths each year worldwide, primarily among unvaccinated infants. Recent news reports throughout the U.S. indicate that the pertussis
vaccine introduced in the 1990s does not provide long-term protection and, as a result, whooping cough cases have increased to
a 60-year high. 

Intrexon Collaboration and The University
of Texas at Austin Agreement  

In August 2012, we entered into a worldwide
exclusive channel collaboration with Intrexon through which we intend to develop mAb therapies for the treatment of certain infectious
diseases not adequately addressed by existing therapies. In December 2012, we initiated mAb development for the prevention and
treatment of pertussis focusing on toxin neutralization. Unlike antibiotics, we are developing a mAb therapy to target and neutralize
the pertussis toxin as a prophylaxis for high-risk newborns and in order to reduce the mortality rate in infected infants. This
program intends to utilize Intrexon s comprehensive suite of proprietary technologies, including the mAbLogix  TM 
platform for rapid discovery of fully human mAbs and the LEAP    cell processing station. 

To further the development of this potential
therapy for pertussis, we entered into an agreement with UT Austin to license the rights to certain research and pending patents
related to pertussis antibodies. These research efforts are being conducted at the Cockrell School of Engineering in the laboratory
of Associate Professor, Jennifer A. Maynard, Ph.D., the Laurence E. McMakin, Jr. Centennial Faculty Fellow in the McKetta Department
of Chemical Engineering. Dr. Maynard brings to the project her expertise in defining the key neutralizing epitopes of pertussis
toxin to optimize the potential efficacy of antibody therapeutics. 

Preclinical and Clinical Development  

Working with our collaborator, Intrexon,
and our academic collaborator, UT Austin, we have established a humanized mAb product candidate, SYN-005, designed to neutralize
pertussis toxin, a major cause of pertussis-mediated infant morbidity and mortality. The two humanized mAbs, hu1B7 and hu11E6,
bound tightly to the toxin and potently neutralized the toxin. In addition, the antibodies, individually or in combination, were
highly efficacious in a murine model of pertussis in which they completely mitigated elevations of the white blood cell count that
is characteristic of the illness. The antibodies, alone and in combination, were more potent that P-IVIG, a polyclonal IgG preparation
previously used in human clinical trials. 

In April 2014, and again in September 2014,
we received positive preclinical research findings of SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis in three non-human primate studies
(n = 19). In the latter two pertussis studies in particular, SYN-005 rapidly stopped the rise in white blood cell count that is
characteristic of the disease and accelerated its return to baseline. 

In September 2014, we received U.S. Orphan
Drug Designation from the FDA for SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis. 

In April 2015, preclinical efficacy data
that support advancing SYN-005 toward clinical trials were presented in two poster presentations at the European Congress of Clinical
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases meeting (ECCMID) 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The data suggest that SYN-005 has therapeutic
potential to diminish morbidity, long-term complications and mortality from pertussis in critically ill infants. In addition, the
data support a prophylactic approach for use in newborns that has the potential to save thousands of lives annually, particularly
in the developing world where the unmet need is greatest. 

In October 2015, the Bill   Melinda
Gates Foundation awarded a grant to UT Austin to generate preclinical proof-of-concept data in the neonatal non-human primate model
to test the hypothesis that antibody administration at birth may have a role in the prevention of pertussis. 

In December 2015, the non-human primate
prophylaxis study was initiated by UT Austin to evaluate the potential of our monoclonal antibody, 1B7, in the prevention of pertussis.
This preclinical study is expected to provide support for the use of our 1B7 in potential clinical application. 

Intellectual Property  

We have patents pending on compositions
and uses of SYN-005 and we have two issued U.S. patent and five patents pending on other pertussis mAbs from UT Austin. 

SYN-200   Treatment
of Phenylketonuria (PKU)   

PKU is a genetic disease that begins at
birth characterized by a deficiency in the liver enzyme that breaks down the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), a building
block of proteins normally obtained through the foods we eat. As a result, Phe accumulates in the body, becoming toxic and leading
to serious health consequences, including profound mental retardation, brain damage, mental illness, behavioral problems, seizures,
tremors, limited cognitive ability and hyperactivity. If left untreated, the most severe form of PKU leads to permanent cognitive
damage. PKU affects more than 14,000 people in the U.S. and 50,000 people in developed nations globally. There is no existing cure
for PKU, requiring patients to maintain a life-long treatment program and a carefully controlled diet. 

Intrexon Collaboration  

In August 2015, we initiated the SYN-200
discovery program for development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for the treatment of patients with PKU pursuant
to an exclusive channel collaboration with Intrexon. We intend to utilize Intrexon s ActoBiotics platform to provide a proprietary
method of delivering therapeutic protein and peptides to the GI tract through food-grade microbes. This program is in the discovery
stage. 

SYN-020   Oral Intestinal
Alkaline Phosphatase   

SYN-020 is in the preclinical development stage. SYN-020 is being developed as a modified-release oral
dosage form of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP). Published preclinical and clinical studies on IAP indicate that an oral IAP
product may have efficacy in a broad range of significant therapeutic indications including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel
disease, microbial dysbiosis and metabolic syndrome. We have identified cell systems in which IAP can be expressed and are pursuing
manufacture of material for evaluation in selected preclinical disease models. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require
the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods
presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due
to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to
these balances in future periods. The critical accounting estimates that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements
and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described under Part II, Item 7 of our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30,
2016 and 2015   

General and Administrative Expenses  

General and administrative expenses increased
by 30% to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015.  This increase is primarily the result of increased stock-based compensation, investor relations expenses and employee
salaries and benefits costs offset by lower consulting and legal expenses. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense
was $524,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $387,000 the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Research and Development Expenses  

Research and development expenses decreased
by 30% to $7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $10.0 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015. This decrease is primarily the result of charges related to our Exclusive Channel Collaboration (ECC) agreement with Intrexon
that was entered into in August 2015. In 2015, we issued 937,500 shares of our common stock to Intrexon as payment of the technology
access fee that resulted in a non-cash charge of $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development
expenses also include a charge related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $422,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to $259,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

The following table sets forth our research
and development expenses directly related to our therapeutic areas for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These
direct expenses were external costs associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials. Indirect research and development
expenses related to employee costs, facilities, stock-based compensation and research and development support services that are
not directly allocated to specific drug candidates. 

Other Income (Expense ) 

Other income was $0.7 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to other income of $4.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is due to non-cash income of $0.7 million from the
change in fair value of warrants. The decrease in the fair value of the warrants was due to the decrease in our stock price
from the prior quarter. Non-cash income related to the decrease of fair value of warrants for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 was $4.1 million. 

Net Loss  

Our net loss was $8.5 million,
or $0.09 per basic and dilutive common share for the three months ended September 30,
2016, compared to a net loss of $7.5 million, or $0.08 per basic common share and $0.12 per dilutive common share for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
and 2015   

General and Administrative Expenses  

General and administrative expenses increased
to $6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
This increase of 20% is primarily the result of increased employee costs associated with the transition of the administrative and
financial office to our Maryland headquarters, and an increase in stock-based compensation offset by lower consulting services
and investor relations expense. The charge relating to stock-based compensation expense was $1.7 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Research and Development Expenses  

Research
and development expenses decreased to $22.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $24.0 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease of 7% is primarily the result of increased program costs associated with clinical
development programs and research activities within our pathogen-specific microbiome-focused pipeline, including our  C. difficile, 
IBS-C and Pertussis     programs offset by a decrease in
manufacturing costs along with the milestone paid to Prev ABR in April 2015 and the ECC entered into with Intrexon in August 2015
that resulted in a non-cash charge of $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $1.0 million expense for achieving the third milestone as set forth in
the Asset Purchase Agreement with Prev ABR LLC, dated November 28, 2012. Prev ABR LLC exercised its option to receive the milestone
payment in shares of our common stock that were issued in April 2015. In August 2015, we entered an ECC with Intrexon where we
issued 937,500 shares of our common stock to Intrexon as payment of the technology access fee that resulted in a non-cash charge
of $3.0 million. Research and development expenses also include a charge relating to non-cash stock-based compensation expense
of $1,231,000 for the nine months ended September, 2016, compared to $757,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

The following table sets forth our research
and development expenses directly related to our therapeutic areas for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. These
direct expenses were external costs associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials. Indirect research and development
expenses related to employee costs, facilities, stock-based compensation and research and development support services that are
not directly allocated to specific drug candidates. 

Other Income (Expense)  

Other income was $3.7 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to other expense of $3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Other
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to non-cash income of $3.7 million from the change in fair
value of warrants. The decrease in the fair value of the warrants was due to the decrease in our stock price from the year ended
December 31, 2015. Non-cash expense related to the change in the fair value of warrants for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 was $3.9 million. 

Net Loss  

Our net loss was $25.3 million, or $0.27
per basic and dilutive common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss
of $33.5 million, or $0.42 per basic and dilutive common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

With the exception of the three months
ended June 30, 2010, we have experienced significant losses since inception and have a significant accumulated deficit. To date,
we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of our common stock, and we expect to continue to seek
to obtain the required capital in a similar manner. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $169.7 million as of September 30,
2016. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis, if at all, obtain the
required funding to achieve our current business plan, obtain the required regulatory approvals for our product candidates or complete
additional corporate partnering or acquisition transactions in order to commercialize such product candidates once regulatory approval
is received. 

Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.5
million as of September 30, 2016, a decrease of $16.3 million from December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the primary use of cash was for working capital requirements and operating activities which resulted in a net loss of
$25.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Our continued operations as currently planned
will primarily depend on our ability to raise additional capital from various sources, including equity (the FBR Sales Agreement
as well as other equity sources) and debt financings, as well as, license fees from potential corporate partners, joint ventures
and grant funding. Although we have been awarded a contract by the CDC s  Broad Agency Announcement
(BAA) 2016-N-17812, the amount of the award will not be sufficient to enable us to complete our clinical trials as planned and
therefore we will be required to obtain additional capital.  Such additional funds may not become available on acceptable
terms or at all and there can be no assurance that any additional funding that we do obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs.
We will continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through the similar sources of capital previously described. We can give
no assurance that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs. 

Current and Future Financing Needs  

We have incurred an accumulated deficit
of $169.7 million through September 30, 2016. With the exception of the quarter ended June 30, 2010, we have incurred negative
cash flow from operations since our inception. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, a substantial amount of funds in
connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development efforts, our clinical trials and
our research and discovery efforts. 

On August 5, 2016, we entered into an
At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with FBR Capital Markets   Co. ( the FBR Sales Agreement ), which enables
us to offer and sell shares of our common stock with aggregate common stock sales of up to $40.0 million, from time to
time through FBR Capital Markets   Co. as our sales agent. Sales of common stock under the FBR Sales Agreement are made
in sales deemed to be  at-the-market  equity offerings as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities
Act. FBR Capital Markets   Co. is entitled to receive a commission rate of up to 3.0% of gross sales in connection with
the sale of our common stock sold on our behalf. From August 11, 2016 through September 30, 2016, we sold through the FBR
Sales Agreement an aggregate of 380,265 shares of the Company's common stock, and received gross proceeds of
approximately $650,000, before deducting issuance expenses. Subsequent to quarter end, we have sold approximately
520,000 shares of the Company s common stock, and received gross proceeds of approximately $900,000. 

Based on our current plans, our cash and cash
equivalents will not be sufficient to enable us to meet our near term expected plans. Our notes to financial statements contain
an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring and continuing losses from operations and expressing substantial doubt in our
ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available.  We will be required to obtain additional
funding in order to continue the development of our current product candidates and to continue to fund operations at the current
cash expenditure levels, although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital. Potential
sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our equity (including through the FBR Sales Agreement
that we entered into with FBR Capital Markets   Co. in August 2016) or debt and other sources. We cannot assure that we will
meet the requirements for use of the FBR Sales Agreement or that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, or at
all. If we fail to obtain additional funding in the next few months and otherwise in the future when needed, we will not be able
to execute our business plan as planned and will be forced to cease certain development activities until funding is received and
our business will suffer, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows. 

The actual amount of funds we will need
to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following: 

the
progress of our research activities;  

the number and scope of our research programs;   

the progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities;   

the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into research and development agreements;   

our ability to maintain current research and development licensing arrangements and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements;   

our ability to achieve our milestones under licensing arrangements;   

the costs associated with manufacturing-related services to produce material for use in our clinical trials;   

the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and   

the costs and timing of regulatory approvals.   

We have based our estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate. Potential
sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our shares (including through the FBR Sales Agreement,
if we meet the conditions for sale thereunder) or debt and other sources. Additionally, we may seek to access the public or private
equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. We do not have any committed sources of
financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be
acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into
common stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain financing when
needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations and our
business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we did not have, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules. 

Contractual Obligations  

There have been no material changes to
our contractual obligations during the period covered by this report from those disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

The primary objective of our investment
activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming
significant risk. Our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016, our cash
and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market securities. We do not engage in any hedging activities against changes
in interest rates. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, we would
not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market
interest rates or credit conditions on our securities portfolio. We may, however, require additional financing to fund future obligations
and no assurance can be given that the terms of future sources of financing will not expose us to material market risk. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The Company has adopted and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the
SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15,
the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, have concluded that based on such evaluation, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of
September 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or
submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There have not been any changes in our
internal controls over financial reporting during our quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

From time to time we may become involved
in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any
legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact
on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.  

The following information updates, and
should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  contained
in our 2015 Form 10-K. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2015
Form 10-K. 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS  

We will need to raise additional
capital to operate our business and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development
programs or commercialization efforts.   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our operating activities used net cash of approximately
$17.5 million and as of September 30, 2016 our cash and cash equivalents were $4.5 million. With the exception of the three months
ended June 30, 2010, we have experienced significant losses since inception and have a significant accumulated deficit. As of September
30, 2016, our accumulated deficit totaled approximately $169.7 million on a consolidated basis. We expect to incur additional
operating losses in the future and therefore expect our cumulative losses to increase. With the exception of the quarter ended
June 30, 2010, and limited laboratory revenues from Adeona Clinical Laboratory, which we sold in March 2012, we have generated
very minimal revenues. We do not expect to derive significant revenue from any source in the near future until we or our potential
partners successfully commercialize our products. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities,
particularly as we continue research and development, initiate and conduct clinical trials and seek marketing approval for our
product candidates. Until such time as we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates,
we will not be permitted to sell our products and therefore will not have product revenues from the sale of products. For the foreseeable
future we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from equity and debt offerings, cash on hand, licensing
fees and grants. Based upon our business plans, we do not believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
will be sufficient to sustain our operations as currently planned. Therefore, we will need to seek additional sources of funding,
such as additional financing or grant funding, and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If
we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, we will be unable to complete planned
preclinical and clinical trials, in the periods anticipated, if at all, or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA
and other regulatory authorities. In addition, if we do not raise additional capital in the next few months or otherwise in the
future when needed we will be forced to delay, discontinue or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing efforts,
and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance
of our equity or debt securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR STOCK  

We cannot assure you that the common
stock will be liquid or that it will remain listed on the NYSE MKT.   

Our common stock is listed on the NYSE
MKT. The NYSE MKT s listing standards generally mandate that we meet certain requirements relating to stockholders 
equity, market capitalization, aggregate market value of publicly held shares and distribution requirements. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to maintain the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT. The NYSE MKT requires companies to meet certain
continued listing criteria including a minimum stockholders  equity of $6.0 million if an issuer has sustained losses from
continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent years, as outlined in the NYSE MKT Exchange Company Guide. At September
30 2016, we had stockholders  deficit of ($5,976,089). The NYSE MKT Exchange Company Guide also states that the NYSE normally
will not consider removing from listing securities of an issuer with total value of market capitalization of at least $50.0 million
and 1,100,000 shares publicly held, a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15.0 million and 400 round lot shareholders.
Although the total value of our market capitalization exceeds $50.0 million and we have 1,100,000 shares publicly held, a market
value of publicly held shares of at least $15.0 million and 400 round lot shareholders, there can be no assurance that the NYSE
MKT will continue to list our common stock if we should fail to maintain the minimum stockholders  equity. In addition, in
the future we may not be able to maintain such minimum stockholders  equity and/or issue additional equity securities in
exchange for cash or other assets, if available, to maintain certain minimum stockholders  equity required by the NYSE MKT.
If we are delisted from the NYSE MKT then our common stock will trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as
the OTC Bulletin Board securities market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer market makers comply with quotation
requirements. In addition, delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price, substantially limit liquidity of our common
stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Delisting from the NYSE
MKT could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees, the loss of
institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. 

Our management team may invest or
spend the proceeds of our prior offerings and future offerings in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield
a significant return.   

Our management will have broad discretion
over the use of proceeds from our offerings. The net proceeds from our offerings, including sales made under the FBR Sales Agreement,
will be used primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, for clinical trials for our product
candidates, paying general and administrative expenses and accounts payable, increasing our working capital, funding research and
development and funding capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for licensing or acquiring intellectual
property to incorporate into our products and product candidates or our research and development programs and to in-license, acquire
or invest in complementary businesses or products, although we have no commitments or agreements with respect to any such licenses,
acquisitions or investments as of the date of this prospectus supplement. Our management will have considerable discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will not have the opportunity, as part of their investment decision, to assess whether
the proceeds are being used appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not increase our operating
results or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure of our management to use funds effectively could have a material
adverse effect on our business, cause the market price of our common stock to decline and impair the commercialization of our products
and/or delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities. These investments may not yield a favorable
return to our stockholders. 

The shares of common stock offered
under the FBR Sales Agreement may be sold in  at the market  offerings, and investors who buy shares at different times
will likely pay different prices.    

Investors who purchase shares that are
sold under the FBR Sales Agreement at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different outcomes
in their investment results. We will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices, and numbers of shares
sold, and there is no minimum or maximum sales price. Investors may experience declines in the value of their shares as a result
of share sales made at prices lower than the prices they paid.
