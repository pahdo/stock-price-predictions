WESTMORELAND COAL COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
   
  1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include accounts of Westmoreland Coal Company, or the Company, or Parent, and its subsidiaries and controlled entities including those of Westmoreland Resource Partners, LP ( WMLP ). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and require the use of management s estimates. The financial information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is unaudited, but reflects all adjustments which in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the periods shown. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The results of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
  These unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (   2015   Form 10-K ). 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15 - Statement of Cash Flows (Accounting Standards Codification, or  ASC,  Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which requires an entity to elect either the cumulative earnings approach or the nature of the distribution approach when determining the classification of cash inflows from equity method investments on the statement of cash flows. For our Activated Carbon 50/50 joint venture accounted for under the equity method of accounting, we have elected to use the nature of the distribution approach. Under this approach, distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital (e.g., a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture s sale of assets) in which case it is reported as an investing activity. The Company adopted this standard on September 30, 2016. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2016 and retrospectively applied the guidance to prior periods. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , issued as a new Topic, ASC Topic 606. The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-14, issued in August 2015, deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company can either adopt these standards retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ). The amendments in ASU 2016-02 require companies that lease assets to recognize on their balance sheets the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations generated by contracts longer than one year. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
   
  2.     ACQUISITION 
  Acquisition of San Juan 
  On January 31, 2016, Westmoreland San Juan, LLC ( WSJ ), a variable interest entity of the Company, acquired San Juan Coal Company ( SJCC ), which operates the San Juan mine in Farmington, New Mexico, and San Juan Transportation Company ( SJTC  and such transaction, the  San Juan Acquisition ) for a total cash purchase price of approximately   $125.3  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  
  WESTMORELAND COAL COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONT.) 

million  , subject to post-closing adjustments. The San Juan mine is the exclusive supplier of coal to the adjacent San Juan Generating Station ( SJGS ) under a coal supply agreement through 2022. The San Juan operations are included in the Company s Coal - U.S. segment. 
  WSJ financed the San Juan Acquisition principally with a   $125.0 million   loan from NM Capital Utility Corporation (the  San Juan Loan ), an affiliate of Public Service Company of New Mexico (one of the owners of SJGS). 
  The San Juan Acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting that requires the total purchase consideration to be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair value.  
  The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary pending the completion of various estimates. During the measurement period (which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date), additional assets or liabilities may be recognized if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets or liabilities as of that date. The preliminary allocation may be adjusted after obtaining additional information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions of previous estimates, and these adjustments may be significant. Certain estimates in the San Juan purchase price allocation are classified as Level 3 fair value estimates. 
  A preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration follows (in millions): 

Pro Forma Information 
  The following pro forma information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and assumes the San Juan Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma results have been prepared based on estimates and

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONT.) 

assumptions, which the Company believes are reasonable, however, they are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations had the acquisitions occurred on the dates indicated above, or of future results of operations.  

3.     VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company consolidated its   100%   owned WSJ subsidiary which is a variable interest entity ( VIE ). WSJ s classification as a VIE is due to another party having the potential right to receive WSJ s residual returns. The Company is the primary beneficiary because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact WSJ s economic performance. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the operating results, assets and liabilities of WSJ.  See   Note 2 -  Acquisition   and   Note 6 - Debt and Lines of Credit  . 
  The following table presents the carrying amounts, after eliminating the effect of intercompany transactions, included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are for the use of or are the obligation of WSJ (in thousands):    

4.     INVENTORIES

  The 8.75% senior secured notes mature on January 1, 2022 ( 8.75% Notes ) and pay interest semiannually on January 1 and July 1 of each year at a fixed 8.75% interest rate. The 8.75% Notes are a primary obligation of the Parent and are guaranteed by Westmoreland Energy LLC, Westmoreland Mining LLC and Westmoreland Resources, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (other than Absaloka Coal, LLC, Westmoreland Risk Management, Inc. and certain other immaterial subsidiaries), referred to as the  Guarantors.

  WCC Term Loan Facility

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONT.) 

San Juan Loan 
  We financed the San Juan Acquisition in part with the San Juan Loan, a senior secured   $125.0 million   term loan from NM Capital Utility Corporation, an affiliate of Public Service Company of New Mexico (one of the owners of SJGS). The San Juan Loan matures February 1, 2021 and pays interest and principal on a quarterly basis at an interest rate of (i)   7.25%   (the  Margin Rate ) plus (ii) (A) the LIBOR for a three month period plus (B) a statutory reserve rate, which such Margin Rate increases incrementally during each year of the San Juan Loan term. As of   September 30, 2016  , the cash interest rate is   8.01%  . It is a primary obligation of Westmoreland San Juan, LLC, is guaranteed by SJCC, and is secured by substantially all of SJCC s assets. The San Juan Loan has no prepayment penalties. The agreements governing the San Juan Loan include representations and warranties and covenants regarding the ownership and operation of SJCC and the properties acquired in the San Juan Acquisition and standard special purpose bankruptcy remote entity covenants designed to preserve the separateness from Westmoreland of each of (i) WSJ, (ii) its direct parent company, Westmoreland San Juan Holdings, Inc., (iii) SJCC and (iv) SJTC (collectively, the  Westmoreland San Juan Entities ). Obligations under the San Juan Loan are recourse only to the Westmoreland San Juan Entities and their assets Westmoreland nor its subsidiaries (other than the Westmoreland San Juan Entities) is an obligor under the San Juan Loan in any respect. The agreement governing the San Juan Loan requires that all revenues of the Westmoreland San Juan Entities, aside from payments on certain leases, are deposited into a cash management collection account swept monthly for operating expenses, capital expenditures, and loan payment and prepayment. The assets and credit of SJCC are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of the Company other than those of the Westmoreland San Juan Entities. 
  WMLP Term Loan Facility 
  The term loan of WMLP  matures in December 2018 ( WMLP Term Loan Facility ) and pays interest on a quarterly basis at a variable rate per annum equal to the LIBOR floor of (  0.75%  ) plus   8.5%   or the reference rate as defined in the financing agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the cash interest rate is   9.25%  . The WMLP Term Loan Facility is a primary obligation of Oxford Mining Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of WMLP, is guaranteed by WMLP and its subsidiaries, and is secured by substantially all of WMLP s and its subsidiaries  assets. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants of the WMLP Term Loan Facility. 
  The WMLP Term Loan Facility also provides for Paid In Kind Interest ( PIK Interest ) at a variable rate per annum between   1.00%   and   3.00%   based on our consolidated total net leverage ratio as defined in the financing agreement. The rate of PIK Interest is recalculated on a quarterly basis with the PIK Interest added quarterly to the then-outstanding principal amount of the term loan under the financing agreement. PIK Interest under the financing agreement was   $6.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The outstanding term loan amount represents the principal balance of   $291.0 million  , plus PIK Interest of   $13.7 million  . 
  WMLP Revolving Credit Facility 
  The WMLP revolving line of credit ( WMLP Revolving Credit Facility ) permits WMLP to borrow up to the aggregate principal amount of   $15.0 million   and also allows letters of credit in an aggregate outstanding amount of up to   $10.0 million  , which reduces availability under the WMLP revolving credit facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. At   September 30, 2016  , availability under the WMLP revolving credit facility was   $15.0 million  . The WMLP Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of December 31, 2017. We were in compliance with all covenant requirements of the WMLP Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. 
  Capital Lease Obligations 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company entered into   $10.0 million   of new capital leases. 
  WCC Revolving Credit Facility 
  The Company amended the terms of its revolving line of credit ( WCC Revolving Credit Facility ) on September 30, 2016 and October 12, 2016, respectively. The September 30 amendment clarified the terms  Canadian Fixed Charges  and  US Fixed Charges  to allocate scheduled cash interest payments and to remove the allocation schedule of cash interest payments under the term  Interest Expense.  The October 12 amendment (1) replaced the previous lender, Bank of the West, with a new lender, East West Bank, (2) amended Interest Expense to remove certain dividend payments, (3) revised the term  Required Lenders  to constitute all lenders when only two unaffiliated lenders are party to the revolving credit facility, (4) removed the requirement of the delivery of a social responsibility questionnaire in connection with a Permitted Acquisition, (5) allowed for any Lender to provide the Swing Line Lender one day s prior written notice prohibiting a US Swing Line Loan or Canadian Swing Line Loan, (6) removed Administrative Agent discretion on application of proceeds from the sale of Collateral, (7)

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONT.) 

adjusted Annual Projections reporting requirements to no longer require delivery of a balance sheet and (8) adjusted the waterfall treatment with respect to Proceeds of Collateral.  
  Under the WCC Revolving Credit Facility the Company has a total aggregate borrowing capacity of   $60.0 million   between June 15th and August 31st of each year, with an aggregate borrowing capacity of   $50.0 million   outside of these periods. The availability of the WCC Revolving Credit Facility consists of a   $30.0 million   sub-facility (  $35.0 million   with the seasonal increase) available to our U.S. borrowers and a   $20.0 million   sub-facility (  $25.0 million   with the seasonal increase) available to our Canadian borrowers. The facility may support an equal amount of letters of credit, with outstanding letter of credit balances reducing availability under the facility. At   September 30, 2016  , availability on the WCC Revolving Credit Facility was   $36.3 million   with an outstanding balance of   $13.7 million   supporting letters of credit and   nothing   drawn on the WCC Revolving Credit Facility.  The WCC Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of   December 31, 2018  . We were in compliance with all covenant requirements of the WCC Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    
  Due to the adoption of ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, debt issuance costs related to the Company s debt liabilities are now reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the notes. The adoption of this standard resulted in the reclassification of   $25.8 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs from the non-current asset, Other assets, to a reduction of Long-term debt, less current portion on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. 

7.     POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS AND PENSION    
  Postretirement Medical Benefits 
  The Company provides postretirement medical benefits to retired employees and their dependents as mandated by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 and pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.

The Company expects to make   $0.1 million   of contributions to its pension plans during the remainder of   2016  . 
   
  8.     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS    
  The Company has power purchase contracts at its Roanoke Valley Power Facility ( ROVA ) to manage exposure to power price fluctuations. These contracts cover the period from April 2014 to March 2019 and contracted power prices range from   $41.05   to   $55.20   per megawatt hour, with a weighted average contract price of   $44.00   over the remaining contract lives. The contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, and accordingly their fair value is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

9.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. For other fair value disclosures, see also   Note 5 -  Restricted Investments And Bond Collateral   and   Note 8 -  Derivative Instruments  . 
             
    Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
                
    Level 2, defined as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
     The table below sets forth, by level, the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value at   September 30, 2016  : 

Long-term debt fair value estimates are based on observed prices for securities with an active trading market when available (Level 2) and otherwise using discount rate estimates based on interest rates (Level 3). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company valued the WMLP Term Loan Facility and the San Juan Loan with Level 3 fair values. The estimated fair values of the Company s debt with fixed and variable interest rates are as follows: 

10.   INCOME TAX    
    
  For interim income tax reporting the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate and applies this effective tax rate to its year-to-date pre-tax (loss) income. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the U.S. and Canadian valuation allowances and the impact of the statutory rate change in Alberta, Canada. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the U.S. and Canadian valuation allowances and for the recognition of changes in the Company s net deferred tax assets due to the San Juan Acquisition. 
  As part of the San Juan Acquisition, the Company acquired   $48.5 million   in deferred tax liabilities. Changes in the acquiring company s deferred tax assets or liabilities subsequent to a business combination are required to be recorded in income during the quarter in which the transaction occurs. Accordingly, the   $48.5 million   decrease in the Company s net deferred tax assets resulted in the release of a corresponding   $48.5 million   valuation allowance and recognition of a tax benefit in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

13.   EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic earnings (loss) per share has been computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders includes the adjustment for net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by including the dilutive effect of common stock that would be issued assuming conversion or exercise of outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units. No such items were included in the computations of diluted loss per share in the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   because the Company incurred a net loss applicable to common shareholders in those periods and the effect of inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
  The table below shows the number of shares that were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive to the calculation: 

14.   SEGMENT INFORMATION    
  Segment information is based on a management approach, which requires segmentation based upon the Company s internal organization, reporting of revenue, and operating income. The Company s operations are classified into   six   reporting segments: Coal - U.S., Coal - Canada, Coal - WMLP, Power, Heritage, and Corporate. On August 1, 2015, the Company contributed   100%   of the outstanding equity interests in Westmoreland Kemmerer, LLC ( Kemmerer ) to WMLP (the  Kemmerer Drop ), and, accordingly, to enable comparability, all segment disclosures have been adjusted to remove financial information for Kemmerer from the Coal - U.S. segment and present it in the Coal - WMLP segment for each of the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  WMLP Series B Convertible Unit Exchange 
    
  On October 28, 2016, the Company exchanged its   4,512,500   common units representing limited partner interests in WMLP ( Common Units ) for   4,512,500   Series B Convertible Units representing limited partner interests in WMLP (the  Series B Units ). The Series B Units do not share in distributions with the Common Units and are convertible on a   one  -for-one basis into Common Units on the day after the record date for a cash distribution on the Common Units in which WMLP is unable to make such a distribution without exceeding its restricted payment basket under the WMLP Term Loan Facility and the WMLP Revolving Credit Facility. The Series B Units will also convert automatically upon a change of control or a dissolution or liquidation of WMLP. The Series B Units have the same voting rights as if they were outstanding Common Units and will vote together with the Common Units as a single class. In addition, the Series B Units are entitled to vote as a separate class on any matters that materially adversely affect the rights or preferences of the Series B Units in relation to other classes of partnership interests or as required by law.

  MANAGEMENT     S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONT.) 

Overview 
  Westmoreland Coal Company is the oldest independent coal company in the United States. Our coal operations include surface coal mines in the United States and Canada, underground coal mines in Ohio and New Mexico, a char production facility, and a 50% interest in an activated carbon plant. We also own the general partner of, and a majority of the equity interests in, WMLP, a publicly-traded coal master limited partnership. Our power operations include two coal-fired power generation units in North Carolina. We classify our business into four operating segments (Coal - U.S., Coal - Canada, Coal - WMLP and Power) and two non-operating segments (Heritage and Corporate). Our Heritage segment primarily includes the costs of benefits we provide to former mining operation employees and our Corporate segment consists primarily of corporate administrative and business development expenses. 
  We are a holding company and conduct our operations through subsidiaries. We have significant cash requirements to fund our ongoing debt obligations, pension contributions, heritage health benefit costs, and corporate overhead costs. The principal sources of cash flow to us are distributions from our operating subsidiaries. 
   
  San Juan Acquisition and Related Financing 
  On January 31, 2016, WSJ, a special purpose subsidiary of the Company, acquired SJCC, which operates the San Juan mine in Farmington, New Mexico, and SJTC for a total cash purchase price of approximately   $125.3 million  , subject to post-closing adjustments. The San Juan mine is the exclusive supplier of coal to the adjacent SJGS under a coal supply agreement through 2022. For details of the financing structure, see   Note 6 - Debt and Lines of Credit  .

     Consolidated revenue increased due to   $51.7 million   in revenue generated by our January 2016 San Juan acquisition, offset by softness at other locations. Our net loss improved by   $38.0 million   as a result of   $32.5 million   in improved operating income. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of strong operating results in our Coal-US and Coal-WMLP offset slightly by lower loan and lease receivable payments in our Coal-Canada segment.

     Revenue increased as a result of   $51.7 million   in revenue generated by our San Juan acquisition. This increase was offset by decreases from the expected expiration of certain contracts as well as cost reduction initiatives at cost plus mines leading to corresponding decreases in revenue.  Operating income grew primarily as a result of $14.0 million contributed by our San Juan acquisition. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by $18.5 million contributed by our San Juan acquisition as well as strong demand arising from favorable weather. Weather conditions are inherently unpredictable and could have positive or negative impacts on demand in future periods.

           (1) 
    Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined and reconciled to net loss at the end of this  Results of Operations  section. 
     Revenue decreased primarily as a result of lower tons sold and lower realized export market pricing at our Coal Valley mine. Future price changes are inherently unpredictable and such changes may or may not continue in the future. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by an accelerated loan and lease receivable payment received in the prior year that was not expected to recur at the same level in the current year.

Revenue decreased primarily as a result of continued pricing softness in Ohio. Whether this decrease persists in future years is dependent upon fluctuations in market demand in the region. Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA  increased primarily due to lower fuel and labor costs at our Ohio mines.

  Consolidated revenue increased due to $128.3 million in revenue generated by our San Juan acquisition, offset by softness at other locations. Our net loss improved by   $91.6 million   as a result of a   $45.5 million   increase in operating income as well as a   $63.3 million   increase in income tax benefit. The income tax benefit was primarily a result of the first quarter release of our valuation allowance on our net operating loss deferred tax asset arising from the San Juan acquisition. These increases in net income were offset by a   $13.8 million   increase in interest expense due to our higher debt levels arising from the San Juan acquisition. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of strong operating results in our Coal - U.S. and Coal - WMLP segments slightly offset by lower loan and lease receivable payments in our Coal - Canada segment.

    Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined and reconciled to net loss at the end of this  Results of Operations  section. 
     Revenue decreased primarily as a result of a weaker Canadian Dollar compared to the prior year. Whether this decrease persists in future periods is dependent upon fluctuations in the Canadian and U.S. Dollar exchange rate. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by an accelerated loan and lease receivable payment received in the second and third quarters of last year that returned to normal levels in the current year. In addition, the segment encountered record rainfall creating less efficient operating conditions at some facilities.

Operating loss decreased due to a loss on our power derivative of $2.2 million during the first nine months of 2016 compared to a loss of $6.7 million during the first nine months of 2015, as well as $7.4 million lower depreciation expense in 2016 as a result of the fourth quarter 2015 impairment charge. 
    
  Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA  
  The discussion in  Results of Operations  includes references to our Adjusted EBITDA results. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key metrics used by us to assess our operating performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting and we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because these measures: 
             
    are used widely by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors; 
                
    are used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate our creditworthiness; and 
                
    help investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results. 
     Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant in assessing our operating results. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:    
             
    do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments; 
                
    do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements necessary to pay income taxes; 
                
    do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and 
                
    do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on certain of our debt obligations. 
     In addition, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. Other companies in our industry and in other industries may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way that we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental data.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We had the following liquidity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :    

We anticipate that our cash from operations, cash on hand and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our investing, financing, and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future. During the third quarter of 2016 we announced that NRG Texas Power provided notice that it will terminate the lignite supply agreement at the Jewett mine two years early on December 31, 2016. This contract termination is not expected to have a material impact on our cash flows in the foreseeable future.  
  We conduct our operations through subsidiaries. We have significant cash requirements to fund our debt obligations, ongoing heritage health benefit costs, pension contributions, and corporate overhead expenses. The principal sources of cash flow to the parent company are distributions from our operating subsidiaries. The cash at all of our subsidiaries is immediately available, except Westmoreland Risk Management, Inc. ( WRMI ), the Westmoreland San Juan Entities, and WMLP. The cash at our captive insurance entity, WRMI, is available to us through dividends and is subject to maintaining a statutory minimum level of capital, which is $0.25 million. The cash at the Westmoreland San Juan Entities is governed as described in   Note 6 - Debt and Lines of Credit  .   
  In October 2016, the Company exchanged its 4,512,500 Common Units for 4,512,500 Series B Units. The Series B Units do not share in distributions with the Common Units and are convertible on a one-for-one basis into Common Units on the day after the record date for a cash distribution on the Common Units in which WMLP is unable to make such a distribution without exceeding its restricted payment basket under the WMLP Term Loan Facility and the WMLP Revolving Credit Facility. The Series B Units will also convert automatically upon a change of control or a dissolution or liquidation of WMLP. The Series B Units have the same voting rights as if they were outstanding Common Units and will vote together with the Common Units as a single class. In addition, the Series B Units are entitled to vote as a separate class on any matters that materially adversely affect the rights or preferences of the Series B Units in relation to other classes of partnership interests or as required by law. As the Series B Units do not share in distributions with the Common Units we will not receive quarterly cash distributions from WMLP unless and until the Series B Units are converted to Common Units.  
  Debt Obligations 
  See     Note 6 - Debt and Lines of Credit   for a description of our different debt facilities. From time to time depending on market conditions and available cash, we intend to strategically repurchase our outstanding debt. 
  Restricted Group and Unrestricted Group Results 
  Under the indenture governing the 8.75% Notes (the  Indenture ), the WCC Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, WSJ, Westmoreland Resources GP, LLC, WMLP and all of WMLP s subsidiaries are designated as  unrestricted subsidiaries  (the  Unrestricted Group ). All of our other subsidiaries are restricted subsidiaries (the  Restricted Group ).

Historical Sources and Uses of Cash 
  The following table summarizes net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :    

For the first nine months of 2016, our operating activities generated   $84.2 million   in cash flows as a result of our continued execution on our mine mouth strategy. Investing activities used   $147.4 million   in cash, including   $125.3 million   used to acquire the San Juan mine. Financing activities provided   $68.3 million   in cash, most notably   $122.3 million   in borrowings to finance the San Juan Acquisition. This was offset by   $43.9 million   in repayments of long-term debt including a $15.0 million payment on San Juan debt and the remainder primarily being comprised of capital lease repayments.  
  Asset Retirement Obligations, Contractual Third-party Reclamation Receivables, Reclamation Deposits and Reclamation Bond Collateral 
  The asset retirement obligations and related contractual third-party reclamation receivables, reclamation deposits and reclamation bond collateral for each of the Company s operating segments at   September 30, 2016   are summarized below: 

Other restricted investments include various investments not associated with reclamation obligations. Reclamation spend, net of customer receipts for reclamation, was   $23.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds. We utilize surety bonds and letters of credit issued by financial institutions to third parties to assure the performance of our obligations relating to reclamation, workers  compensation obligations, postretirement medical benefit obligations, and other obligations. These arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off-balance sheet arrangements. 
  Our off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
   
           ITEM 3 
        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
     Other than the changes below, there have been no material changes in our market risk since   December 31, 2015  . For additional information, refer to the  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in Item 7A of our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We are exposed to commodity price risk on sales of power at our ROVA facility. We have entered into derivative contracts to purchase power in the future at fixed prices. Such derivative contracts are structured to manage our exposure to changing power prices and not for trading. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we incurred a loss of   $2.2 million   and   $6.7 million  , respectively, from these derivative contracts. Since any resales which we may make in the open market under these derivative contracts would be made at prevailing market prices, we may be subject to further losses under these hedging arrangements in the event that the market price for power falls below the level of our hedged position. Based on current market pricing trends, we may experience further losses under these hedging arrangements before the market price for power regains a level which is commensurate with our hedged position. If these trends continue, these losses could continue to adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, and anticipated future cash losses are likely to be material. 
   
           ITEM 4 
        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
     As required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), management has evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 
  On January 31, 2016, we closed on the San Juan Acquisition. As a result of this acquisition, we are in the process of reviewing the internal controls of the San Juan mine operations and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as we incorporate our controls and procedures into the acquired operations. Except for the San Juan Acquisition, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 
  OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 
        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
     We are subject, from time-to-time, to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims ( Actions ) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, adverse developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and may result in a negative impact on income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. However, we do not believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 
   
           ITEM 1A 
        RISK FACTORS. 
     We have disclosed under the heading  Risk Factors  in our   2015   Form 10-K, the risk factors that we believe materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Please see below for additions to our risk factor disclosure. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the   2015   Form 10-K, the additional risk factors set forth below and the other information set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and or operating results. 
  Risks Related to the Exchange of our Common Units in WMLP for Series B Units of WMLP  
    
  The exchange of our Common Units in WMLP for Series B Units of WMLP will negatively affect our cash flow. 
  Since acquiring the GP and a significant limited partner interest in WMLP, we have received quarterly cash distributions from WMLP. Unlike the Common Units and the Series A Units, the Series B Units are not entitled to receive such distributions. As a result, our exchanging 4,512,500 Common Units for the same amount of Series B Units will cause us to forfeit cash distributions associated with the Common Units, resulting in a decrease of approximately $601,516 in quarterly cash flow based on WMLP s current quarterly distribution amount of $0.1333 per Common Unit. This negative impact to our cash flow could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations as a whole. 
    
  The conversion of Series B Units of WMLP back to Common Units in WMLP is anticipated to result in additional tax losses being allocated to us that may occur over multiple years. 
  The Series B Units are convertible on a one-for-one basis into Common Units on the day after the record date for a cash distribution on the Common Units in which WMLP is unable to make such a distribution without exceeding its restricted payment basket under the WMLP Term Loan Facility and the WMLP Revolving Credit Facility. The Series B Units will also convert automatically upon a change of control or a dissolution or liquidation of WMLP. Upon the conversion of Series B Units to Common Units, allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction will be made to cause the Common Units received to be fungible with the Common Units held by others. It is anticipated that this will result in an allocation of losses or deductions to WMLP. While the conversion of a Series B Unit occurs at a particular time, the allocations may occur over multiple years. If the allocations do not occur in the same year as the conversion, we will have fewer losses or deductions in that year than otherwise might be the case. 

ITEM 2 
        UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
     The Company s purchases of its common stock during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

____________________ 
           (1) 
    Shares purchased as indicated in this table represent the withholding of a portion of restricted shares to cover taxes on vested restricted shares and were not made pursuant to a publicly announced share repurchase plan or program.

In July 2016, the Company learned that transactions in Westmoreland Common Stock in the San Juan Salaried Employee 401(k) Plan (the  Transitional 401(k) Plan ), a one year transitional plan governing a small group of San Juan Coal Company participants until it is merged into the Company s existing 401(k) Plan, were executed without such transitional plan being explicitly referenced on the Company s previously filed registration statement on Form S-8 covering 401(k) plan interests and so may be considered unregistered sales of Westmoreland Common Stock. The transactions in Westmoreland Common Stock in the Transitional 401(k) Plan may have included: (i) initial investment of salary reduction contributions from employees, (ii) fixed matching source funds from Westmoreland and (iii) intra-plan transfers of funds by participants out of other investments into Westmoreland Common Stock (collectively, the  Transactions ).  The Transactions took place between February 24, 2016 and August 2, 2016, with a total of 29,479 shares at an average price paid per share of $6.91.   

ITEM 4 
          MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. 
     On July 21, 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ). Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act contains reporting requirements regarding mine safety. Mine safety violations or other regulatory matters, as required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, are included as Exhibit 95.1 to this report on Form 10-Q.

     The amounts outstanding under the Parent Company s long-term debt consisted of the following as of the dates indicated:    

The following table presents aggregate contractual debt maturities of all long-term debt for the Parent Company:    

The Company amended the terms of its revolving line of credit ( WCC Revolving Credit Facility ) on September 30, 2016 and October 12, 2016, respectively. The September 30 amendment clarified the terms  Canadian Fixed Charges  and  US Fixed Charges  to allocate scheduled cash interest payments and to remove the allocation schedule of cash interest payments under the term  Interest Expense.  The October 12 amendment (1) replaced the previous lender, Bank of the West, with a new lender, East West Bank, (2) amended Interest Expense to remove certain dividend payments, (3) revised the term  Required Lenders  to constitute all lenders when only two unaffiliated lenders are party to the revolving credit facility, (4) removed the requirement of the delivery of a social responsibility questionnaire in connection with a Permitted Acquisition, (5) allowed for any Lender to provide the Swing Line Lender one day s prior written notice prohibiting a US Swing Line Loan or Canadian Swing Line Loan, (6) removed Administrative Agent discretion on application of proceeds from the sale of Collateral, (7) adjusted Annual Projections reporting requirements to no longer require delivery of a balance sheet and (8) adjusted the waterfall treatment with respect to Proceeds of Collateral.  
  Under the Company s WCC Revolving Credit Facility the Company has a total aggregate borrowing capacity of   $60.0 million   between June 15th and August 31st of each year, with an aggregate borrowing capacity of   $50.0 million   outside of these periods. The availability of the WCC Revolving Credit Facility consists of a   $30.0 million   sub-facility (  $35.0 million   with the seasonal increase) available to our U.S. borrowers and a   $20.0 million   sub-facility (  $25.0 million   with the seasonal increase) available to our Canadian borrowers. The facility may support an equal amount of letters of credit, with outstanding letter of credit balances reducing availability under the facility. At   September 30, 2016  , availability on the WCC Revolving Credit Facility was   $36.3 million   with an outstanding balance of   $13.7 million   supporting letters of credit and   nothing   drawn on the WCC Revolving Credit Facility.  The WCC Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of   December 31, 2018  . We were in compliance with all covenant requirements of the WCC Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  .

Due to the adoption of ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , debt issuance costs related to the Company s debt liabilities are now reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of the notes. The adoption of this standard resulted in the reclassification of   $17.5 million   of unamortized debt issuance costs from the non-current asset,   Other assets,   to a reduction of   Long-term debt, less current portion   on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

EXHIBIT 95.1 
  Mine Safety Disclosure 
  The following disclosures are provided pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which require certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate coal mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act). The disclosures reflect United States (U.S.) mining operations only, as these requirements do not apply to our mines operated outside the U.S.  
  Mine Safety Information.    Whenever the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a violation which describes the associated condition or practice and designates a timeframe within which the operator must abate the violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until hazards are corrected. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the violation that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed and, as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes vacated. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the company and mine. Since MSHA is a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor, its jurisdiction applies only to our U.S. mines. As such, the mine safety disclosures that follow contain no information for our Canadian mines. 
  The table that follows reflects citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . The table includes only those mines that were issued orders or citations during the period presented and, commensurate with SEC regulations, does not reflect orders or citations issued to independent contractors working at our mines. Due to timing and other factors, our data may not agree with the mine data retrieval system maintained by MSHA. The proposed assessments for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   were taken from the MSHA system as of   October 28, 2016  . 

(1) 
    Mine Act Section 104(a) citations are for alleged violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal mine safety or health hazard. 
              (2) 
    Mine Act Section 104(b) orders are for alleged failures to totally abate a citation within the period of time specified in the citation. 
              (3) 
    Mine Act Section 104(d) citations and orders are for an alleged unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards. 
              (4) 
    Total number of flagrant violations issued under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. 
              (5) 
    Mine Act Section 107(a) orders are for alleged conditions or practices that could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated and result in orders of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition. 
              (6) 
    Total dollar value of MSHA assessments proposed during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (7) 
    Total number of mining-related fatalities during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
              (8) 
    Mine Act Section 104(e) written notices are for an alleged pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of a coal mine health or safety hazard, or the potential to have such a pattern. 
              (9) 
    Any pending legal action before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the  Commission ) involving a coal mine owned and operated by us.  The number of legal actions pending as of   September 30, 2016   that fall into each of the following categories is as follows: 
     (a)  Contests of citations and orders:  15 
  (b)  Contests of proposed penalties:  0 
  (c)  Complaints for compensation:  0 
  (d)  Complaints of discharge, discrimination or interference:  0 
  (e)  Applications for temporary relief:  0 
  (f)  Appeals of judges' decisions or orders to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission:  0
