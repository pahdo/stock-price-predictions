(1) Nature of Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Organization and Basis of Presentation

WestMountain Company ("we", "our" or the "Company"), formerly known as WestMountain Asset Management, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Colorado on October 18, 2007 and on this date approved its business plan and commenced operations. The consolidated financial statements include the financial information of WestMountain Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, WestMountain Business Consulting, Inc., WestMountain Allocation Analytics, Inc., and WestMountain Valuation Services, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

As a consultant to both public and private companies, we promote public visibility and market acceptance for our clients. We use a number of techniques to achieve these objectives for our clients, including developing public recognition of their business plans and strategic goals, managing investor relations, and engaging in website development and media production. We also utilize various social media outlets and services to deliver our client's message. We are paid fees for our services by our clients under written consulting agreements.

Unaudited Financial Information

The accompanying financial information as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited. In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments which are necessary to provide a fair presentation of the Company's financial position at September 30, 2016 and its operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been made. Certain information and footnote data necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is therefore suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the summary of significant accounting policies and notes to financial statements included in the Company's annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is not necessarily an indication of operating results to be expected for the year.

Income Tax Receivable

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an income tax receivable of $30,281 that is related to estimated tax payments on deposit with federal and state taxing authorities.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the ASC 820 hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's significant market assumptions. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:

- 6 - 

WestMountain Company.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, default rates, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3: Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use.

The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The carrying amounts of financial assets require to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis including our major assets that approximates fair value as determined by using the future expected net cash flows on the sale of the investments.

Available-for-sale securities are accounted for on a specific identification basis. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively, we held available-for-sale marketable securities with an aggregate fair value of $105,331 and $117,022 respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, all of our available-for-sale securities were invested in publically traded equity holdings. Available-for-sale securities were classified as current based on the percentage of the equity controlled by the Company as well as our intended use of the assets. The Company recognized unrealized losses, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in the amounts of ($22,838) and ($443,423), respectively.

The Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were as follows:

The Company has determined that WestMountain Distressed Debt, Inc., (WMDS) is considered a "variable interest entity", however, WestMountain Company is not the primary beneficiary.

WestMountain Company provided funding to WMDS to assist in paying their current operational expenses. The Company is not the only financial supporter to WMDS. The first note was dated October 17, 2014. Below is a summary of the notes with WMDS that have been written off as of December 31, 2015.

The total funding at risk is not sufficient to permit this entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

WestMountain Company is not a majority equity stakeholder in WMDS, nor does it have voting control, control of the board of directors, or substantive management rights. Given that the Company does not have the power to direct their activities that most significantly impact its economic performance, the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of WMDS and therefore is not required to consolidate this entity. 

The Company will assess any additional transactions with WMDS to determine if the entity will need to be consolidated with the Company based on the VIE disclosure requirements.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the following investments in marketable and nonmarketable securities were held in related parties due to common principal ownership:

On May 7, 2015 Omni Bio Pharmaceutical filed a Form 8-K.  This company has been unsuccessful in its fundraising and partnering/licensing efforts and does not anticipate being able to raise sufficient capital to continue operations. Consequently, the Board of Directors of Omni Bio Parmaceutical approved an orderly wind down, including negotiations with its senior secured creditor, Bohemian Investments, LLC. This loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary and this investment was fully impaired during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 resulting in a loss on impairment of available for sale marketable securities of $193,634.

Results of Operations

The following discussion involves our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded aggregate advisory/consulting revenue of $51,934 and $50,225, respectively. Of the advisory/consulting revenue recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $43,970 and $33,786, respectively, is related party revenue for services performed on behalf of Nexcore Group LP and Bohemian Asset Management, Inc. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded aggregate advisory/consulting revenue of $136,384 and $154,439, respectively. Of the advisory/consulting revenue recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $119,970 and $114,000, respectively, is related party revenue for services performed on behalf of Nexcore Group LP and Bohemian Asset Management, Inc. The Company, Nexcore and Bohemian are under common principal ownership.

- 12 - 

Our revenue remains subject to greater uncertainty than if we had revenue commitments from a number of clients not under common principal ownership. We could be materially impacted if the current arrangement does not continue, and we cannot replace our current clients with other clients.

Operating expenses were $85,912 and $86,375 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Operating expenses were $246,129 and $244,570 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Most of the expenses are related to payroll and contract services.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 we had a net loss of $153,661. In comparison, for the three months ended September 30, 2015 we had a net loss of $27,924. Most of the increase in net loss was a result of an income tax expense of $119,683 recorded 2016; offset by an income tax benefit of $5,330 record in 2015.  The expense of $119,683 recorded in 2016 was partly associated with an allowance that was recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of $252,270 and $177,475, respectively. Most of the increase in net loss was a result of a write-off, in 2015, of an investment in Omni Bio Pharmaceutical, Inc. of $193,634, offset by an impairment of our non marketable securities of $60,000 in 2016. In 2015 there was an income tax benefit of $93,373; offset by an income tax expense of $87,087 in 2016. In addition, for the nine months ended 2016 we had a decrease of total revenue of $18,055 over the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The expense of $87,087 recorded in 2016 was partly associated with an allowance that was recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets.

As of September 30, 2016, we hold nine investment positions. All the companies classified as marketable securities are publicly traded and listed on the OTC Bulletin Board. Those classified as nonmarketable are private companies or do not have an active market for their shares, although they may be listed for trading. The table below lists the investments and total shares owned by us as of September 30, 2016.

Our eighth position involves Marine Exploration, Inc. In 2008 the Company invested $50,000 for 175,000,000 shares of common stock in Marine Exploration, which represented 39% of the outstanding common stock of Marine Exploration. The Company recorded this long-term investment using the equity method of accounting for investments. Any net income or net loss must be recorded against the Company's investment, not to exceed the original investment of $50,000. Marine Exploration incurred significant losses during 2008, and the investment was reduced to zero. On August 24, 2010, Marine Exploration authorized a reverse split of 1 new share for 500 old shares of their common stock. As of this date, the Company has less than 1% ownership in Marine Exploration.

Our ninth position is with Omni Bio Pharmaceutical, Inc. On May 7, 2015 Omni Bio Pharmaceutical filed a Form 8-K.  This company has been unsuccessful in its fundraising and partnering/licensing efforts and does not anticipate being able to raise sufficient capital to continue operations. Consequently, the Board of Directors of Omni Bio approved an orderly wind down, including negotiations with its senior secured creditor, Bohemian Investments, LLC. We acquired, through a reorganization, 1,707,107 shares for a cost of $193,634. As of September 30, 2015, we fully impaired this investment resulting in a loss on impairment of available for sale marketable securities of $193,634.

During February 2016, the Company paid $30,000 for 6.98 of RavenBrick Class C unit shares. RavenBrick is an existing customer we provide advisory services to. These services consist of, but are not limited to, developing public recognition of their business plans and strategic goals, and engaging in website development and media production. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, these nonmarketable securities were fully impaired resulting in an impairment loss of $30,000. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company exchanged advisory services for an additional 3.72 of RavenBrick Class C unit shares recognized at no value.

On December 31, 2015 management evaluated the collectability of the notes and determined it was necessary to write the balances off. A total of $71,386 was expensed to the income statement.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash of $428,098.

Net cash used in operating activities was $123,003 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This amount was related to non-cash expenses of $154,040, offset by a net loss of $252,270. Non-cash expenses were mainly made up of the loss on impairment of non-marketable securities of $60,000, and deferred income tax of $95,061. Operating assets and operating liabilities decreased by $24,773. Net cash used in operating activities were $129,701 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This amount was related to non-cash expenses of $169,549, offset by a net loss of $177,475. Non-cash expenses were mainly made up of the loss on impairment of available for sale marketable securities of $193,634, offset by the deferred income tax benefit of $25,628. Operating assets and operating liabilities decreased by $121,775. This decrease was mainly related to the income tax receivable of $141,991 and accounts receivable, related parties of $41,125, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $24,239.

Net cash used in investing activities was $28,870 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $44,119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company invested $30,000 in a non-public company, along with the purchase of equipment of $3, 432 and the sale of equipment of  $4,562 in 2016.  In 2015, we entered into a Promissory Note Agreements with WestMountain Distressed Debt, Inc., a related party, in the amount of $42,407 and purchased equipment of $1,712.

Over the next twelve months we do not expect any material capital costs for our operations.

Currently, we believe that we have sufficient capital to implement our business operations or to sustain them at our present level, until we regain profitability. To date, we have never had any discussions with any possible acquisition candidate nor have we any intention of doing so.

We operate out of one office in Colorado. We have no specific plans at this point for additional offices.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements with any party.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in ASC 820. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the ASC 820 hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's significant market assumptions. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, default rates, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3: Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use.

The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The carrying amounts of financial assets require to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis including our major assets that approximates fair value as determined by using the future expected net cash flows on the sale of the investments.

Revenue Recognition 

We provide investor relations, website development, video production, and associated marketing and media services to clients. We are paid fees for our services by our clients under written consulting agreements.  As a secondary source of revenue, we raise, invest and manage private equity and direct investment funds for third parties including high net worth individuals and institutions. We earn management fees based on the size of the funds that we manage and incentive income based on the performance of these funds. We do not focus on any particular industry but look at any and all opportunities. We will screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with long term potential.

- 15 - 

Revenue is recognized under the full accrual method. Under the full accrual method, profit may be realized in full when funds are invested and managed, provided (1) the profit is determinable and (2) the earnings process is virtually complete (the Company is not obligated to perform significant activities).

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

None.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a -15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the applicable time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms due to the existence of material weaknesses.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 240.13a-15(e) or Rule 240.15d-15(e) of this chapter that occurred during our most recent fiscal three months that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

This report does not include an attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

There are no legal proceedings, to which we are a party, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this document before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock.

The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating result. In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

We have a limited operating history. While we have not been profitable for our most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. If we never achieve sustained profitability, we could go out of business.

We were formed as a Colorado business entity in October, 2007. In the past, we have been profitable. While we have not been profitable for our most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and prior to 2013, we were profitable for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. We recognize that we must achieve ongoing profitability to be viable over the long term. If we never achieve sustained profitability, we could go out of business.

We currently rely upon clients under common principal control of our majority shareholder for approximately 84.7% of our current quarter revenues, which means that we could be severally impacted if the current arrangement does not continue and we cannot replace our current clients with other clients.

Approximately 84.7% of the revenues of our clients in the third quarter of 2016 came from entities which were under common principal ownership with our majority shareholder. Our revenue projections are subject to greater uncertainty than if we had revenue commitments from a number of clients not under common principal ownership. We could be materially impacted if the current arrangement does not continue, and we cannot replace our current clients with other clients. While we have no basis to believe that we will not continue to generate revenue from this arrangement, we cannot assure you that these clients or any of our clients, will continue to purchase our products or services in significant volume, or at all.

Our lack of operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance. An investor could lose his entire investment.

We have a limited operating history. An investor has no frame of reference to evaluate our future business prospects. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate us as an investment. An investor could lose his entire investment if our future business prospects do not result in our ever sustaining profitability.

If we do not continue to generate adequate revenues to finance our operations, our business may fail.

As of September 30, 2016, we had a cash position of $428,098. We anticipate that operating costs will range between $300,000 and $400,000, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. These operating costs include payroll, contract services, marketing costs, and all other costs of operations. We will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly or monthly fee basis. However, the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict. We expect to continue to generate revenues in the next twelve months from our fee-based marketing, media and investor relations consulting services. Since there can be no assurances that revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs for the foreseeable future, it may be necessary to raise additional funds. Due to our lack of operating history, raising additional funds may be difficult.

Competition in our industry is intense.

Our business plan involves acting as a fee-based marketing and media consultant to public and private companies. This business is highly competitive. There are numerous similar companies providing such services in the United States of America. Our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business. Our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully market our services in this highly competitive environment. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully.

The share control position of WestMountain Blue, LLC will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate actions.

Our largest shareholder, WestMountain Blue, LLC, of which Mr. Klemsz is a 16.8% member, owns 8,505,652 shares and thereby controls approximately 90% of our outstanding shares. Because WestMountain Blue, LLC individually beneficially controls more than a majority of the outstanding shares, other shareholders, individually or as a group, will be limited in their ability to effectively influence the election or removal of our directors, the supervision and management of our business or a change in control of or sale of our company, even if they believed such changes were in the best interest of our shareholders generally.

- 17 - 

Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our President and Treasurer

We depend almost entirely on the efforts and continued employment of Mr. Anderson, our President, and Mr. Klemsz, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer. Mr. Anderson is our primary operations officer, and we will depend on him for nearly all aspects of our operations. We do not have an employment contract with either Mr. Anderson or Mr. Klemsz, and we do not carry key person insurance on the life of either gentleman. The loss of the services of either Mr. Anderson or Mr. Klemsz through incapacity or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our business. It would be very difficult to find and retain qualified personnel such as either Mr. Anderson or Mr. Klemsz.

Our success also depends upon our ability to develop relationships with our clients. If we cannot develop sufficient relationships, we may never become profitable.  An investor could lose his entire investment.

We now have one line of business. We operate as a fee-based marketing and media consultant to client companies, which include both public and private entities.  Our success now depends, in large part, on our ability to develop relationships with potential consulting services clients. We have no long-term contracts or other contractual assurances of consulting services. We may never develop sufficient consulting services clients, which would negatively impact our proposed operations. As a result, we may never become profitable or be able to sustain profitability. An investor could lose his or her entire investment.

Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock 

The lack of a broker or dealer to create or maintain a market in our stock could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities.

We have no agreement with any broker or dealer to act as a market maker for our securities and there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any market makers. Thus, no broker or dealer will have an incentive to make a market for our stock. The lack of a market maker for our securities could adversely influence the market for and price of our securities, as well as your ability to dispose of, or to obtain accurate information about, and/or quotations as to the price of, our securities.

We have limited experience as a public company.

We have only operated as a public company since January, 2009. We trade on the OTC Bulletin Board under the trading symbol WASM. Thus, we have limited experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.

We may be required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisors Act, which could increase the regulatory burden on us and could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities.

Because our proposed business may involve the identification, acquisition and development of investments, we may be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisors Act and analogous state law. While we believe that we are currently either not an investment company or an investment advisor or are exempt from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisors Act and analogous state law, either the SEC or state regulators, or both, may disagree and could require registration either immediately or at some point in the future. As a result, there could be an increased regulatory burden on us, which could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities.

- 18 - 

Our stock has a limited public trading market and there is no guarantee an active trading market will ever develop for our securities.

There has been, and continues to be, a limited public market for our common stock. An active trading market for our shares has not, and may never develop or be sustained. If you purchase shares of common stock, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial price you paid. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following: 

* 
 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

* 
 
 changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;

* 
 
 changes in market valuations of other companies, particularly those that market services such as ours;

* 
 
  announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations,  acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

* 
 
 introduction of product enhancements that reduce the need for the products our projects may develop;

* 
 
 departures of key personnel.

Of our total outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015, a total of 8,755,652, or approximately 91.99%, will be restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.

As restrictions on resale end, the market price of our stock could drop significantly if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.

Applicable SEC rules governing the trading of "Penny Stocks" limit the liquidity of our common stock, which may affect the trading price of our common stock.

Our common stock is currently quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and trades well below $5.00 per share. As a result, our common stock is considered a "penny stock" and is subject to SEC rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded.  These regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock and the associated risks.  Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the written purchaser's agreement to a transaction prior to purchase.  These regulations have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock.

The over-the-counter market for stock such as ours is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations.

The securities of companies such as ours have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods. These broad market fluctuations and other factors, such as new product developments and trends in the our industry and in the investment markets generally, as well as economic conditions and quarterly variations in our operational results, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.

- 19 - 

Buying low-priced penny stocks is very risky and speculative.

Our common shares are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with spouse, or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in the public markets. 

Issuances of our stock could dilute current shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, if an active public trading market develops.

We have the authority to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval. Although no financing is planned currently, we may need to raise additional capital to fund operating losses. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution. In addition, we could issue large blocks of our common stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further stockholder approval.

The issuance of preferred stock by our board of directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. An issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could, upon conversion or otherwise, have all of the rights of our common stock. Our board of directors' authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve.

Colorado law and our Articles of Incorporation protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits, which could make it difficult for us to recover damages from them in the event of a lawsuit.

Colorado law provides that our directors will not be liable to our company or to our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors. Our Articles of Incorporation require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require our company to use our assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.

We do not expect to pay dividends on common stock.

We have not paid any cash dividends with respect to our common stock, and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Earnings, if any, that we may realize will be retained in the business for further development and expansion.

Exhibit 31.1

CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 302

OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

I, Brian L. Klemsz, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this quarterly report of WestMountain Company on Form 10-Q;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the issuer as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The small business issuer's other certifying officer and I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))  for the small business issuer and have;

Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure the material information relating to the small business issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over   financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

Evaluated the effectiveness of the small business issuer's disclosure controls and procedures and  presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation.

Disclosed in this report any change in the small business issuer's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the small business issuer's most recent fiscal quarter (the small business issuer's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the small business issuer's internal control over financial reporting; and
