1.           DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Overview 

QuantRx Biomedical Corporation was incorporated on December 5,
1986, in the State of Nevada. Our principal business office is
located at 10190 SW 90th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97123. When used
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms
   Company  , 
   we  , 
   our  , 
   ours  , 
or    us   
mean QuantRx Biomedical Corporation, a Nevada
corporation.  

We have developed   and intend to
commercialize our innovative PAD based products for the
over-the-counter markets for the treatment of hemorrhoids, minor
vaginal infection, urinary incontinence, general catamenial uses
and other medical needs. We are developing and intend to
commercialize genomic diagnostics for the laboratory market, based
on our patented PadKit  technology.  Our platforms
include: inSync , Unique , PadKit , and OEM branded
over-the-counter and laboratory testing products based on our core
intellectual property related to our PAD
technology.  

The continuation of our operations remain contingent on the receipt
of financing required to execute our business and operating plan,
which is currently focused on the commercialization of our PAD
technology either directly or through a joint venture, or other
relationship intended to increase shareholder value.  In the
interim, we have nominal operations, focused principally on
maintaining our intellectual property portfolio and continuing to
comply with the public company reporting requirements. No
assurances can be given that we will obtain financing, or otherwise
successfully develop a business and operating plan or enter into an
alternative relationship to commercialize our PAD
technology. 

Our diagnostic testing business, operating under our subsidiary QX
Labs, Inc. (   QX   ) (the    Diagnostic
Business   ) is based
principally on the Company s proprietary PadKit 
technology, which we believe provides a patented platform
technology for genomic diagnostics, including fetal genomics.
Outside of the Diagnostic Business, our business line consists of
our over-the-counter business, including the InSync feminine
hygienic interlabial pad, the Unique  Miniform for hemorrhoid
application, and other treated miniforms (the
   OTC
Business   ), as well as
established and continuing licensing relationships related to the
OTC Business. Management believes this corporate structure permits
the Company to more efficiently explore options to maximize the
value of the Diagnostics Business and the OTC Business
(collectively, the    Businesses   ), with the objective of maximizing the
value of the Businesses for the benefit of the Company and its
stakeholders.  

Our current focus is to obtain additional working capital necessary
to continue as a going concern, and develop a longer term financing
and operating plan to: (i) leverage our broad-based intellectual
property and patent portfolio to develop new and innovative
diagnostic products; (ii) commercialize our OTC Business and
Diagnostics Business either directly or through joint ventures,
mergers or similar transactions intended to capitalize on
commercial opportunities presented by each of the Businesses; (iii)
contract manufacturing to third parties while maintaining control
over the manufacturing process; and (iv) maximize the value of our
investments in non-core assets.  However, as a result of
our current financial condition, our efforts in the short-term will
be focused on obtaining financing necessary to continue as a going
concern. 

We follow the accounting guidance outlined in the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Codification guidelines. The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted principles
for interim financial information and with the items under
Regulation S-X required by the instructions to Form 10-Q. 
They may not include all information and footnotes required by
United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(   GAAP   ) for complete financial statements. 
However, except as disclosed herein, there have been no material
changes in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on April 13, 2016.  The
interim unaudited financial statements presented herein should be
read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the
Form 10-K.  In the opinion of Management, all adjustments
considered necessary for a fair presentation, which unless
otherwise disclosed herein, consisting primarily of normal
recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2016.   

Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported losses,
total assets or stockholders equity.

Recent Developments 

Global Cancer Diagnostic, Inc. Letter of Intent  . On September 3, 2015, we entered into a
non-binding letter of intent (the    Global LOI   ) with Global Cancer Diagnostics, Inc., a
privately held laboratory in Tempe, Arizona
(   Global   ), for a proposed business combination. The
Global LOI had an original termination date of October 31, 2015
(the    Termination
Date   ), but could be
terminated or extended anytime by the mutual written consent of the
parties.  

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the executed Global LOI, the Company
deemed the Global LOI terminated. Accordingly, Global is obligated
to issue to us a number of shares of Global s common stock
equal to 10% of its then outstanding shares of common stock, on a
fully-diluted basis, as payment of the Global Advance. In addition
to the share issuance, the Company is evaluating certain additional
remedies related to the Global LOI and the $50,000 advance. The
Company has deemed the $50,000 Global Advance to be fully impaired
as of September 30, 2016. 

2.           MANAGEMENT
STATEMENT REGARDING GOING CONCERN 

The Company currently is not generating revenue from
operations.  The Company has historically financed its
operations primarily through issuances of equity and the proceeds
from the issuance of promissory notes.  In the past, the
Company also provided for its cash needs by issuing Common Stock,
options and warrants for certain operating costs, including
consulting and professional fees, as well as divesting its minority
equity interests and equity-linked investments. 

The Company s history of operating losses, limited cash
resources and the absence of an operating plan necessary to
capitalize on the Company s assets raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern, absent a strengthening of our cash
position.  Management is currently pursuing various
funding options, including seeking debt or equity financing,
licensing opportunities and the sale of certain investment
holdings, as well as a strategic merger or other transaction, to
obtain additional funding to continue the development of, and to
successfully commercialize, its products.  There can be
no assurance that we will be successful in our
efforts.  Should the Company be unable to obtain adequate
financing or generate sufficient revenue in the future, our
business, result of operations, liquidity and financial condition
will be materially and adversely harmed, and we will be unable to
continue as a going concern. 

There can be no assurance that, assuming that we are able to
strengthen our cash position, we will achieve sufficient revenue or
profitable operations to continue as a going concern. 

3.           SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is
presented to assist in understanding the Company s financial
statements. The financial statements and notes are representations
of the Company s management, which is responsible for their
integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to
GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the
financial statements. 

Accounting for Share-Based Payments.    The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic
718, which establishes the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges equity securities for services and requires
companies to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over
the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option pricing model in determining fair value. Accordingly,
compensation cost has been recognized using the fair value method
and expected term accrual requirements as
prescribed.  During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company had no stock compensation
expense.  

The Company accounts for share-based payments granted to
non-employees in accordance with ASC Topic 505,
   Equity Based Payments to
Non-Employees  .  The
Company determines the fair value of the stock-based payment as
either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair
value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable.  If the fair value of the equity instruments
issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other
measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (i) the date at
which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the
equity instruments is reached, or (ii) the date at which the
counterparty s performance is complete.

Table of Contents  

In the case of modifications, the Black-Scholes model is used to
value modified warrants on the modification date by applying the
revised assumptions. The difference between the fair value of the
warrants prior to the modification and after the modification
determines the incremental value. The Company has modified warrants
in connection with the issuance of certain notes and note
extensions. These modified warrants were originally issued in
connection with previous private placement investments. In the case
of debt issuances, the warrants were accounted for as original
issuance discount based on their relative fair values. When
modified in connection with a note issuance, the Company recognizes
the incremental value as a part of the debt discount calculation,
using its relative fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20,
   Debt
with Conversion and Other Options  .  When modified in connection with note
extensions, the Company recognized the incremental value as prepaid
interest, which is expensed over the term of the
extension.  

The fair value of each share based payment is estimated on the
measurement date using the Black-Scholes model with the following
assumptions, which are determined at the beginning of each year and
utilized in all calculations for that year. During the year ended
December 31, 2015, the Company   used an average risk
free interest rate of 0.52%, a dividend yield of zero, and an
average expected volatility of 417%. The Company did not issue any
equity securities during the nine months ended September 30,
2016.  

Risk-Free Interest Rate.   The interest rate used is based on the yield
of a U.S. Treasury security as of the beginning of the
year.  

Expected Volatility.   The
Company calculates the expected volatility based on historical
volatility of monthly stock prices over a three-year
period.  

Dividend Yield.   The
Company has never paid cash dividends, and does not currently
intend to pay cash dividends, and thus has assumed a 0% dividend
yield.  

Expected Term.   For
options, the Company has no history of employee exercise patterns.
Therefore, the Company uses the option term as the expected term.
For warrants, the Company uses the actual term of the
warrant.  

Pre-Vesting Forfeitures.   Estimates of pre-vesting option forfeitures
are based on Company experience. The Company will adjust its
estimate of forfeitures over the requisite service period based on
the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to
differ, from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures will
be recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the
period of change and will also impact the amount of compensation
expense to be recognized in future periods.  

Earnings per Share.    The Company computes net income (loss) per common
share in accordance with ASC Topic 260. Net income (loss) per share
is based upon the weighted average number of outstanding common
shares and the dilutive effect of common share equivalents, such as
options and warrants to purchase Common Stock, convertible
preferred stock and convertible notes, if applicable, that are
outstanding each year. Basic and diluted earnings per share were
the same at the reporting dates of the accompanying financial
statements, as including Common Stock equivalents in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share would have been
antidilutive.  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding options
exercisable for 2,352,000 shares of its Common Stock, and preferred
shares convertible into 16,676,942 shares of its Common Stock,
which options and preferred shares were deemed to be antidilutive
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2015, the Company had outstanding options
exercisable for 2,452,000 shares of its Common Stock, and preferred
shares convertible into 16,676,972 shares of its Common Stock,
which options and preferred shares were deemed to be antidilutive
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Fair Value.    The
Company has adopted ASC Topic 820, "  Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures  " for both
financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities.  The
Company has not elected the fair value option for any of its assets
or liabilities.  

Use of Estimates.    The accompanying financial statements are prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, and include certain estimates and
assumptions, which affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  Accordingly, actual results may differ from
those estimates.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  .  

Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements in
the current period and identified no pronouncements that would have
an impact on our financial statements.

4.           INVESTMENTS 

In May 2006, the Company purchased 144,024 shares of common stock
of Genomics USA, Inc. (   GUSA   ) for $200,000. After the investment,
QuantRx owned approximately 5% of the total issued and outstanding
common stock of GUSA. As of the end of September 30, 2016, the
Company s position had been diluted to approximately 
 5%   of the issued and outstanding common stock of
GUSA.  The investment is recorded at historical cost and
is assessed at least annually for impairment.  Genomics
USA, Inc. now does business as GMS Biotech.  

5.           INTANGIBLE
ASSETS 

Intangible assets as of the balance sheet dates consisted
of the following: 

The Company s intangible assets consist of patents, licensed
patents and patent rights, are carried at the legal cost to obtain
them. Costs to renew or extend the term of intangible assets are
expensed when incurred. In 2008, through our formerly majority
owned subsidiary, the Company also held technology licenses and
other acquired intangibles. Intangible assets are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. Useful
lives are as follows:

Categories  

Estimated Useful Life in Years 

Patents 

17    

Patents
under licensing 

10    

Intangibles
acquired in 2008 (weighted average) 

15    

Amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 totaled $5,182 and $6,429, respectively. 

Patent under Licensing 

The Company licenses patent rights and know-how for certain
hemorrhoid treatment pads and related coatings from The Procter
  Gamble Company. The five-year license agreement was entered
into July 2006 and has a five-year automatic renewal
option.  Although the Company renewed the agreement in
2011, payments have been suspended due to the Company s
current financial condition.  The Company has
subsequently filed for a patent to address the technology used in
its treated miniforms, which was issued during 2015. 

6.           CONVERTIBLE
NOTES PAYABLE 

2012 Notes and 2013 Notes.   In May 2012, in consideration for the extension of
certain promissory notes originally due and payable on March 31,
2012 (the    2012 Notes   ) to June 30, 2012, the Company assigned to
the holders of the 2012 Notes FPMI Warrants to purchase a total of
113,127 shares of FPMI common stock for $0.50 per share
(the    $0.50 FPMI
Warrants   ).  In
August 2012, in consideration for the extension of the maturity
date of the 2012 Notes to November 15, 2012, the Company agreed to
assign a total of 155,877 $0.50 FPMI Warrants to the holders of the
2012 Notes.  As a result, a total of 260,508 $0.50 FPMI
Warrants have been assigned to holders of 2012
Notes.  

-7- 

Table of Contents  

Between August 2012 and July 2013, the Company issued promissory
notes in the aggregate principal amount of $114,000 (the
   2013
Notes   ). As additional
consideration for the 2013 Notes, the Company issued an aggregate
total of 200,000 shares of Common Stock, 8,496 $0.50 FPMI Warrants
and 64,000 FPMI Warrants exercisable for $1.00 per
share.   

The 2012 and 2013 Notes accrue interest at the rate of 6% annually
prior to maturity, and 12% annually thereafter. All 2012 Notes and
2013 Notes have matured and are currently due and payable on
demand. The 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes are convertible at the option
of each respective holder into shares of Common Stock at a
conversion price equal to $0.10 per share. In addition, the holders
may exchange the 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes for Common Stock in the
event the Company consummates a qualified financing (the
   Qualified
Financing   ), which is
defined in the 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes as a financing resulting
in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $500,000. While the
Company intends to pay the 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes using proceeds
from a Qualified Financing, such Qualified Financing may not occur
prior to the date the holders of the 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes
demand repayment.  

In connection with the issuance of the 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes,

Bridge Notes.    In
July 2014, the Company s Board of Directors approved of a
private offering of convertible promissory demand notes (the
   Bridge
Notes   ) to certain
accredited investors in the aggregate principal amount of up to
$500,000. As additional consideration for the purchase of the
Bridge Notes, the Board approved of the issuance of 200,000 shares
of the Company s Common Stock to participating investors for
every $100,000 invested.  

Each Bridge Note accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum,
payable in either cash or shares of the Company s Common
Stock. The Bridge Notes matured on December 31, 2015, and are
currently due and payable on demand. Each Bridge Note is
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into that number
of shares of Common Stock equal to the outstanding principal
balance of the Bridge Note, plus accrued but unpaid interest (the
   Outstanding
Balance   ), divided by
$0.08 (the    Conversion
Shares   ). Additionally,
in the event the Company completes an equity or equity-linked
financing with gross proceeds to the Company of at least $1.5
million (a    Qualified
Financing   ), the
Outstanding Balance of all Bridge Notes will, at the discretion of
each respective holder, either (i) convert into securities sold in
the Qualified Financing, or (ii) automatically convert into
Conversion Shares.  

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company issued Bridge
Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $386,000. As additional
consideration for the purchase of the Bridge Notes, the Company

expenses related to the beneficial conversion feature in the amount
of $35,944 and $48,444, respectively.  The Company will
amortize these amounts over the life of the debt and, accordingly,
recorded interest expense related to the debt discount and
beneficial conversion feature in the amount of $26,958, and
$36,333, respectively.  The Company also incurred $46,000
of costs related to issuance of the Bridge Notes, which were
amortized over the life of the debt.  Total issuance
costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014 amounted

strategy; and private or public sector demand for products and
services similar to what we plan to commercialize.  We
disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly announce the
results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements

Overview 

We have developed and are working towards commercializing our
patented miniform pads (   PADs   )
and PAD based over-the-counter products for the treatment of
hemorrhoids, minor vaginal infection, urinary incontinence, general
catamenial uses and other medical needs. We are also developing and
intend to commercialize genomic diagnostics for the laboratory
market, based on our patented PadKit  technology.  Our
platforms include: inSync , Unique , PadKit , and
OEM branded over-the-counter and laboratory testing products based
on the Company s core intellectual property related to its
PAD technology.  

The continuation of our operations remain contingent on the receipt
of financing required to execute our business and operating plan,
which is currently focused on the commercialization of our PAD
technology either directly or through a joint venture, or other
relationship intended to increase shareholder value.  In the
interim, we have nominal operations, focused principally on
maintaining our intellectual property portfolio and continuing to
comply with the public company reporting requirements. No
assurances can be given that we will obtain financing, or otherwise
successfully develop a business and operating plan or enter into an
alternative relationship to commercialize our PAD
technology. 

Our diagnostic testing business, operating under our subsidiary QX
Labs, Inc. (   QX   ) (the    Diagnostic
Business   ) is based
principally on the Company s proprietary PadKit 
technology, which we believe provides a patented platform
technology for genomic diagnostics, including fetal genomics.
Outside of the Diagnostic Business, our business line consists of
our over-the-counter business, including the InSync feminine
hygienic interlabial pad, the Unique  Miniform for hemorrhoid
application, and other treated miniforms (the
   OTC
Business   ), as well as
established and continuing licensing relationships related to the
OTC Business. Management believes this corporate structure permits
the Company to more efficiently explore options to maximize the
value of the Diagnostics Business and the OTC Business
(collectively, the    Businesses   ), with the objective of maximizing the
value of the Businesses for the benefit of the Company and its
stakeholders.  

Our current focus is to obtain additional working capital necessary
to continue as a going concern, and develop a longer term financing
and operating plan to: (i) leverage our broad-based intellectual
property and patent portfolio to develop new and innovative
diagnostic products; (ii) commercialize our OTC Business and
Diagnostics Business either directly or through joint ventures,
mergers or similar transactions intended to capitalize on
commercial opportunities presented by each of the Businesses; (iii)
contract manufacturing to third parties while maintaining control
over the manufacturing process; and (iv) maximize the value of our
investments in non-core assets.  However, as a result of
our current financial condition, our efforts in the short-term will
be focused on obtaining financing necessary to continue as a going
concern. 

The following discussion of our financial condition should be read
together with our financial statements and related notes included
in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on April 13,
2016. 

Recent Developments 

Global Cancer Diagnostic, Inc. Letter of Intent  . On September 3, 2015, we entered into a
non-binding letter of intent (the    Global LOI   ) with Global Cancer Diagnostics, Inc., a
privately held laboratory in Tempe, Arizona
(   Global   ), for a proposed business combination. The
Global LOI had an original termination date of October 31, 2015
(the    Termination
Date   ), but could be
terminated or extended anytime by the mutual written consent of the
parties.  

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the executed Global LOI, the Company
deemed the Global LOI terminated. Accordingly, Global is obligated
to issue to us a number of shares of Global s common stock
equal to 10% of its then outstanding shares of common stock, on a
fully-diluted basis, as payment of the Global Advance. In addition
to the share issuance, the Company is evaluating certain additional
remedies related to the Global LOI and the $50,000 advance. The
Company has deemed the $50,000 Global Advance to be fully impaired
as of September 30, 2016.

Consolidated Results of Operations 

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30,
2016 to the Three and Nine Months Ended September
30,     2015  

The Company did not generate any revenue during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   Total revenue for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was $0 and $156, respectively.
   The absence of revenue
during the 2016 period is due to no royalty revenue attributable to
the Company s PAD technology received during the 2016
period.  Management does not anticipate that the Company will
generate any revenue until such time as the Company
develops a plan to commercialize its products, which is contingent
on the receipt of financing.  

Sales, general and administrative expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $13,319 and $52,999,
respectively. Sales, general and administrative expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $53,049 and
$170,322, respectively.   The decrease in sales,
general and administrative expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 is principally attributable to the non-cash,
non-reccurring stock compensation expense of $86,000 in the 2015
period, and lower costs for maintaining our intellectual property
portfolio in the 2016 period, as compared to the 2015
period.  

Professional fees for the three months ended September 31, 2016 and
2015 were $12,422 and $19,830, respectively. Professional fees for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $47,977 and
$96,652, respectively.  Professional fees include the
costs of legal, consulting and auditing services provided to
us.    The decrease in
professional fees for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 is directly related to lower overall costs for
professional services, including lower non-cash expenses for stock
based compensation paid to a consultant, lower general management
fees and lower costs of legal, accounting, consulting, and
financial services during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in
2015.   

The Company did not incur any research and development costs
during   the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016. Research and development costs for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $0 and
$13,154, respectively.   The Company did not
engage in any research and development efforts in the 2016 period,
nor does the Company expect to engage in any research and
development activity and until funding is secured and we develop a
plan to commercialize its products.  

Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, was $55,738 and $23,243, respectively.  Interest
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was
$157,716 and $92,207 respectively.   The increase in
interest expense in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period, is
related to a higher balance of outstanding notes payable and higher
interest rate calculated using the default interest rate during the
2016 period.  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company recorded non-cash interest expense related to the
amortization of debt discount on notes payable of $0 and $11,335,
respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt
discount on notes payable was $0 and $26,149,
respectively.    

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company recorded a gain on the issuance of Common Stock in exchange
of accrued interest payable on notes payable in the amount of
$16,503 and $0, respectively. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a gain on the
issuance of Common Stock in exchange of accrued interest on notes
payable in the amount of $16,503 and $35,700,
respectively. 

The Company s net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $116,143 compared to net loss for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 of   $109,824.  This
increase is primarily attributable to an increase in interest
expense in the 2016 period. Included in the Net Loss for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is a non-cash loss of
$50,000 due to an impairment of an asset during the quarter. 
 Net loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $297,702 compared to net loss for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 of $377,040.   The decrease in net
losses in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016, when
compared to the same period in 2015 is due to lower expenses,
including lower professional fees and sales, general and
administrative expense, as discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
$7,156, as compared to $61,078 at December 31, 2015. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $67,960 for
operating activities, compared to $204,671 used during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had
$14,038 provided by financing activities, as compared to $120,558
provided by during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
overall net decrease in cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable
the lack of financing activities during the quarter. 

The Company has not generated sufficient revenues from operations
to meet its operating expenses. In addition, the Company will
require additional funding to complete the development and launch
of its products, or to otherwise capitalize on its PAD technology.
The Company has historically financed its operations primarily
through issuances of equity and the proceeds of debt instruments.
In the past, the Company has also provided for its cash needs by
issuing Common Stock, options and warrants for certain operating
costs, including consulting and professional fees. 

Management believes that given the current economic environment and
the continuing need to strengthen our cash position, there is
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We are pursuing various funding options, including licensing
opportunities and the sale of investment holdings, as well other
financing transactions, to obtain additional funding to continue
the development of our products and bring them to commercial
markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
our efforts. Should we be unable to raise adequate financing or
generate sufficient revenue in the future, the Company s
business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition
would be materially and adversely harmed. 

The Company believes that the ability of the Company to recommence
operations, and therefore continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to do any or all of the
following:  

obtain adequate sources of funding to pay operating expenses and
fund long-term business operations; 

enter into a licensing or other relationship that allows the
Company to commercialize its products; 

manage or control working capital requirements by reducing
operating expenses; and 

develop new and enhance existing relationships with product
distributors and other points of distribution for the
Company s products. 

There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in
achieving its short- or long-term plans as set forth above, or that
such plans, if consummated, will enable the Company to obtain
profitable operations or continue in the long-term as a going
concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated
entities in which we have financial guarantees, subordinated
retained interests, derivative instruments or other contingent
arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks,
contingent liabilities or any other obligations under a variable
interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with
financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk
support. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin Topic 13 when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists and delivery has occurred, provided the fee is
fixed or determinable and collection is probable. The Company
assesses whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the
payment terms associated with the transaction. If a fee is based
upon a variable such as acceptance by the customer, the Company
accounts for the fee as not being fixed and determinable. In these
cases, the Company defers revenue and recognizes it when it becomes
due and payable. Up-front engagement fees are recorded as deferred
revenue and amortized to income on a straight-line basis over the
term of the agreement, although the fee is due and payable at the
time the agreement is signed or upon annual renewal. Payments
related to substantive, performance-based milestones in an
agreement are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the
milestones as specified in the underlying agreement when they
represent the culmination of the earnings process. 

-15- 

Table of Contents  

The Company assesses the probability of collection based on a
number of factors, including past transaction history with the
customer and the current financial condition of the customer. If
the Company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably
assured, revenue is deferred until the time collection becomes
reasonably assured. Significant management judgment and estimates
must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in
any accounting period. Material differences may result in the
amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management
made different judgments or utilized different
estimates. 

The Company recognizes revenue from nonrefundable minimum royalty
agreements from distributors or resellers upon delivery of product
to the distributor or reseller, provided no significant obligations
remain outstanding, the fee is fixed and determinable, and
collection is probable. Once minimum royalties have been received,
additional royalties are recognized as revenue when earned based on
the distributor s contractual reporting obligations. The
Company is able to recognize minimum royalty payments on an accrual
basis, as they are specified in the contract. However, since the
Company cannot forecast product sales by licensees, royalty
payments that are based on product sales by the licensees are not
determinable until the licensee has completed their computation of
the royalties due and/or remitted their cash payment to us. Should
information on licensee product sales become available so as to
enable the Company to recognize royalty revenue on an accrual
basis, materially different revenues and results of operations
could occur. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
The accounting policies discussed below are considered by
management to be the most important to the Company s
financial condition and results of operations, and require
management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments due
to the inherent uncertainty associated with these matters. All
significant estimates and assumptions are developed based on the
best information available to us at the time made and are regularly
reviewed and adjusted when necessary. We believe that our estimates
and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances. However,
actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions.
Additional information on significant accounting principles is
provided in Note 3 of the attached financial
statements. 

Impairment of Assets 

We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including our other
intangible assets, at least annually or whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be
recoverable. The determination of related estimated useful lives
and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant
judgments, related primarily to the future profitability and/or
future value of the assets. Changes in our strategic plan and/or
market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and
could require adjustments to recorded asset balances. We hold
investments in companies having operations or technologies in areas
which are within or adjacent to our strategic focus when acquired,
all of which are privately held and whose values are difficult to
determine. We record an investment impairment charge if we believe
an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than
temporary. Future changes in our strategic direction, adverse
changes in market conditions or poor operating results of
underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to
recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be
reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby
possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company determined the
Global Advance in the amount of $50,000 to be fully
impaired. 

In determining fair value of assets, the Company bases estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of
assets that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
fair value may differ from management estimates resulting in
potential impairments causing material changes to certain assets
and results of operations. 

Share-Based Payments 

We grant options to purchase our Common Stock to our employees and
directors under our stock option plan. We estimate the value of
stock option awards on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
pricing model (Black-Scholes model). The determination of the fair
value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables.
These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock
price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected
employee stock option exercise behaviors, and risk-free interest
rate. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in
future periods, the compensation expense that we record may differ
significantly from what we have recorded in the current
period. 

-16- 

Table of Contents  

We determine the fair value of the share-based compensation awards
granted to non-employees as either the fair value of the
consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments
issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of
the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the
stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of
either of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the
counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (ii) the
date at which the counterparty s performance is
complete. 

Estimates of share-based compensation expenses are significant to
our financial statements, but these expenses are based on option
valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by
us. 

The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all
of our accounting policies. In most cases, the accounting treatment
of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Deferred Taxes 

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
tax bases of assets and liabilities, which requires management to
perform estimates of future transactions and their respective
valuations. We review our deferred tax assets for recoverability
and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
that the Company will not realize the benefit of the net deferred
tax asset. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a valuation
allowance has been established. The likelihood of a material change
in the valuation allowance depends on our ability to generate
sufficient future taxable income. In the future, if management
determines that the likelihood exists to utilize the
Company s deferred tax assets, a reduction of the valuation
allowance could materially increase the Company s net
deferred tax asset. 

ITE M  4.  Controls
and Procedures 

(a)    Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the    Exchange
Act   ), as of September
30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, and in light of the previously
disclosed material weaknesses in internal controls over financial
reporting, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, who also
serves as its Principal Financial Officer, concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective.  

(b)    Changes in internal controls over financial reporting.  

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal year that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. There has been no
progress towards remediating our previously disclosed material
weakness due to the lack of funding.   In addition, as a
result of the death of our Chief Scientific Officer, any progress
toward remediating our material weaknesses will continue to be
delayed.

We will incur significant costs to ensure compliance with corporate
governance, federal securities law and accounting
requirements. 

We are subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of
the federal securities laws, rules and regulations.  We
have incurred and will incur significant costs to comply with such
requirements, including accounting and related auditing costs, and
costs to comply with corporate governance and other costs of
operating a public company. The filing and internal control
reporting requirements imposed by federal securities laws, rules
and regulations are rigorous and we may not be able to meet
them.  Any failure to comply or adequately comply with
federal securities laws, rules or regulations could subject us to
fines or regulatory actions, which may materially adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial
condition.
