1.     Basis of Presentation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements are comprised of the accounts of Investors Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly owned 
  subsidiaries, including Investors Bank (the  Bank ) and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ).  In the opinion of management, all the adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial condition and the consolidated results of operations for the unaudited periods presented have been included. The results of operations and other data presented for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for subsequent periods or the full year results. 
       
  Certain information and note disclosures usually included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for the preparation of the Form 10-Q. The consolidated financial statements presented should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s   December 31, 2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to current year presentation. 

2.     Stock Transactions 
  Stock Repurchase Programs 
  Under applicable federal regulations, the Company was not permitted to implement a stock repurchase program during the first year following completion of the second-step conversion without prior notice to, and the receipt of a non-objection from the Federal Reserve Board.  On March 16, 2015, the Company announced it had received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to commence a   5%   buyback program prior to the one-year anniversary of the completion of its second step conversion.  Accordingly, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of   17,911,561   shares.  The first program was completed on June 30, 2015.   
  On June 9, 2015, the Company announced its second share repurchase program, which authorized the purchase of an additional   10%   of its publicly-held outstanding shares of common stock, or   34,779,211   shares. The second repurchase program commenced immediately upon completion of the first repurchase plan on June 30, 2015.  The second program was completed on June 17, 2016.   
  On April 28, 2016, the Company announced its third share repurchase program, which authorized the purchase of an additional   10%   of its publicly-held outstanding shares of common stock, or   31,481,189   shares. The new repurchase program commenced immediately upon completion of the second repurchase plan on June 17, 2016.   
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company purchased   29,184,897   shares at a cost of   $337.5 million  , or approximately   $11.56   per share.   

3.      Business Combinations  
  On May 3, 2016, the Company announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with The Bank of Princeton. Under the terms of the merger agreement,   60%   of the common shares of Princeton Bank will be converted into the Company's common stock and the remaining   40%   will be exchanged for cash.  The Bank of Princeton shareholders will have the option to receive either   2.633   shares of the Company's common stock or   $30.75   in cash for each share of The Bank of Princeton common stock, subject to proration to ensure that, in the aggregate,   60%   of The Bank of Princeton's shares will be converted into the Company's common stock. As of June 30, 2016, The Bank of Princeton had assets of   $1.0 billion  , loans of   $809 million   and deposits of   $812 million   and operated   10   branches in New Jersey and   3   in the Philadelphia market.  The merger agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of each company.  Conditions required to be completed for this transaction include The Bank of Princeton shareholder approval, regulatory approvals, the effectiveness of the registration statement to be filed by the Company with respect to the stock exchanged to be issued in the transaction and other customary closing conditions.  As the merger has not been completed, the transaction is not reflected in the balance sheet or results of operation for the periods presented in this document.

4.      Earnings Per Share 
  The following is a summary of our earnings per share calculations and reconciliation of basic to diluted earnings per share. 

(1)  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   16,372,523   and   11,604,284   equity awards, respectively, that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented. 

(1)  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   11,819,014   and   18,454,117   equity awards, respectively, that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented.

5.     Securities 
    
  The following tables present the carrying value, gross unrealized gains and losses and estimated fair value for available-for-sale securities and the amortized cost, net unrealized losses, carrying value, gross unrecognized gains and losses and estimated fair value for held-to-maturity securities as of the dates indicated: 

(1)  Net unrealized losses of held-to-maturity corporate and other debt securities represent the other than temporary charge related to other non-credit factors and is being amortized through accumulated other comprehensive income over the remaining life of the securities.  For mortgage-backed securities, it represents the net loss on previously designated available-for sale securities transferred  to held-to-maturity at fair value and is being amortized through accumulated other comprehensive income over the remaining life of the securities. 
  (2)  Unrecognized gains and losses of held-to-maturity securities are not reflected in the financial statements, as they represent fair value fluctuations from the later of:  (i) the date a security is designated as held-to-maturity; or (ii) the date that an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized on a held-to-maturity security, through the date of the balance sheet.

   At   September 30, 2016  , corporate and other debt securities include a portfolio of collateralized debt obligations backed by pooled trust preferred securities ("TruPS"), principally issued by banks and to a lesser extent insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, and collateralized debt obligations.  At   September 30, 2016   the TruPS had an amortized cost and estimated fair value of   $38.1 million   and   $75.8 million  , respectively.  While all were investment grade at purchase, securities classified as non-investment grade at   September 30, 2016   had an amortized cost and estimated fair value of    $36.1 million   and   $69.5 million  , respectively.  Fair value is derived from considering specific assumptions, including terms of the TruPS structure, events of deferrals, defaults and liquidations, the projected cashflow for principal and interest payments, and discounted cash flow modeling.

Approximately   $480.0 million   of the Company s securities are pledged to secure borrowings.  The contractual maturities of the Bank's mortgage-backed securities are generally less than   20   years with effective lives expected to be shorter due to prepayments. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to underlying loan prepayments or early call privileges of the issuer, therefore, mortgage-backed securities are not included in the following table. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below.    

Gross unrealized losses on securities and the estimated fair value of the related securities, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was as follows:

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016  , gross unrealized losses relate to our mortgage-backed-security portfolio which is comprised of securities issued by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises. The fair values of these securities have been negatively impacted by the recent increase in intermediate-term market interest rates. 
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment ( OTTI ) 
  We conduct a quarterly review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its cost or amortized cost, and whether such decline is other-than-temporary. If a determination is made that a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company will estimate the amount of the unrealized loss that is attributable to credit and all other non-credit related factors. The credit related component will be recognized as an other-than-temporary impairment charge in non-interest income. The non-credit related component will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. 
  With the assistance of a valuation specialist, we evaluate the credit and performance of each issuer underlying our pooled trust preferred securities.  Cash flows for each security are forecast using assumptions for defaults, recoveries, pre-payments and amortization.  At   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , management deemed that the present value of projected cash flows for each security was greater than the book value and did not recognize any additional OTTI charges for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , non-credit related OTTI recorded on the previously impaired pooled trust preferred securities was   $22.1 million   (  $13.1 million   after-tax.)  This amount is being accreted into income over the estimated remaining life of the securities.

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents the changes in the credit loss component of the impairment loss of debt securities that the Company has written down for such loss as an other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings. 

The credit loss component of the impairment loss represents the difference between the present value of expected future cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the securities prior to considering credit losses. The beginning balance represents the credit loss component for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment occurred prior to the period presented. If other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings for credit impaired debt securities, they would be presented as additions based upon whether the current period is the first time a debt security was credit impaired (initial credit impairment) or is not the first time a debt security was credit impaired (subsequent credit impairments). The credit loss component is reduced if the Company sells, intends to sell or believes it will be required to sell previously credit impaired debt securities. Additionally, the credit loss component is reduced if (i) the Company receives cash flows in excess of what it expected to receive over the remaining life of the credit impaired debt security, (ii) the security matures or (iii) the security is fully written down. 
  Realized Gains and Losses 
       
  Gains and losses on the sale of all securities are determined using the specific identification method.  For the  three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received sale proceeds of   $122,200   on an equity security from the available-for-sale portfolio resulting in a gross realized gain of   $72,200  .  For the    nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received sale proceeds of   $57.9 million   on equity securities and pools of mortgage-backed securities sold from the available-for-sale portfolio resulting in a gross realized gain of   $2.3 million  .   
    
  There were   no   proceeds from sales from this portfolio for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company received sale proceeds of   $14.3 million   on a pool of mortgage-backed securities from the held-to-maturity portfolio resulting in a gross realized gain of   $836,000  .  These securities met the criteria of principal pay downs under 85% of the original investment amount and therefore did not result in a tainting of the held-to-maturity portfolio. The Company sells securities when, in management s assessment market pricing presents an economic benefit that outweighs holding such securities, and when securities with smaller balance become cost prohibitive to carry. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company received proceeds of   $2.6 million   on an equity security from the available-for-sale portfolio resulting in a gross realized gain of    $1.5 million  .  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized gains on available-for-sale securities of   $42,000   and   $126,000  , respectively, which were related to capital distributions of equity securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , there were   no   sales of securities from the held-to-maturity portfolio; however, the Company recognized a loss of   $646,000   on a TruP security which was liquidated by its Trustee.

6.    Loans Receivable, Net 
  The detail of the loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

(1) Included in unamortized premiums and deferred loan costs are accretable purchase accounting adjustments in connection with loans acquired.   
    
  Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans 
  Purchased Credit-Impaired ("PCI") loans, are loans acquired at a discount that is due, in part, to credit quality. PCI loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30 and are initially recorded at fair value as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows with no valuation allowance reflected in the allowance for loan losses. 
    
  The following table presents changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

(1)    Reclassifications of the non-accretable difference to the accretable yield may occur subsequent to the loan acquisition dates due to increases in expected cash flows of the loans

     Table of Contents  

An analysis of the allowance for loan losses is summarized as follows: 

The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses that is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we make significant estimates and therefore, have identified the allowance as a critical accounting policy. The methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses. 
  The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, under which we are required to maintain an allowance for probable losses at the balance sheet date. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable. Loans acquired are marked to fair value on the date of acquisition with no valuation allowance reflected in the allowance for loan losses.  In conjunction with the quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss, the Company performs an analysis on acquired loans to determine whether or not there has been subsequent deterioration in relation to those loans.  If deterioration has occurred, the Company will include these loans in their calculation of the allowance for loan loss.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded charge-offs of   $48,000   related to PCI loans acquired. 
  Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The analysis of the allowance for loan losses has two components: specific and general allocations. Specific allocations are made for loans determined to be impaired. A loan is deemed to be impaired if it is a commercial loan with an outstanding balance greater than   $1.0 million   and on non-accrual status, loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ), and other commercial loans greater than   $1.0 million   if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. The general allocation is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk rating (if applicable) and payment history. In addition, the Company's residential portfolio is subdivided between fixed and adjustable rate loans as adjustable rate loans are deemed to be subject to more credit risk if interest rates rise.  The loss factors used are based on the Company's historical loss experience over a look-back period determined to provide the appropriate amount of data to accurately estimate expected losses as of period end.  Additionally, management assesses the loss emergence period for the expected losses of each loan segment and adjusts each historical loss factor accordingly.  The loss emergence period is the estimated time from the date of a loss event (such as a personal bankruptcy) to the actual recognition of the loss (typically via the first full or partial loan charge-off), and is determined based upon a study of the Company's past loss experience by loan segment. The loss factors may also be adjusted to account for qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio to differ from historical loss experience.  This evaluation is based on among other things, loan and delinquency trends, general economic conditions, geographic concentrations, lending policies and procedures and industry and peer comparisons, but is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions based upon changes in economic and real estate market conditions. Actual loan losses may be different than the allowance for loan losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results. 
  On a quarterly basis, management reviews the current status of various loan assets in order to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In this evaluation process, specific loans are analyzed to determine their potential risk of loss. Loans determined to be impaired are evaluated for potential loss exposure. Any shortfall results in a recommendation of a specific allowance or charge-off if the likelihood of loss is evaluated as probable. To determine the adequacy of collateral on a particular loan, an estimate of the fair value of the collateral is based on the most current appraised value available for real property or a discounted cash flow analysis on a business. This appraised value for real property is then reduced to reflect estimated liquidation expenses.

The allowance contains reserves identified as unallocated.  These reserves reflect management's attempt to ensure that the overall allowance reflects a margin for imprecision and the uncertainty that is inherent in estimates of probable credit losses.  
  Our lending emphasis has been the origination of commercial real estate loans, multi-family loans, commercial and industrial loans and the origination and purchase of residential mortgage loans. We also originate home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. These activities resulted in a concentration of loans secured by real estate property and businesses located in New Jersey and New York. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks to our loan portfolio are increases in interest rates, a decline in the general economy, and declines in real estate market values in New Jersey, New York and surrounding states. Any one or combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of loan loss provisions.  As a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans.  Assumptions for appraisal valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Negative changes to appraisal assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The assumptions supporting such appraisals are carefully reviewed to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans. 
  For commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, the Company obtains an appraisal for all collateral dependent loans upon origination.  An updated appraisal is obtained annually for loans rated substandard or worse with a balance of   $500,000   or greater.  An updated appraisal is obtained biennially for loans rated special mention with a balance of   $2.0 million   or greater.  This is done in order to determine the specific reserve or charge off needed.  As part of the allowance for loan loss process, the Company reviews each collateral dependent commercial real estate loan classified as non-accrual and/or impaired and assesses whether there has been an adverse change in the collateral value supporting the loan. The Company utilizes information from its commercial lending officers and its credit department and loan workout department s knowledge of changes in real estate conditions in our lending area to identify if possible deterioration of collateral value has occurred. Based on the severity of the changes in market conditions, management determines if an updated appraisal is warranted or if downward adjustments to the previous appraisal are warranted. If it is determined that the deterioration of the collateral value is significant enough to warrant ordering a new appraisal, an estimate of the downward adjustments to the existing appraised value is used in assessing if additional specific reserves are necessary until the updated appraisal is received. 
  For homogeneous residential mortgage loans, the Company s policy is to obtain an appraisal upon the origination of the loan and an updated appraisal in the event a loan becomes   90   days delinquent. Thereafter, the appraisal is updated every   two   years if the loan remains in non-performing status and the foreclosure process has not been completed. Management adjusts the appraised value of residential loans to reflect estimated selling costs and declines in the real estate market. 
  Management believes the potential risk for outdated appraisals for impaired and other non-performing loans has been mitigated due to the fact that the loans are individually assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral. Loans are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collectability of the full principal balance is in doubt. 
  Although we believe we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if the current economic environment deteriorates. Management uses relevant information available; however, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, as an integral part of their examination process, will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.

The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. For non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate loans the Company analyzes the loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk and assesses the probability of collection for each type of class. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
  Pass -    Pass  assets are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner. 
  Watch -    A "Watch" asset has all the characteristics of a Pass asset but warrant more than the normal level of supervision. These loans may require more detailed reporting to management because some aspects of underwriting may not conform to policy or adverse

events may have affected or could affect the cash flow or ability to continue operating profitably, provided, however, the events do not constitute an undue credit risk.  Residential loans delinquent   30  -  59   days are considered watch if not already identified as impaired. 
  Special Mention   - A  Special Mention  asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. Special Mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Residential loans delinquent   60  -  89   days are considered special mention if not already identified as impaired. 
  Substandard   - A  Substandard  asset is inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Residential loans delinquent   90   days or greater as well as those identified as impaired are considered substandard. 
  Doubtful   - An asset classified  Doubtful  has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently known facts, conditions, and values. 
  Loss   - An asset or portion thereof, classified  Loss  is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance on the institution s books as an asset, without establishment of a specific valuation allowance or charge-off, is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily mean that an asset has no recovery or salvage value; but rather, there is much doubt about whether, how much, or when the recovery will occur. As such, it is not practical or desirable to defer the write-off. 
  The following tables present the risk category of loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   by class of loans, excluding  PCI loans:

Included in the non-accrual table above are troubled debt restructured ("TDR") loans whose payment status is current but the Company has classified as non-accrual as the loans have not maintained their current payment status for   six   consecutive months under the restructured terms and therefore do not meet the criteria for accrual status. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , these loans are comprised of the following: 

The following table presents TDR loans which were also 30-89 days delinquent and classified as non-accrual at the dates indicated: 

The Company has   no   loans past due   90   days or more delinquent that are still accruing interest.  
  PCI loans are excluded from non-accrual loans, as they are recorded at fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows.  As of   September 30, 2016  , PCI loans with a carrying value of   $10.5 million   included   $9.0 million   of which were current,   $71,000   of which were   30  -  89   days delinquent and   $1.4 million   of which were   90   days or more delinquent. As of   December 31, 2015  , PCI loans with a carrying value of   $11.1 million   included   $9.0 million   of which were current and   $2.1 million   of which were   90   days or more delinquent. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , loans meeting the Company s definition of an impaired loan were primarily collateral dependent loans which totaled   $33.0 million   and   $57.0 million  , respectively, with allocations of the allowance for loan losses of   $1.5 million   and   $4.2 million   for the periods ending   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest income received and recognized on these loans totaled   $1.0 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively.

  Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  On a case-by-case basis, the Company may agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower s loan to remain competitive and assist customers who may be experiencing financial difficulty, as well as preserve the Company s position in the loan. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been made at the time of such modification, the loan is classified as a TDR. 
  Substantially all of our TDR loan modifications involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan, or a combination of these two methods. These modifications rarely result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. In addition, we frequently obtain additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying commercial loans. Restructured loans remain on non-accrual status until there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible.

Post-modification recorded investment represents the net book balance immediately following modification.  
  All TDRs are impaired loans, which are individually evaluated for impairment, as discussed above. Collateral dependent impaired loans classified as TDRs were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral. There were   no   charge-offs for collateral dependant TDRs during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The allowance for loan losses associated with the TDRs presented in the above tables totaled   $1.5 million   and   $1.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Residential mortgage loan modifications primarily involved the reduction in loan interest rate and extension of loan maturity dates. All residential loans deemed to be TDRs were modified to reflect a reduction in interest rates to current market rates. Several residential TDRs include step up interest rates in their modified terms which will impact their weighted average yield in the future. Commercial loan modifications which qualified as a TDR comprised of terms of maturity being extended and reduction in interest rates to current market terms. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had an existing TDR commercial loan for which the Company extended an existing working capital line of credit, however that loan subsequently was paid off during the same time period.

Mortgage servicing rights are accounted for using the amortization method.  Under this method, the Company amortizes the loan servicing asset in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenues. The Company sells loans on a servicing-retained basis. Loans that were sold on this basis had an unpaid principal balance of   $2.01 billion   and   $2.12 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   respectively, all of which relate to residential mortgage loans. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the servicing asset, included in intangible assets, had an estimated fair value of   $15.2 million   and   $16.2 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , fair value was based on expected future cash flows considering a weighted average discount rate of   13.00%  , a weighted average constant prepayment rate on mortgages of   13.32%   and a weighted average life of   5.8 years  . Core deposit premiums are amortized using an accelerated method and having a weighted average amortization period of   10 years  . 

9.      Equity Incentive Plan 
    
  At the annual meeting held on June 9, 2015, stockholders of the Company approved the Investors Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("2015 Plan") which provides for the issuance or delivery of up to   30,881,296   shares (  13,234,841   restricted stock awards and   17,646,455   stock options) of Investors Bancorp, Inc. common stock.   
       
  Restricted shares granted under the 2015 Plan vest in equal installments, over the service period generally ranging from    5   to   7   years beginning   one   year from the date of grant.  Additionally, certain restricted shares awarded are performance vesting awards, which may or may not vest depending upon the attainment of certain corporate financial targets.  The vesting of restricted stock may accelerate in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Plan.  The product of the number of shares granted and the grant date closing market price of the Company's common stock determine the fair value of restricted shares under the 2015 Plan.  Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted shares on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   271,890    shares of restricted stock awards under the 2015 Plan.   
    
  Stock options granted under the 2015 Plan vest in equal installments, over the service period generally ranging from   5   to   7   years beginning one year from the date of grant.  The vesting of stock options may accelerate in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Plan.  Stock options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Company's common stock on the grant date based on the closing market price and have an expiration period of   10   years.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   201,440    stock options under the 2015 Plan.   
    
  The fair value of stock options granted as part of the 2015 Plan was estimated utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions for the period presented below.  

The weighted average expected life of the stock option represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding and is estimated using historical data of stock option exercises and forfeitures.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock.  The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair values of these awards, which have graded vesting, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards.

The Company applies ASC 718   "Compensation- Stock Compensation,"   ("ASC 718") and expenses the fair value of all share-based compensation granted over the requisite service periods.  ASC 718 requires the Company to report as a financing cash flow the benefits of realized tax deductions in excess of previously recognized tax benefits on compensation expense. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ( SAB 107 ), the Company classified share-based compensation for employees and outside directors within  compensation and fringe benefits  in the consolidated statements of income to correspond with the same line item as the cash compensation paid.

10.      Net Periodic Benefit Plan Expense 
  The Company has an Executive Supplemental Retirement Wage Replacement Plan ("Wage Replacement Plan") and the Supplemental ESOP and Retirement Plan ("Supplemental ESOP") (collectively, the "SERPs"). The Wage Replacement Plan is a  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

nonqualified, defined benefit plan which provides benefits to certain executives as designated by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. More specifically, the Wage Replacement Plan is designed to provide participants with a normal retirement benefit equal to an annual benefit of   60%   of the participant's highest annual base salary and cash inventive (over a consecutive 36-month period within the last 120 consecutive calendar months of employment) reduced by the sum of the benefits provided under the Pentagra DB Plan and the annualized value of their benefits payable under the defined benefit portion of the Supplemental ESOP. 
  The Supplemental ESOP compensates certain executives (as designated by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) participating in the Pentegra DB Plan and the ESOP whose contributions are limited by the Internal Revenue Code.   The Company also maintains the Amended and Restated Director Retirement Plan ("Directors' Plan") for certain directors, which is a nonqualified, defined benefit plan. This plan was frozen on November 21, 2006 such that no new benefits accrued under, and no new directors were eligible to participate in the plan. The Wage Replacement Plan, Supplemental ESOP and the Directors  Plan are unfunded and the costs of the plans are recognized over the period that services are provided. 
  The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows: 

Due to the unfunded nature of these plans, no contributions have been made or were expected to be made to the SERPs and Directors  Plan during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
  The Company also maintains a defined benefit pension plan. Since it is a multiemployer plan, costs of the pension plan are based on contributions required to be made to the pension plan.  There was   no   contribution to the defined benefit pension plan during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We anticipate contributing funds to the plan to meet any minimum funding requirements for the remainder of   2016  . 

11.    Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
    
  The Company uses various financial instruments, including derivatives, to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.  Certain derivatives are designated as hedging instruments in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship (fair value or cash flow hedge.) 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The Company s objective in using interest rate derivatives are to primarily reduce cost and add stability to interest expense in an effort to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of amounts subject to variability cuased by changes in interest rates from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.   
    
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with certain short term wholesale funding transactions. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not record any hedge ineffectiveness. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives would be recognized directly in earnings.  
    
  Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate borrowings. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional   $845,000   will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.

The tabular disclosure of fair value provides the location that derivative assets and liabilities are presented on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features  
    
  The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations and could be required to terminate its derivative positions with the counterparty.  
    
  The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the company fails to maintain its status as a well capitalized institution, then the Company could be required to terminate its derivative positions with the counterparty. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was   $1.1 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties and has posted collateral of   $6.0 million   against its obligations under these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at   September 30, 2016  , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value and would have been required to pay any additional amounts due in excess of amounts previously posted as collateral with the respective counterparty.

13.    Fair Value Measurements 
  We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Our securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other assets or liabilities on a non-recurring basis, such as held-to-maturity securities, mortgage servicing rights ( MSR ), loans receivable and real estate owned ( REO ). These non-recurring fair value adjustments

     Table of Contents  

involve the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Additionally, in connection with our mortgage banking activities we have commitments to fund loans held-for-sale and commitments to sell loans, which are considered free-standing derivative instruments, the fair values of which are not material to our financial condition or results of operations. 
  In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC 820,    Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   , we group our assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: 
             
    Level 1   Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 
                
    Level 2   Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 
                
    Level 3   Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. The results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. 
     We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 
  Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  Securities available-for-sale 
  Our available-for-sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value on a recurring basis, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss in stockholders  equity. The fair values of available-for-sale securities are based on quoted market prices (Level 1), where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded (Level 2), the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and non-binding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service. 
    
  Derivatives 
  The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on a valuation model that uses primarily observable inputs, such as benchmark yield curves and interest rate spreads.

The following tables provide the level of valuation assumptions used to determine the carrying value of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

There have been no changes in the methodologies used at   September 30, 2016   from   December 31, 2015  , and there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
  Mortgage Servicing Rights, Net 
  Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of MSR is obtained through independent third party valuations through an analysis of future cash flows, incorporating assumptions market participants would use in determining fair value including market discount rates, prepayment speeds, servicing income, servicing costs, default rates and other market driven data, including the market s perception of future interest rate movements. The prepayment speed and the discount rate are considered two of the most significant inputs in the model. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value model used prepayment speeds ranging from   2.59%   to   27.96%   and a discount rate of   13.00%   for the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights.  At   December 31, 2015  , the fair value model used prepayment speeds ranging from   6.30%   to   26.28%   and a discount rate of   10.20%   for the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights. A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing the mortgage servicing rights using Level 3 inputs. The use of different assumptions could have a significant positive or negative effect on the fair value estimate. 
    
  Impaired Loans Receivable 
  Loans which meet certain criteria are evaluated individually for impairment. A loan is deemed to be impaired if it is a commercial loan with an outstanding balance greater than   $1.0 million   and on non-accrual status, loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring, and other commercial loans with   $1.0 million   in outstanding principal if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Our impaired loans are generally collateral dependent and, as such, are carried at the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. In order to estimate fair value, once interest or principal payments are   90 days   delinquent or when the timely collection of such income is considered doubtful an updated appraisal is obtained. Thereafter, in the event the most recent appraisal does not reflect the current market conditions due to the passage of time and other factors, management will obtain an updated appraisal or make downward adjustments to the existing appraised value based on their knowledge of the property, local real estate market conditions, recent real estate transactions, and for estimated selling costs, if applicable. At   September 30, 2016  , appraisals were discounted in a range of   0%  -  25%   for estimated costs to sell. 
  Other Real Estate Owned 
  Other Real Estate Owned is recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs when acquired, thus establishing a new cost basis. Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals. These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets based on the appraisers  market knowledge and experience, and are discounted an additional   0%  -  25%   for estimated costs to sell. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. If the estimated fair value of the asset declines, a writedown is recorded through expense. The valuation of foreclosed assets is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in the future because of changes in economic conditions. Operating costs after acquisition are generally expensed.

The following tables provides the level of valuation assumptions used to determine the carrying value of our assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   there was no change to the carrying value of impaired loans measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , there was no change to carrying value of impaired loans or mortgage servicing rights measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.   

Other Fair Value Disclosures 
  Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions for the Company s financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are set forth below. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  For cash and due from banks, the carrying amount approximates fair value. 
  Securities Held-to-Maturity 
  Our held-to-maturity portfolio, consisting primarily of mortgage backed securities and other debt securities for which we have a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, is carried at amortized cost. Management utilizes various inputs to determine the fair value of the portfolio. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service, which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and non-binding broker quotes. In the absence of quoted prices and in an illiquid market, valuation techniques, which require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable, are used to determine fair value of the investment. Valuation techniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to forecasted cash flows, discount rates, rate of return, adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity, and liquidation values. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.

FHLB Stock 
  The fair value of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB") stock is its carrying value, since this is the amount for which it could be redeemed. There is no active market for this stock and the Bank is required to hold a minimum investment based upon the balance of mortgage related assets held by the member. 
  Loans Held For Sale  
  The fair value of loans held for sale is its carrying value, since this is the amount for which the Company intends to sell  it for.  The fair value is determined based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.   
  Loans 
  Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as residential mortgage and consumer. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and non-performing categories. 
  The fair value of performing loans, except residential mortgage loans, is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan. For performing residential mortgage loans, fair value is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayment estimates using discount rates based on secondary market sources adjusted to reflect differences in servicing and credit costs, if applicable. Fair value for significant non-performing loans is based on recent external appraisals of collateral securing such loans, adjusted for the timing of anticipated cash flows. Fair values estimated in this manner do not fully incorporate an exit price approach to fair value, but instead are based on a comparison to current market rates for comparable loans. 
  Deposit Liabilities 
  The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as savings, checking accounts and money market accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand. The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates which approximate currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
  Borrowings 
  The fair value of borrowings are based on securities dealers  estimated fair values, when available, or estimated using discounted contractual cash flows using rates which approximate the rates offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities.

Commitments to Extend Credit 
  The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For commitments to originate fixed rate loans, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. Due to the short-term nature of our outstanding commitments, the fair values of these commitments are immaterial to our financial condition. 
  The carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments are presented in the following table. 

Limitations 
  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

     Table of Contents  

Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance-sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets that are not considered financial assets include deferred tax assets, premises and equipment and bank owned life insurance. Liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits are not considered financial liabilities. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates. 

14.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ", a new standard which addresses diversity in practice related to eight specific cash flow issues:   debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies), distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities will apply the standard s provisions using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-15 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,    Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.    This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income. In issuing the standard, the FASB is responding to criticism that today s guidance delays recognition of credit losses. The standard will replace today s  incurred loss  approach with an  expected loss  model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale ( AFS ) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach). The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting",   a new standard that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The standard also allows entities to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on its cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   "Leases (Topic 842),"   which requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective approach must be applied for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period

presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,    Financial Instruments- Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  .   This amendment supersedes the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories, requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The amendment requires public business entities that are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet to measure that fair value using the exit price notion. The amendment requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option. The amendment requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The amendment reduces diversity in current practice by clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should apply the amendment by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with the exception of the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. The Company intends to adopt the accounting standard during the first quarter of 2018, as required, and is currently evaluating the impact on its results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  " The objective of this amendment is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are in the scope of other standards.  The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. Subsequently, the FASB issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU 2016-08,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations     ASU 2016-10,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing   ; ASU 2016-11,    Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting   ; and ASU 2016-12,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   . These amendments are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance of ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,    Business Combinations- Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments."    Under the new rules, acquirers no longer have to retrospectively adjust provisional amounts included in acquisition-date financial statements, when final facts and circumstances are not known on the acquisition date, and later become known in the measurement period. Instead, adjustments that are made in a later period are to be reported in that period. However, acquirers must disclose the amount of adjustments to current period income relating to amounts that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments were recognized as of the acquisition date.  For public business entities, the guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. This guidance did not have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,    Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.     The ASU changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. Under the ASU, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense.  According to the ASU s Basis for Conclusions, debt issuance costs incurred before the associated funding is received should be reported on the balance sheet as deferred charges until that debt liability amount is recorded.  For public business entities, the guidance in the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.   This guidance did not have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In April  2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-04,   "Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets."    The ASU gives an employer whose fiscal year-end does not coincide with a calendar month-end the ability, as a practical expedient, to measure defined benefit retirement obligations and related plan assets as of the month-end that is closest to its fiscal year-end.  The ASU also provides guidance on accounting for contributions to the plan and significant events that require a remeasurement that occur during the period between a month-end measurement date and the employer s fiscal year-end. An entity should reflect the effects of those contributions or significant events in the measurement of the retirement benefit obligations and related plan assets.  The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. This guidance did not have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

  As defined in FASB ASC 855, "  Subsequent Events  ", subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued.  Financial statements are considered issued when they are widely distributed to stockholders and other financial statement users for general use and reliance in a form and format that complies with GAAP. 
  On October 27, 2016, the Company declared a cash dividend of   $0.08   per share. The   $0.08   dividend per share will be paid to stockholders on November 23, 2016, with a record date of  November 10, 2016.

  Critical Accounting Policies 
  We consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or to make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies. 
  Allowance for Loan Losses.    The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses that is charged against income.   The methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management because of the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions used, and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses. 
  The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, under which we are required to maintain an allowance for probable losses at the balance sheet date. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable.  Loans acquired are marked to fair value on the date of acquisition with no valuation allowance reflected in the allowance for loan losses.  In conjunction with the quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss, the Company performs an analysis on acquired loans to determine whether or not there has been subsequent deterioration in relation to those loans. If deterioration has occurred, the Company will include these loans in their calculation of the allowance for loan loss.  
  Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The analysis of the allowance for loan losses has two components: specific and general allocations. Specific allocations are made for loans determined to be impaired. A loan is deemed to be impaired if it is a commercial loan with an outstanding balance greater than $1.0 million and on non-accrual status, loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"), and other commercial loans greater than $1.0 million if management has specific information that it is probable we will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. The general allocation is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk rating (if applicable) and payment history.  In addition, the Company's residential portfolio is subdivided between fixed and adjustable rate loans as adjustable rate loans are deemed to be subject to more credit risk if interest rates rise.  We also analyze historical loss experience using the appropriate look-back and loss emergence period.  The loss factors used are based on the Company's historical loss experience over a look-back period determined to provide  
  
   44 

     Table of Contents  

the appropriate amount of data to accurately estimate expected losses as of period end.  Additionally, management assesses the loss emergence period for the expected losses of each loan segment and adjusts each historical loss factor accordingly.  The loss emergence period is the estimated time from the date of a loss event (such as a personal bankruptcy) to the actual recognition of the loss (typically via the first full or partial loan charge-off), and is determined based upon a study of the Company's past loss experience by loan segment.  The loss factors may also be adjusted to account for qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio to differ from historical loss experience.  This evaluation is based on among other things, loan and delinquency trends, general economic conditions, geographic concentrations, lending policies and procedures and industry and peer comparisons, but is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions based upon changes in economic and real estate market conditions. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established, which could have a material negative effect on our financial results.  
  Purchased Credit-Impaired ("PCI") loans, are loans acquired at a discount due, in part, to credit quality. PCI loans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-30 and are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no valuation allowance (i.e., the allowance for loan losses). The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the initial carrying amount (fair value) of the PCI loans, or the  accretable yield,  is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of the loans. Contractually required payments for interest and principal that exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition, or the  non-accretable difference,  are not recognized as a yield adjustment, as a loss accrual or a valuation allowance. Reclassifications of the non-accretable difference to the accretable yield may occur subsequent to the loan acquisition dates due to increases in expected cash flows of the loans and would result in an increase in yield on a prospective basis. The Company analyzes the actual cash flow versus the forecasts and any adjustments to credit loss expectations are made based on actual loss recognized as well as changes in the probability of default. For a period in which cash flows aren't reforecasted, prior period's estimated cash flows are adjusted to reflect the actual cash received and credit events that occurred during the current reporting period.  
  On a quarterly basis, management reviews the current status of various loan assets in order to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. In this evaluation process, specific loans are analyzed to determine their potential risk of loss. Loans determined to be impaired are evaluated for potential loss.  Any shortfall results in a recommendation of a charge-off or specific allowance if the likelihood of loss is evaluated as probable. To determine the adequacy of collateral on a particular loan, an estimate of the fair market value of the collateral is based on the most current appraised value for real property or a discounted cash flow analysis on a business.  This appraised value for real property is then reduced to reflect estimated liquidation expenses. Acquired loans are marked to fair value on the date of acquisition.  
  The allowance contains reserves identified as unallocated.  These reserves reflect management's attempt to ensure that the overall allowance reflects a margin for imprecision and the uncertainty that is inherent in estimates of probable credit losses.  
  Our lending emphasis has been the origination of commercial real estate loans, multi-family loans, commercial and industrial loans and the origination and purchase of residential mortgage loans. We also originate home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. These activities resulted in a concentration of loans secured by real estate property and businesses located in New Jersey and New York.  Based on the composition of our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks to our loan portfolio are increases in interest rates, a decline in the general economy, and declines in real estate market values in New Jersey, New York and surrounding states. Any one or combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of loan loss provisions. We consider it important to maintain the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans at an adequate level given current economic conditions and the composition of the portfolio.  As a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions for appraisal valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties.  Negative changes to appraisal assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The assumptions supporting such appraisals are carefully reviewed to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans. 
  For commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans, the Company obtains an appraisal for all collateral dependent loans upon origination.  An updated appraisal is obtained annually for loans rated substandard or worse with a balance of $500,000 or greater.  An updated appraisal is obtained biennially for loans rated special mention with a balance of $2.0 million or greater.  This is done in order to determine the specific reserve or charge off needed.  As part of the allowance for loan loss process, the Company reviews each collateral dependent commercial real estate loan classified as non-accrual and/or impaired and assesses whether there has been an adverse change in the collateral value supporting the loan. The Company utilizes information from its commercial lending officers and its credit department and loan workout department's knowledge of changes in real estate conditions in our lending area to identify if possible deterioration of collateral value has occurred. Based on the severity of the changes in market conditions, management determines if an updated appraisal is warranted or if downward adjustments to the previous appraisal are warranted. If it is determined that the deterioration of the collateral value is significant enough to warrant ordering  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

a new appraisal, an estimate of the downward adjustments to the existing appraised value is used in assessing if additional specific reserves are necessary until the updated appraisal is received.  
  For homogeneous residential mortgage loans, the Company's policy is to obtain an appraisal upon the origination of the loan and an updated appraisal in the event a loan becomes 90 days delinquent. Thereafter, the appraisal is updated every two years if the loan remains in non-performing status and the foreclosure process has not been completed. Management adjusts the appraised value of residential loans to reflect estimated selling costs and estimated declines in the real estate market.   
  Management believes the potential risk for outdated appraisals for impaired and other non-performing loans has been mitigated due to the fact that the loans are individually assessed to determine that the loan's carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral. Loans are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collectability of the full principal balance is in doubt. 
  Although we believe we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if the current economic environment deteriorates. Management uses relevant information available; however, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, as an integral part of their examination process, will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
  Deferred Income Taxes  . The Company records income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,    Income Taxes  ,  as amended, using the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities: (i) are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns; (ii) are attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases; and (iii) are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences and carryforwards became deductible.  Where applicable, deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance for any portions determined not likely to be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period of enactment. The valuation allowance is adjusted, by a charge or credit to income tax expense, as changes in facts and circumstances warrant. 
  Asset Impairment Judgments.   Certain of our assets are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at cost, fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances or write-downs are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of such assets. In addition to the impairment analyses related to our loans discussed above, another significant impairment analysis is the determination of whether there has been an other-than-temporary decline in the value of one or more of our securities. 
  Our available-for-sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders' equity. While the Company does not intend to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery of the remaining carrying value, we have the ability to sell the securities. Our held-to-maturity portfolio, consisting primarily of mortgage- backed securities and other debt securities for which we have a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, is carried at carrying value. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its cost or amortized cost, and whether such decline is other-than-temporary. Management utilizes various inputs to determine the fair value of the portfolio.  The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
  If a determination is made that a debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company will estimate the amount of the unrealized loss that is attributable to credit and all other non-credit related factors. The credit related component will be recognized as an other-than-temporary impairment charge in non-interest income as a component of gain (loss) on securities, net. The non-credit related component will be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. 
  Goodwill Impairment.   Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested, at least annually, for impairment at the reporting unit level. Goodwill was last evaluated on November 1, 2015.  Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For purposes of our goodwill impairment testing, we have identified a single reporting unit. 
  In connection with our annual impairment assessment we applied the guidance in FASB ASU 2011-08,   Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment,   which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

impairment test.  At   September 30, 2016  , our qualitative assessment concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and, therefore, the two-step goodwill impairment test was not required. 
  Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights ("MSR").   The initial asset recognized for originated MSR is measured at fair value. The fair value of MSR is estimated by reference to current market values of similar loans sold with servicing released. MSR are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. We apply the amortization method for measurements of our MSR. MSR are assessed for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. MSR impairment, if any, is recognized in a valuation allowance through charges to earnings as a component of fees and service charges. Subsequent increases in the fair value of impaired MSR are recognized only up to the amount of the previously recognized valuation allowance. 
  The estimated fair value of the MSR is obtained through independent third party valuations through an analysis of future cash flows, incorporating estimates of assumptions market participants would use in determining fair value including market discount rates, prepayment speeds, servicing income, servicing costs, default rates and other market driven data, including the market's perception of future interest rate movements. The valuation allowance is then adjusted in subsequent periods to reflect changes in the measurement of impairment. All assumptions are reviewed for reasonableness on a quarterly basis to ensure they reflect current and anticipated market conditions. 
  The fair value of MSR is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions. Changes in prepayment speed assumptions generally have the most significant impact on the fair value of our MSR. Generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of MSR. As interest rates rise, mortgage loan prepayments slow down, which results in an increase in the fair value of MSR. Thus, any measurement of the fair value of our MSR is limited by the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different point in time. 
  Stock-Based Compensation.   We recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards in accordance with ASC 718,    Compensation-Stock Compensation   .  We estimate the per share fair value of option grants on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using assumptions for the expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected option term.  These assumptions are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. The Black- Scholes option pricing model also contains certain inherent limitations when applied to options that are not traded on public markets.  The per share fair value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions. In general, the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected option term, and in the opposite direction as changes in the expected dividend yield. For example, the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock price volatility increases, risk-free interest rate increases, expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases. The use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options. 
    
  Executive Summary 
  Since the Company's initial public offering in 2005, we have transitioned from a wholesale thrift business to a retail commercial bank. This transition has been primarily accomplished by increasing the amount of our commercial loans and core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts.) Our transformation can be attributed to a number of factors, including organic growth, de novo branches, bank and branch acquisitions, as well as expanding our product offerings. We believe the attractive markets we operate in, namely, New Jersey and the greater New York metropolitan area, will continue to provide us with growth opportunities. Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business, both consumer and commercial. 
  Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is directly impacted by the market interest rate environment. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily interest-bearing transaction accounts, time deposits, and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, the shape of the market yield curve, the timing of the placement and the repricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, and the prepayment rate on our mortgage-related assets.  
  The persistent low interest rate environment over the past several years and a flattening of the yield curve have resulted in sustained pressure on our net interest margin.  Interest-earning assets continue to be originated or re-priced at yields lower than the overall portfolio, and competitive pricing remains strong in both the loan and deposit markets.  But despite the overall flattening of the treasury yield curve, we have been able to generally offset net interest margin compression through interest earning asset growth. We continue to actively manage our interest rate risk against a backdrop of slow but positive economic growth and the  
  
   47 

     Table of Contents  

potential for additional increases in short-term rates before the end of 2016.  If short-term interest rates increase, and the yield curve flattens further, we may be subject to near-term net interest margin compression.  Should the treasury yield curve steepen, we may experience an improvement in net interest income, particularly if short-term interest rates remain unchanged. 
  Our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic conditions. While the consumer continues to benefit from lower energy costs and improved housing and employment metrics, the velocity of economic growth, domestically and internationally, remains sluggish. The overall level of non-performing loans remains low compared to our national and regional peers. We attribute this to our conservative underwriting standards, our diligence in resolving our problem loans as well as the unseasoned nature of our loan portfolio. 
  We continue to grow and transform the composition of our balance sheet.  Total assets increased by   $1.65 billion  , or   7.9%  , to   $22.54 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $20.89 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  Net loans increased   $1.41 billion  , or   8.4%  ,  to   $18.07 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $16.66 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , and securities increased by   $157.4 million  , or   5.0%  , to   $3.31 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $3.15 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we originated   $1.74 billion   in multi-family loans,    $670.0 million   in commercial and industrial loans,   $442.0 million   in commercial real estate loans,   $395.0 million   in residential loans,   $335.7 million   in construction loans and   $235.7 million   in consumer and other loans. Our strategic objective is to become more commercial bank like and maintain a well-diversified loan portfolio. We understand the heightened regulatory sensitivity around commercial real estate and multi-family concentration and continue to be diligent in our underwriting and credit risk monitoring of these portfolios.  
  On May 3, 2016, we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with The Bank of Princeton.   As of June  30, 2016, The Bank of Princeton had assets of $1.0 billion, loans of $809 million and deposits of $812 million and operated 10 branches in New Jersey and 3 in the Philadelphia market. The transaction  is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. 
  Capital management is a key component of our business strategy.  We continue to manage our capital through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions, stock repurchases and cash dividends. Effective capital management and prudent growth allowed us to effectively leverage the capital from the Company s public offerings, while being mindful of tangible book value for stockholders.  Our capital to total assets ratio has decreased to   13.82%   at   September 30, 2016   from   15.85%   at   December 31, 2015  . In March 2015, we commenced the first stock repurchase plan since our second step for 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 17.9 million shares. This repurchase plan was completed in June 2015 when we announced our second share repurchase program which authorizes the repurchase of an additional 10% of outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 34.8 million shares.  On April 28, 2016, the Company announced its third share repurchase program, which authorized the purchase of an additional 10% of its publicly-held outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 31.5 million shares.  This plan commenced immediately upon the completion of the second repurchase plan in June 2016.  Stockholders' equity was impacted for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   by the repurchase of   29.2 million   shares of common stock for   $337.5 million   as well as cash dividends of   $0.18   per share totaling   $57.6 million  .  On October 27, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share, an increase of $0.02 from the prior quarter.  The dividend increase reinforces the Company's confidence in its business model and its plan to evolve into a more commercial focused bank.      
  We will continue to execute our business strategies with a focus on prudent and opportunistic growth while producing financial results that will create value for our stockholders. We intend to continue to grow our business and strengthen our market share through planned de novo branching, enhanced product offerings, investments in our people and opportunistic acquisitions in our market area.  During 2016, we continue  to enhance our employee training and development programs, build additional risk management and operational infrastructure and add key personnel as our company grows and our business changes.  We will continue to enhance stockholder value through our strategic capital initiatives, including growth both organically and through acquisitions, stock buybacks and dividend payments.

Net Loans.   Net loans increased by   $1.41 billion  , or   8.4%  , to   $18.07 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $16.66 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The detail of the loan portfolio (including PCI loans) is below: 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we originated   $1.74 billion   in multi-family loans,    $670.0 million   in commercial and industrial loans,   $442.0 million   in commercial real estate loans,   $395.0 million   in residential loans,   $335.7 million   in construction loans and   $235.7 million   in consumer and other loans. This increase in loans reflects our continued focus on generating multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, which was partially offset by pay downs and payoffs of loans.  Our loans are primarily on properties and businesses located in New Jersey and New York. 
       
  Our loan portfolio contains interest-only one-to four-family mortgage loans in which the borrower makes only interest payments for the first five, seven or ten years of the mortgage loan term. This feature will result in future increases in the borrower s contractually required payments due to the required amortization of the principal amount after the interest-only period. These payment increases could affect the borrower s ability to repay the loan. The amount of interest-only one-to four-family mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $136.8 million   and   $172.3 million  , respectively. From time to time and for competitive purposes, we originate commercial loans with limited interest only periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $631.3 million   commercial real estate interest only loans in our loan portfolio, of which   $498.7 million   have twenty-four months or less remaining on the interest only term.  We maintained stricter underwriting criteria for these interest-only loans than for amortizing loans. We believe these criteria adequately control the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.   
       
  In addition to the loans originated for our portfolio, our mortgage subsidiary, Investors Home Mortgage Co., originated $166.5 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   in residential mortgage loans that were sold to third party investors.

     Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth non-accrual loans and accruing past due loans (excluding PCI loans and loans held-for-sale) on the dates indicated as well as certain asset quality ratios: 

Total non-accrual loans   decreased   to   $97.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $100.3 million   at June 30, 2016 and   $124.1 million   at   September 30, 2015  . We continue to diligently resolve our troubled loans, however it takes a long period of time to resolve residential credits in our lending area.  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $30.0 million   of loans deemed as troubled debt restructurings, of which   $23.5 million   were residential and consumer loans,   $4.1 million   were commercial real estate loans, and   $2.4 million   were commercial and industrial loans. Troubled debt restructured loans in the amount of   $8.8 million   were classified as accruing and   $21.2 million   were classified as non-accrual at   September 30, 2016  .  
  In addition to non-accrual loans, we continue to monitor our portfolio for potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are defined as loans about which we have concerns as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the current loan repayment terms and which may cause the loan to be placed on non-accrual status.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has deemed potential problem loans excluding PCI loans, totaling   $47.7 million  , which comprised of   16   commercial real estate loans totaling   $40.7 million  ,   4   multi-family loans totaling   $5.2 million   and   11   commercial and industrial loans totaling   $1.8 million  .  Included in potential problem loans is a single relationship totaling $21.0 million.  The properties are single tenant and well-collateralized with strong loan to value ratios.  Management is actively monitoring all these loans.   
  The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans was   0.53%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.68%   at   December 31, 2015  . The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-accrual loans was   229.31%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   189.30%   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was   1.22%   compared to   1.29%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , loans meeting the Company s definition of an impaired loan were primarily collateral dependent loans totaling   $33.0 million  , of which   $12.7 million   of impaired loans had a specific allowance for credit losses of   $1.5 million   and   $20.3 million   of impaired loans had no specific allowance for credit losses. At   December 31, 2015  , loans meeting the Company s

definition of an impaired loan were primarily collateral dependent loans totaling   $57.0 million  , of which   $19.1 million   had a related allowance for credit losses of   $4.2 million   and   $37.8 million   had no related allowance for credit losses. 
  The allowance for loan losses increased by   $5.1 million   to   $223.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $218.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in our allowance for loan losses is due to the growth of the loan portfolio particularly the inherent credit risk associated with commercial real estate lending as well as commercial and industrial loans. Future increases in the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on the growth and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of loan delinquency and the economic conditions in our lending area. At   September 30, 2016  , our allowance for loan loss as a percent of total loans was   1.22%  . 
  The following table sets forth the allowance for loan losses at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   allocated by loan category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories. 

Securities.    Securities are held primarily for liquidity, interest rate risk management and long-term yield enhancement.  Our Investment Policy requires that investment transactions conform to Federal and New Jersey State investment regulations.  Our investments purchased may include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, securities issued by various Federal  Agencies, State and Municipal subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, investment grade corporate debt instruments, and mutual funds. In addition, Investors Bancorp may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations.  Purchase decisions are based upon a thorough analysis of each security to determine it conforms to our overall asset/liability management objectives. The analysis must consider its effect on our risk-based capital measurement, prospects for yield and/or appreciation and other risk factors.  Securities are classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale when purchased.  
           
  At   September 30, 2016  , our securities portfolio represented   14.7%   of our total assets.  Securities, in the aggregate,   increased   by   $157.4 million  , or   5.0%  , to   $3.31 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $3.15 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  This increase was a result of purchases partially offset by paydowns and sales. 
  Stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, Bank Owned Life Insurance and Other Assets.   The amount of stock we own in the FHLB   increase  d by   $44.1 million  , or   24.7%  , to   $222.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $178.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The amount of stock we own in the FHLB is primarily related to the balance of borrowings, therefore the   increase   in borrowings has an impact on FHLB stock owned. Bank owned life insurance was   $161.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $159.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Other assets were   $3.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $4.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  
  Deposits.    At   September 30, 2016  , deposits totaled   $14.95 billion  , representing   77.0%   of our total liabilities.  Our deposit strategy is focused on attracting core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts), resulting in a deposit mix of lower cost core products.  We remain committed to our plan of attracting more core deposits because core deposits represent a more stable source of low cost funds and may be less sensitive to changes in market interest rates.

We have a suite of commercial deposit products, designed to appeal to small business owners and non-profit organizations.  The interest rates we pay, our maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are all reviewed on a periodic basis. Deposit 
  rates and terms are based primarily on our current operating strategies, market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. We also rely on personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers, involvement in the communities we serve and an active marketing program to attract and retain deposits. 
  Deposits   increase  d by   $888.1 million  , or   6.3%  , from   $14.06 billion   at   December 31, 2015   to   $14.95 billion   at   September 30, 2016  .  Checking accounts   increase  d   $1.24 billion   to   $5.88 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $4.64 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  Core deposits represented approximately   80%   of our total deposit portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   76%   of our total deposit portfolio at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposit accounts, by account type, at the dates indicated: 

Borrowed Funds.    We borrow directly from the FHLB and various financial institutions. Our FHLB borrowings, frequently referred to as advances, are over collateralized by our residential and non-residential mortgage portfolios as well as qualified investment securities.  Borrowed funds   increase  d by   $940.6 million  , or   28.8%  , to   $4.20 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $3.26 billion   at   December 31, 2015   to help fund the continued growth of the loan portfolio.   
     Stockholders  Equity.   Stockholders' equity   decrease  d by   $196.6 million   to   $3.12 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $3.31 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The   decrease   is primarily attributed to the repurchase of   29.2 million   shares of common stock for   $337.5 million   as well as cash dividends of   $0.18   per share totaling   $57.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  These decreases were offset by net income of   $131.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Analysis of Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income represents the difference between income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends on the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities. 
    
  Average Balances and Yields.   The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, however interest receivable on these loans have been fully reserved for and not included in interest income.  The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

primarily as a result of lower loan sales through our mortgage subsidiary as well as the Bank. In addition security transactions and gain on other real estate owned decreased $861,000 and $795,000, respectively, from the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
    Total non-interest income decreased   $2.7 million  , or   8.7%  , to   $28.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Gain on loans, net decreased $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily as a result of lower loan sales through our mortgage subsidiary as well as the Bank.  In addition, gain on sale of other real estate owned decreased $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months of September 30, 2015. These decreases were offset by an increase of $2.1 million in gain on securities transactions for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the sale of securities totaling $69.1 million, resulting in a gain of $3.1 million. 
    
  Non-Interest Expenses.   Compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , total non-interest expenses increased   $5.5 million  , or   6.4%   year over year.  Compensation and fringe benefits increased $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to additions to our staff to support continued growth and infrastructure and normal merit increases. In addition,  professional fees increased $1.8 million as we build additional risk management and operational infrastructure. Federal insurance premiums and office occupancy and equipment expense increased $1.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Total non-interest expense was   $269.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $26.9 million  , or   11.1%   as compared to the   nine   months of   2015  .  Compensation and fringe benefits increased $20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.3 million in equity incentive expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting from the restricted stock and stock option grants on June 23, 2015 to certain employees, officers and directors of the Company, pursuant to the Investors Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan; additions to our staff to support continued growth; and normal merit increases. Office occupancy and equipment expense increased $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to new branch openings.   Professional fees and other operating expenses increased $2.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as we continue to build additional risk management and operational infrastructure as our company grows and we enhance our employee training and development programs. 
    
  Income Taxes.   Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $28.3 million compared with $22.9 million for the third quarter 2015.  The effective tax rates were 39.4% and 31.9% for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, income tax expense was $84.2 million and $74.9 million, respectively, and the effective tax rates were 39.1% and 35.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate is affected by the level of income earned that is exempt from tax relative to the overall level of pre-tax income, the level of expenses not deductible for tax purposes relative to the overall level of pre-tax income, the level of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among such jurisdictions, and the impact of any large but infrequently occurring items.  
    
  In the third quarter 2015, the Company realized the benefit of a Net Operating Loss carryforward from a previous acquisition.  Additionally, in April 2015, New York City changed their tax law to conform with that of New York State.  As a result, the company revalued its deferred tax positions which lowered the effective tax rate for the 2015 nine month period; however, it has the impact of increasing the rate in future periods. 
    
    Provision for Loan Losses.   Our provision for loan losses was   $5.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , net charge-offs were   $1.8 million   compared to   $504,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   our provision for loan loss was   $15.0 million   compared with   $21.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net charge-offs were   $10.0 million   compared to   $2.8 million   for the   nine   months   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Our provision for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is primarily a result of continued organic growth in the loan portfolio, specifically the multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios; the inherent credit risk in our overall portfolio, particularly the credit risk associated with commercial real estate lending and commercial and industrial lending; and the improvement in the level of non-performing loans.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, FHLB and other borrowings and, to a lesser extent, investment maturities. While scheduled amortization of loans is a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises, including unsecured overnight lines of credit, brokered deposits and other borrowings from the FHLB and other correspondent banks. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had overnight borrowings outstanding of   $492.0 million   with FHLB as compared to   $175.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The Company utilizes overnight borrowings from time to time to fund short-term liquidity needs. The Company had total borrowings of   $4.20 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $940.0 million   from   $3.26 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In the normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into various commitments, primarily relating to the origination of loans. At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding commitments to originate loans totaled   $682.0 million  ; outstanding unused lines of credit totaled   $1.08 billion  ; standby letters of credit totaled   $20.5 million   and outstanding commitments to sell loans totaled   $36.0 million  .  The Company expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current commitments in the normal course of business. Time deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled   $1.96 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . Based upon historical experience management estimates that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the Company. 
    Regulatory Matters.    In July 2013, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Final Capital Rules also revised the quantity and quality of required minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements, consistent with the Reform Act and the Third Basel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel III capital standards. In doing so, the Final Capital Rules: 
             
    Established a new minimum Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (common equity tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets) of 4.5% and increased the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0%, while maintaining the minimum Total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% and the minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4.0%. 
                
    Revised the rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity. 
                
    Phased out trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock as Tier 1 capital. 
                
    Added a requirement to maintain a minimum Conservation Buffer, composed of Common equity tier 1 capital, of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, to be applied to the new Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the Total risk-based capital ratio, which means that banking organizations, on a fully phased in basis no later than January 1, 2019, must maintain a minimum Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5% and a minimum Total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5% or have restrictions imposed on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments.  
                
    Changed the definitions of capital categories for insured depository institutions for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 prompt corrective action provisions. Under these revised definitions, to be considered well-capitalized, an insured depository institution must have a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%, a Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. 
     The new minimum regulatory capital ratios and changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets became effective for the Bank and Company on January 1, 2015. The required minimum Conservation Buffer will be phased in incrementally, starting at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018 and 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The rules impose restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary cash bonus payments if the minimum Conservation Buffer is not met.  As of   September 30, 2016   the Company and the Bank met the currently applicable Conservation Buffer of 0.625%.

  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
    In the normal course of operations, the Company engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in the financial statements. These transactions primarily relate to debt obligations and lending commitments. 
  The following table shows the contractual obligations of the Company by expected payment period as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Debt obligations include borrowings from the FHLB and other borrowings. The borrowings have defined terms and, under certain circumstances,   $28.8 million   of the borrowings are callable at the option of the lender.  Additionally, at   September 30, 2016  , the Company s commitments to fund unused lines of credit totaled   $1.08 billion  . Commitments to originate loans and commitments to fund unused lines of credit are agreements to lend additional funds to customers as long as there have been no violations of any of the conditions established in the agreements. Commitments generally have a fixed expiration or other termination clauses which may or may not require a payment of a fee. Since some of these loan commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  
  In addition to the contractual obligations previously discussed, we have other liabilities which include capitalized and operating lease obligations. These contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   have not changed significantly from   December 31, 2015  . 
  In the normal course of business the Company sells residential mortgage loans to third parties. These loan sales are subject to customary representations and warranties. In the event that we are found to be in breach of these representations and warranties, we may be obligated to repurchase certain of these loans. 
  The Company has entered into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company s  borrowings.  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , such derivatives were used to hedge the variability in cash flows

associated with certain short term wholesale funding transactions.  The fair value of the derivative as of September 30, 2016 was a liability of $1.1 million.   
  For further information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations, see Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in our   December 31, 2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
   
                 ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Qualitative Analysis.   We believe one significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk results from timing differences in the maturity or re-pricing of our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts (i.e., loan commitments); the effect of loan prepayments, deposits and withdrawals; the difference in the behavior of lending and funding rates arising from the uses of different indices; and  yield curve risk  arising from changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities for constant or variable credit risk investments. Besides directly affecting our net interest income, changes in market interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans, the volume of loan prepayments and refinancings, the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale and the mix and flow of deposits. 
  The general objective of our interest rate risk management is to determine the appropriate level of risk given our business model and then manage that risk in a manner consistent with our policy to reduce, to the extent possible, the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset Liability Committee, which consists of senior management and executives, evaluates the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities, our operating environment and capital and liquidity requirements and modifies our lending, investing and deposit gathering strategies accordingly. On a quarterly basis, our Board of Directors reviews the Asset Liability Committee report, the aforementioned activities and strategies, the estimated effect of those strategies on our net interest margin and the estimated effect that changes in market interest rates may have on the economic value of our loan and securities portfolios, as well as the intrinsic value of our deposits and borrowings. 
  We actively evaluate interest rate risk in connection with our lending, investing and deposit activities. Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one- to four-family fixed- and variable-rate first mortgages. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately 36% of our residential portfolio was in variable rate products, while 64% was in fixed rate products. Our variable-rate mortgage related assets have helped to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and is expected to benefit our long-term profitability, as the rates earned on these mortgage loans will increase as prevailing market rates increase. However, the current low interest rate environment, and the preferences of our customers, has resulted in more of a demand for fixed-rate products. This may adversely impact our net interest income, particularly in a rising rate environment. The origination of commercial real estate loans, particularly multi-family loans and commercial and industrial loans, which have outpaced the growth in the residential portfolio, help reduce our interest rate risk due to their shorter term compared to residential mortgage loans. In addition, we primarily invest in shorter-to-medium duration securities, which generally have shorter average lives and lower yields compared to longer term securities. Shortening the average lives of our securities, along with originating more adjustable-rate mortgages and commercial real estate mortgages, will help to manage interest rate risk. 
  We retain an independent, nationally recognized consulting firm that specializes in asset and liability management to complete our quarterly interest rate risk reports. We also retain a second nationally recognized consulting firm to prepare independently comparable interest rate risk reports for the purpose of validation. Both firms use a combination of analyses to monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates. The economic value of equity analysis is a model that estimates the change in net portfolio value ( NPV ) over a range of immediately changed interest rate scenarios. NPV is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. In calculating changes in NPV, assumptions estimating loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates that seem most likely based on historical experience during prior interest rate changes are used. 
  The net interest income analysis uses data derived from an asset and liability analysis, described below, and applies several additional elements, including actual interest rate indices and margins, contractual limitations and the U.S. Treasury yield curve as of the balance sheet date. In addition we apply consistent parallel yield curve shifts (in both directions) to determine possible changes in net interest income if the theoretical yield curve shifts occurred gradually over a one year period. Net interest income analysis also adjusts the asset and liability repricing analysis based on changes in prepayment rates resulting from the parallel yield curve shifts. 
  Our asset and liability analysis determines the relative balance between the repricing of assets and liabilities over multiple periods of time (ranging from overnight to five years). This asset and liability analysis includes expected cash flows from loans and mortgage-backed securities, applying prepayment rates based on the differential between the current interest rate and the market interest rate for each loan and security type. This analysis identifies mismatches in the timing of asset and liability cash

flows but does not necessarily provide an accurate indicator of interest rate risk because the assumptions used in the analysis may not reflect the actual response to market changes. 
  Quantitative Analysis.   The table below sets forth, as of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated changes in our NPV and our net interest income that would result from the designated changes in interest rates. Such changes to interest rates are calculated as an immediate and permanent change for the purposes of computing NPV and a gradual change over a one year period for the purposes of computing net interest income. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. The following table reflects management's expectations of the changes in NPV or net interest income for an interest rate decrease of 100 basis points or increase of 200 basis points. 

(1) 
    Assumes an instantaneous and parallel shift in interest rates at all maturities. 
              (2) 
    NPV is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. 
              (3) 
    Assumes a gradual change in interest rates over a one year period at all maturities. 
     The table set forth above indicates at   September 30, 2016  , in the event of a 200 basis points increase in interest rates, we would be expected to experience a   13.5%     decrease   in NPV and a   $34.5 million  , or   5.4%  ,   decrease   in net interest income. In the event of a 100 basis points decrease in interest rates, we would be expected to experience a   6.5%     decrease   in NPV and a   $5.1 million  , or   0.80%  ,   increase   in net interest income. This data does not reflect any future actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates, such as changing the mix in or growth of our assets and liabilities, which could change the results of the NPV and net interest income calculations. 
  As mentioned above, we retain two nationally recognized firms to compute our quarterly interest rate risk reports. Certain shortcomings are inherent in any methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in NPV and net interest income require certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The NPV and net interest income table presented above assumes the composition of our interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and, accordingly, the data does not reflect any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates. The table also assumes a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or the repricing characteristics of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV and net interest income table provide an indication of our sensitivity to interest rate changes at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effects of changes in market interest rates on our NPV and net interest income. 
   
                 ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS 

The following additional risk factors supplements the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A., Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
    
  Investors Bank Entered Into an Informal Agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, Which May Adversely Affect Its Ability to Receive Regulatory Approval for The Bank of Princeton Acquisition  
    
  On August 12, 2016, Investors Bank agreed to enter into an informal agreement ( Informal Agreement ) with the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance ( NJDOBI ) with regard to Bank Secrecy Act ( BSA ) and Anti-Money Laundering ( AML ) compliance matters. Investors Bank agreed to 1) develop, adopt and implement a system of internal controls designed to ensure full compliance with BSA, 2) conduct a comprehensive validation of Investors Bank s BSA/AML automated compliance system, and 3) develop, adopt and implement effective training programs relating to BSA. Investors Bank also agreed to review certain transactions and accounts for BSA and AML compliance and to establish a Compliance Committee of the Board.  
    
  Numerous actions have been taken or commenced by Investors Bank to strengthen its BSA and AML compliance practices, policies, procedures and controls. Investors Bank has enhanced its risk management and compliance programs through restructured reporting lines, improved technology and increased staff, including hiring senior personnel. The application filed by Investors Bank to acquire The Bank of Princeton remains under processing by the FDIC. Investors Bank believes that it will be able to demonstrate substantial compliance with the terms of the Informal Agreement and that, notwithstanding the Informal Agreement, regulatory approvals of The Bank of Princeton acquisition will be obtained, although no assurances can be provided that such approvals will be received or as to the timing of such approvals.  The failure to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Informal Agreement could also lead to further action by the FDIC and NJDOBI, which could adversely affect Investors Bank. 

If The Bank Regulators Impose Limitations On Our Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities, Our Earnings Could Be Adversely Affected 
    
  In 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the  Agencies ) issued joint guidance entitled  Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices  (the  CRE Guidance ). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months.  Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 380% of Bank total risk-based capital at September 30, 2016.   
    
  In December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the  2015 Statement ).  In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue  to pay special attention  to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward.  If the FDIC were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans we hold, our earnings would be adversely affected.
