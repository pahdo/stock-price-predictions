NOTE 1. 

COMPANY OVERVIEW AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

Company Overview  

ULURU Inc. (hereinafter  we ,  our ,  us ,  ULURU , or the  Company ) is a Nevada corporation.  We are a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing a broad range of innovative wound care and muco-adhesive film products based on our patented Nanoflex  and OraDisc TM  technologies, with the goal of improving outcomes for patients, health care professionals, and health care payers. 

Basis of Presentation  

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and include the accounts of ULURU Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Uluru Delaware Inc., a Delaware corporation.  They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of its operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been made. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.  These differences are usually minor and are included in our consolidated financial statements as soon as they are known.  Our estimates, judgments, and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ, and may differ materially, from those estimates. 

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016, including the risk factors set forth therein. 

Liquidity and Going Concern  

The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, contained an explanatory paragraph to reflect its significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our history of losses and our liquidity position, as discussed herein and in this Form 10-Q.  Based on our liquidity as of September 30, 2016, the expected level of operating expenses, and the projected sales of our existing products combined with other revenues, we believe that it may be possible for us to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the fourth quarter of 2016.  However, we cannot be sure that our revenues will grow or that we will generate significant positive cash flow from operations.  Moreover, we may not be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, to continue operations beyond the fourth quarter of 2016.  Therefore, we are unable to assert that our financial position is sufficient to fund operations beyond the fourth quarter of 2016, and, as a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond the fourth quarter of 2016.  In order to continue to advance our business plan and outstanding obligations after the fourth quarter of 2016, we will need to raise additional capital.  The Company is currently in the process of exploring capital raising opportunities but there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or on beneficial terms.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The significant accounting policies used in preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are consistent with those discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.

THE EFFECT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

There were no new accounting pronouncements adopted or enacted during the periods presented that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial statements. 

NOTE 4. 

SEGMENT INFORMATION 

We operate in one business segment: the research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products.  Our corporate headquarters in the United States collects product sales, licensing fees, and royalties from our arrangements with external customers and licensees.  Our entire business is managed by a single management team, which reports to the Chief Executive Officer. 

Our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of Altrazeal  which has occurred in twenty international markets and from our sales activities in the United States.  With respect to revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues reported for international sales represent the recognition of previously unamortized licensing fees only and do not include any Altrazeal  product sales. 

Revenues per geographic area for the three and nine months ended September 30 are summarized as follows: 

A significant portion of our revenues are derived from a few major customers.  Customers with greater than 10% of total sales, along with their relative percentage of all sales, for the three and nine months ended September 30 are represented on the following table: 

NOTE 5. 

INVENTORY 

As of September 30, 2016, our inventory was comprised of Altrazeal  finished goods, manufacturing costs incurred in the production of Altrazeal , and raw materials.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market.  We regularly review inventories on hand and write down the carrying value of our inventories for excess and potentially obsolete inventories based on historical usage and estimated future usage.  In assessing the ultimate realization of our inventories, we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements.  As actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by us, adjustment to inventories may be required. 

The components of inventory, at the different stages of production, consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Licensing rights  

On December 24, 2015, we entered into and closed the transaction contemplated by a License Purchase and Termination Agreement (the  Altrazeal Termination Agreement ) with Altrazeal Trading GmbH ( Altrazeal Trading ) and IPMD GmbH ( IPMD ).  The Altrazeal Termination Agreement relates to the License and Supply Agreement dated January 11, 2012 (the  Altrazeal License ), under which Altrazeal Trading and its affiliates were authorized by the Company to distribute our Altrazeal  wound care product in the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Middle East (excluding Jordan and Syria), North Africa, Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia.  Under the Altrazeal Termination Agreement, the Altrazeal License was assigned to the Company, thereby effecting its termination, and the Company s 25% ownership interest in Altrazeal Trading was cancelled.   In addition, the Company agreed to assume from Altrazeal Trading and certain affiliated entities rights and future obligations under sub-distribution agreements in numerous territories within the scope of the Altrazeal License and related consulting agreements. 

Under the terms of the Altrazeal Termination Agreement, we agreed to pay to Altrazeal Trading a net transfer fee of  1,570,271 and to pay IPMD a transfer fee of  703,500.  The net transfer fee to Altrazeal Trading includes adjustments for amounts owed by Altrazeal Trading to the Company.  The Company paid the net transfer fee (a) to Altrazeal Trading by means of the issuance of 4,441,606 shares of Common Stock together with warrants to purchase 444,161 shares of Common Stock and (b) to IPMD by means of the issuance of 2,095,241 shares of Common Stock, together with warrants to purchase 209,525 shares of Common Stock.  The warrants have an exercise price of $0.68 per share and a term of one-year. 

Altrazeal Trading also agreed to return inventory of Altrazeal  blisters held in its possession in an amount up to  88,834 ( Inventory Payment ).  To the extent Altrazeal Trading does not return the entire inventory, we may deduct from the Inventory Payment  4.20 per Altrazeal  blister not returned in usable condition.  We are currently in the process of confirming with Altrazeal Trading the actual number of Altrazeal  blisters to be returned. 

Under the Altrazeal Termination Agreement, we also agreed to file within twenty (20) days of closing a registration statement registering the resale of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock issued under the Altrazeal Termination Agreement and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration Statement to become effective.  In accordance with our obligations under the Altrazeal Termination Agreement, we filed with the SEC a registration statement that was declared effective on February 16, 2016.  We are required to keep the registration statement effective at all times with respect to such 2,500,000 shares, other than permitted suspension periods, until the earliest of (i) June 24, 2016, (ii) the date when Altrazeal Trading and IPMD may sell all of the registered shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act without volume limitations, or (iii) the date when Altrazeal Trading and IPMD no longer own any of the registered shares. As of the date of this filing, shares cannot be sold under the registration statement because the associated prospectus is not current. 

In connection with the Altrazeal Termination Agreement, we also entered into a Mutual Termination and Release Agreement, dated December 24, 2015, for the purpose of terminating the Binding Term Sheet dated May 12, 2015 with Altrazeal Trading and Firnron LTD (the  Term Sheet ).  Under the Term Sheet, it was contemplated that the Company would acquire all of the remaining equity interests in Altrazeal Trading. 

Licensing rights, net consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Amortization expense for intangible licensing rights assets was $81,955 and nil for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was $243,193 and nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

The future aggregate amortization expense for intangible licensing rights assets, remaining as of September 30, 2016, is as follows:

NOTE 8. 

INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES 

We use the equity method of accounting for investments in other companies that are not controlled by us and in which our interest is generally between 20% and 50% of the voting shares or over which we have significant influence, or both. 

Altrazeal Trading GmbH 

On January 11, 2012, we executed a shareholders  agreement for the establishment of Altrazeal Trading Ltd., a single purpose entity to be used for the exclusive marketing of Altrazeal  throughout the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, North Africa, and the Middle East.  As a result of this transaction, we received a non-dilutable 25% ownership interest in Altrazeal Trading Ltd.  On February 1, 2014, Altrazeal Trading Ltd. transferred all of their rights and obligations under the existing shareholders  agreement to Altrazeal Trading GmbH ( Altrazeal Trading ).  As a result of this transfer, we were entitled to receive a non-dilutable 25% ownership interest in Altrazeal Trading. 

On December 24, 2015, we completed the Altrazeal Termination Agreement with Altrazeal Trading and IPMD as more fully described in Note 7.  Under the Altrazeal Termination Agreement, our ownership interest in Altrazeal Trading was cancelled. 

Altrazeal AG 

On February 1, 2014, we executed a shareholders  agreement with Altrazeal AG, a single purpose entity for the marketing of Altrazeal  in several territories, including Africa (markets not already licensed), Latin America, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Jordan, Syria, Asia and the Pacific (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand).  As a result of this transaction, we were entitled to receive a non-dilutable 25% ownership interest in Altrazeal AG. 

In late March 2016, we provided Altrazeal AG with a notice identifying certain breaches in the Exclusive License and Supply Agreement, dated September 30, 2013 with Altrazeal AG (as amended, the  ELSA ).  On or about March 24, 2016, we learned that Altrazeal AG had commenced an insolvency proceeding in Switzerland and immediately sent an additional notice of termination referencing the insolvency.  On or about April 18, 2016, we learned that the insolvency petition filed by Altrazeal AG in Switzerland has been accepted by the court and an administrator is to be appointed.  As a result of the breaches by Altrazeal AG in the ELSA, the ELSA has been terminated in accordance with its terms.  As a result of the accepted insolvency petition, we believe that our ownership interest in Altrazeal AG is deemed to be worthless and certain net accounts receivables with Altrazeal AG are uncollectible. 

ORADISC GmbH 

On October 19, 2012, we executed a shareholders  agreement for the establishment of ORADISC GmbH, through which OraDisc  erodible film technology products would be developed and marketed.  We were entitled to receive a non-dilutable 25% ownership interest in ORADISC GmbH. 

In October 2012, we executed a License and Supply Agreement with ORADISC GmbH for the marketing of applications of our OraDisc  erodible film technology for dental applications including benzocaine (OraDisc  B), re-mineralization dental strips, fluoride dental strips, long-acting breath freshener, Amlexanox (OraDisc  A).  We also granted to ORADISC GmbH a twenty-four month option to utilize the OraDisc  erodible film technology for drug delivery for migraine, nausea and vomiting, cough and cold, and pain.  In January 2015, the initial twenty-four month option period to utilize the OraDisc  erodible film technology by ORADISC GmbH was extended until December 31, 2015.  In addition, this option expanded the applications for use to include anti-psychotics, neurologic products, and actives for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  On December 30, 2015, we received notice from ORADISC GmbH of their exercise of the option.  We informed ORADISC GmbH that under the terms of the option, the right to use the OraDisc  erodible film technology expired on December 31, 2015.  In March 2016, we also provided ORADISC GmbH with a notice identifying certain breaches in the License and Supply Agreement with ORADISC GmbH.  As a result of the breaches by ORADISC GmbH in the License and Supply Agreement, the License and Supply Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms and ORADISC GmbH has ceased to be a product distributor for the Company.  Since delivering the termination notice to ORADISC GmbH we have not had any communication from ORADISC GmbH with respect to the License and Supply Agreement. 

In March 2016, we learned that insolvency proceedings have been initiated with an Austrian commercial court with respect to IPMD GmbH and that one of its affiliated operating entities, ORADISC GmbH, might be affected by such insolvency proceeding filing.  Subsequently, we were informed that the insolvency application was opposed with various parties taking opposing views and that these legal proceedings continue to evolve.  We continue to evaluate our position with respect to IPMD GmbH and ORADISC GmbH. 

Financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 have not been released to us and, therefore, we have not included the effect of the financial activities of ORADISC GmbH in our financial statements for such reporting periods.  We believe that our share of the cumulative losses of ORADISC GmbH for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 would exceed the carrying value of our investment, therefore the equity method of accounting would be suspended for such reporting periods and no additional losses would be charged to operations.

Based upon the unaudited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, as provided to us by ORADISC GmbH, our unrecorded share of ORADISC GmbH cumulative losses as of December 31, 2014 totaled $22,826. 

Summarized financial information for our investment in ORADISC GmbH assuming 100% ownership is as follows: 

NOTE  9. 

ACCRUED LIABILITIES 

Accrued liabilities consisted of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

NOTE 10. 

PROMISSORY NOTE PAYABLE 

Debt Financing   April 2015  

On April 15, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated April 14, 2015 (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Inter-Mountain Capital Corp. ( Inter-Mountain ) related to our issuance of a $550,000 Promissory Note (the  April 2015 Note ).  The purchase price for the April 2015 Note, which reflects a $50,000 original issue discount, was $500,000. The Purchase Agreement also included representations and warranties, restrictive covenants and indemnification provisions standard for similar transactions. 

The April 2015 Note bears interest at the rate of 10.0% per annum, with monthly installment payments of $45,000 commencing on the date that is 120 calendar days after the issuance date of the April 2015 Note. At our option, subject to certain volume, price and other conditions, the monthly installments may be paid in whole, or in part, in cash or in Common Stock.  If the monthly installments are paid in Common Stock, such shares being issued will be based on a price that is 80% of the average of the three lowest volume weighted average prices of the shares of Common Stock during the preceding twenty trading days.  The percentage declines to 70% if the average of the three lowest volume weighted average prices of the shares of Common Stock during the preceding twenty trading days is less than $0.05 per share.  At our option, the outstanding principal balance of the April 2015 Note, or a portion thereof, may be prepaid in cash at 120% of the amount elected to be prepaid.  The April 2015 Note is unsecured and is not subject to conversion at the discretion of Inter-Mountain. 

Events of default under the April 2015 Note include failure to make required payments, the entry of a $100,000 judgment not stayed within 30 days, breach of representations or covenants under the transaction documents, various events associated with insolvency or failure to pay debts, delisting of the Common Stock, a restatement of financial statements and a default under certain other agreements.  In the event of default, the interest rate under the April 2015 Note increases to 18% and the April 2015 Note becomes callable at a premium.  In addition, Inter-Mountain has all remedies under law and equity. 

As part of the debt financing, Inter-Mountain also received a warrant (the  Warrant ) to purchase up to an aggregate of 194,118 shares of Common Stock.  The Warrant has an exercise price of $0.85 per share and expires on April 30, 2020. The Warrant includes a standard net cashless exercise provision and provisions requiring proportionate adjustments in connection with a recapitalization transaction. 

As part of the debt financing, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement whereby we agreed to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) a registration statement no later than May 11, 2015 and to cause such registration statement to be declared effective no later than 120 after the closing date and to keep such registration statement effective for a period of no less than 180 days.  In accordance with our obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, we filed with the SEC a registration statement that was declared effective on June 4, 2015.  Such registration statement ceased to be effective in April 2016. 

On January 11, 2016, we executed a Waiver Agreement with Inter-Mountain.  The Waiver Agreement relates to the April 2015 Note and our failure to make the installment payment under the April 2015 Note due in November 2015 on a timely basis.  Subsequent installment payments with respect to 2015 and 2016 have all been made on a timely basis.  Under the terms of the Waiver Agreement, we agreed to remit the November 2015 installment payment of $45,000 in cash and to pay Inter-Mountain an accommodation fee of $25,000, with the accommodation fee being added to the outstanding loan balance.

Using specific guidelines in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we allocated the value of the proceeds received to the promissory note and to the warrant on a relative fair value basis.  We calculated the fair value of the warrant issued with the debt instrument using the Black-Scholes valuation method, using the same assumptions used for valuing employee stock options, except the contractual life of the warrant was used. Using the effective interest method, the allocated fair value of the warrant was recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized over the expected term of the promissory note to interest expense. 

Information relating to the April 2015 Note is as follows: 

(1) 

As part of the April 2015 Note, at our option, subject to certain volume, price and other conditions, the monthly installments of principle and interest due under the April 2015 Note may be paid in whole, or in part, in cash or in Common Stock.  If the monthly installments are paid in Common Stock, such shares being issued will be based on a price that is 80% of the average of the three lowest volume weighted average prices of the shares of Common Stock during the preceding twenty trading days.  The percentage declines to 70% if the average of the three lowest volume weighted average prices of the shares of Common Stock during the preceding twenty trading days is less than $0.05 per share.

On August 11, 2016, the Company issued the final installment payment due under the April 2015 Note. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we have remitted six installment payments in cash totaling $343,526 and have remitted one installment payment by issuing 694,056 shares of Common Stock for principal and interest due under the April 2015 Note.

Common Stock Transaction  

March 2016 Offering  

On March 29, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with fifteen investors for the offer and sale of 25,245,442 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase an additional 25,245,442 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of $0.0713 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share and one warrant to purchase Common Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,800,000 (the  March 2016 Offering).

The March 2016 Offering resulted in gross proceeds of $1,800,000, of which $1,439,000 was received in March 2016 and $361,000 was received in April 2016.  As part of the offering expenses, we paid to a European placement agent a referral fee of $29,000 which is equal to 10% of the gross proceeds, provided that the investors referred by such placement agent were not U.S. Persons and were solicited outside the United States. 

Purchasers in the March 2016 Offering include Michael I. Sacks ($1,000,000), the father of Bradley J. Sacks, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Centric Capital Ventures, LLC ($19,000), an investment entity controlled by Bradley J. Sacks, Terrance K.

EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share  

In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 260,  Earnings per Share , basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, increased to include potential dilutive common shares.  The effect of outstanding stock options, restricted vesting Common Stock, convertible debt, convertible preferred stock, and warrants, when dilutive, is reflected in diluted earnings (loss) per common share by application of the treasury stock method.  We have excluded all outstanding stock options, restricted vesting Common Stock, convertible debt, convertible preferred stock, and warrants from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share because all such securities are antidilutive for all periods presented. 

Shares used in calculating basic and diluted net loss per common share exclude these potential common shares as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

As part of the April 2015 Note, at our option, subject to certain volume, price and other conditions, the monthly installments of principle and interest due under the April 2015 Note may be paid in whole, or in part, in cash or in Common Stock.  If the monthly installments are paid in Common Stock, such shares being issued will be based on a price that is 80% of the average of the three lowest volume weighted average prices of the shares of Common Stock during the preceding twenty trading days.  The percentage declines to 70% if the average of the three lowest volume weighted average prices of the shares of Common Stock during the preceding twenty trading days is less than $0.05 per share.  On August 11, 2016, the Company issued the final installment payment due under the April 2015 Note.

SHARE BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company s share-based compensation plan, the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended ( Equity Incentive Plan ), is administered by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors ( Board ), which selects persons to receive awards and determines the number of shares subject to each award and the terms, conditions, performance measures and other provisions of the award. 

Our Board did not grant any incentive stock option awards to executives or employees or any nonstatutory stock option awards to directors or non-employees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

We account for share-based compensation under FASB ASC Topic 718,  Stock Compensation , which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, consultants, and directors based on estimated fair values of the award on the grant date.  We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based awards. 

Stock Options (Incentive and Nonstatutory)  

The following table summarizes share-based compensation related to stock options for the three and nine months ended September 30: 

At September 30, 2016, the balance of unearned share-based compensation to be expensed in future periods related to unvested stock option awards, as adjusted for expected forfeitures, is approximately $17,000.  The period over which the unearned share-based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately twelve months.

Summary of Plans  

2006 Equity Incentive Plan 

In March 2006, our Board adopted and our stockholders approved our Equity Incentive Plan, which initially provided for the issuance of up to 133,333 shares of our Common Stock pursuant to stock option and other equity awards.  At the annual meetings of the stockholders held on May 8, 2007, December 17, 2009, June 15, 2010, June 14, 2012, June 13, 2013, and on June 5, 2014, our stockholders approved amendments to the Equity Incentive Plan to increase the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to stock options and other equity awards by 266,667 shares, 200,000 shares, 200,000 shares, 400,000 shares, 600,000 shares, and 1,000,000 shares, respectively, to a total of 2,800,000 shares. 

In December 2006, we began issuing stock options to employees, consultants, and directors.  The stock options issued generally vest over a period of one to four years and have a maximum contractual term of ten years.  In January 2007, we began issuing restricted stock awards to our employees.  Restricted stock awards generally vest over a period of six months to five years after the date of grant.  Prior to vesting, restricted stock awards do not have dividend equivalent rights, do not have voting rights and the shares underlying the restricted stock awards are not considered issued and outstanding.  Shares of Common Stock are issued on the date the restricted stock awards vest. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had granted options to purchase 2,061,167 shares of Common Stock since the inception of the Equity Incentive Plan, of which 714,571 were outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $2.35 per share, and we had granted awards for 68,616 shares of restricted stock since the inception of the Equity Incentive Plan, of which none were outstanding.  As of September 30, 2016, there were 2,015,983 shares that remained available for future grants under our Equity Incentive Plan.

NOTE 15. 

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements , ( ASC Topic 820 ) certain assets and liabilities of the Company are required to be recorded at fair value.  Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  The guidance in ASC Topic 820 also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. 

Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on our market assumptions.  Unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.  In some cases, the inputs used to measure an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In those instances, the fair value measurement is required to be classified using the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Such determination requires significant management judgment. 

The three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies, is as follows: 

Level 1 

Valuations based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 

Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

Level 3 

Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. 

Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.  We review the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis.  Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. 

Our financial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  We believe that the carrying value of our promissory note payable balances approximates fair value based on a valuation methodology using the income approach and a discounted cash flow model. 

The following table summarizes the fair value of our financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Our financial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.  We believe that the carrying value of our other receivable and convertible note payable balances approximates fair value based on a valuation methodology using the income approach and a discounted cash flow model.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Operating Leases  

On January 31, 2006 we entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory space in Addison, Texas.  The lease commenced on April 1, 2006 and originally continued until April 1, 2013.  The lease required a minimum monthly lease obligation of $9,330, which was inclusive of monthly operating expenses, until April 1, 2011 and at such time increased to $9,776, which was inclusive of monthly operating expenses.

The new office equipment lease, that commenced on February 1, 2015 and continues until February 1, 2018, requires a minimum lease obligation of $551 per month. 

The future minimum lease payments under the 2015 office lease and the 2015 equipment lease are as follows as of September 30, 2016:

Indemnification  

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future, but have not yet been made. To date, we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations. 

In accordance with our restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, we have indemnification obligations to our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while they are serving at our request in their respective capacities. There have been no claims to date and we have a director and officer insurance policy that enables us to recover a portion of any amounts paid for future potential claims. We have also entered into contractual indemnification agreements with each of our officers and directors. 

Related Party Transactions and Concentration  

On January 17, 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Helmut Kerschbaumer and Klaus Kuehne to each serve as a director of the Company.

As a result of the breaches in March and April 2016 by Altrazeal AG in the ELSA, we believe that the ELSA has been cancelled and Altrazeal AG has ceased to be a product distributor for the Company. 

Each of Mr. Kerschbaumer and Mr. Kuehne were managing directors of ORADISC GmbH and in such capacities may be considered, either singularly or collectively, to had control of, and made investment and business decisions on behalf of the ORADISC GmbH.  In April 2016, Mr. Kerschbaumer and Mr. Kuehne each resigned as a managing director of ORADISC GmbH.

We also granted to ORADISC GmbH a twenty-four month option to utilize the OraDisc  erodible film technology for drug delivery for migraine, nausea and vomiting, cough and cold, and pain.  In January 2015, the initial twenty-four month option period to utilize the OraDisc  erodible film technology by ORADISC GmbH was extended until December 31, 2015.  In addition, this option expanded the applications for use to include anti-psychotics, neurologic products, and actives for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  On December 30, 2015, we received notice from ORADISC GmbH of their exercise of the option.  We informed ORADISC GmbH that under the terms of the option, the right to use the OraDisc  erodible film technology expired on December 31, 2015.  In March 2016, we also provided ORADISC GmbH with a notice identifying certain breaches in the License and Supply Agreement with ORADISC GmbH.  As a result of the breaches by ORADISC GmbH in the License and Supply Agreement, the License and Supply Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms and ORADISC GmbH has ceased to be a product distributor for the Company.  Since delivering the termination notice to ORADISC GmbH we have not had any communication from ORADISC GmbH with respect to the License and Supply Agreement.

In addition, the Company assumed from Altrazeal Trading and certain affiliated entities rights and future obligations under sub-distribution agreements in numerous territories within the scope of the Altrazeal License and related consulting agreements. 

Under the terms of the Altrazeal Termination Agreement, we agreed to pay to Altrazeal Trading a net transfer fee of  1,570,271 and to pay IPMD a transfer fee of  703,500.  The net transfer fee to Altrazeal Trading includes adjustments for amounts owed by Altrazeal Trading to the Company.

We are currently in the process of confirming with Altrazeal Trading the actual number of Altrazeal  blisters to be returned. 

Under the Altrazeal Termination Agreement, we also agreed to file within twenty (20) days of closing a registration statement registering the resale of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock issued under the Altrazeal Termination Agreement and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration Statement to become effective.  In accordance with our obligations under the Altrazeal Termination Agreement, we filed with the SEC a registration statement that was declared effective on February 16, 2016.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations or financial position. There are no material proceedings to which any director, officer or any of our affiliates, any owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of any class of our voting securities, or any associate of any such director, officer, our affiliates, or security holder, is a party adverse to us or our consolidated subsidiary or has a material interest adverse thereto; however, one or more events may lead to a formal dispute or proceeding in the future. 

In October 2016, we learned that insolvency proceedings have been initiated with an Austrian commercial court with respect to Altrazeal Trading, currently a shareholder of the Company and previously a distributor of Altrazeal  for the Company.  We are evaluating our position with respect to the insolvency filing by Altrazeal Trading GmbH. 

On May 17, 2016, we provided KunWha Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd with a notice identifying certain breaches in the License and Supply Agreement, dated June 2, 2008.  KunWha Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd failed to remedy the breaches within 30 (thirty) days of receiving our notice, and therefore, we believe that the License and Supply Agreement has been cancelled. 

On May 17, 2016, we provided Jiangxi Aiqilin Pharmaceuticals Group with a notice identifying certain breaches in the License and Supply Agreement, dated June 28, 2010.  Jiangxi Aiqilin Pharmaceuticals Group failed to remedy the breaches within 30 (thirty) days of receiving our notice, and therefore, we believe that the License and Supply Agreement has been cancelled. 

On May 17, 2016, we provided Novartis Animal Health Inc. with a notice identifying certain breaches in the Distribution Agreement, dated August 23, 2010.  In July 2016, we received confirmation from Novartis Animal Health Inc. that the Distribution Agreement has been cancelled. 

In late March 2016, we provided Altrazeal AG with a notice identifying certain breaches in the ELSA.  On or about March 24, 2016, we learned that Altrazeal AG had commenced an insolvency proceeding in Switzerland and immediately sent an additional notice of termination referencing the insolvency.  On or about April 18, 2016, we have learned that the insolvency petition filed by Altrazeal AG in Switzerland has been accepted by the court and an administrator is to be appointed.  As a result of the breaches by Altrazeal AG in the ELSA, we believe that the ELSA has been cancelled.  As a result of the accepted insolvency petition, we believe that our ownership interest in Altrazeal AG is deemed to be worthless and certain net accounts receivables with Altrazeal AG are uncollectible. 

In March 2016, we learned that insolvency proceedings have been initiated with an Austrian commercial court with respect to IPMD GmbH and that one of its affiliated operating entities, ORADISC GmbH, might be affected by such insolvency proceeding filing.  Subsequently, we were informed that the insolvency application was opposed with various parties taking opposing views and that these legal proceedings continue to evolve.  We continue to evaluate our position with respect to IPMD GmbH and ORADISC GmbH. 

In October 2012, we executed a License and Supply Agreement with ORADISC GmbH for the marketing of applications of our OraDisc  erodible film technology for dental applications including benzocaine (OraDisc  B), re-mineralization dental strips, fluoride dental strips, long-acting breath freshener, Amlexanox (OraDisc  A).  We also granted to ORADISC GmbH a twenty-four month option to utilize the OraDisc  erodible film technology for drug delivery for migraine, nausea and vomiting, cough and cold, and pain.  In January 2015, the initial twenty-four month option period to utilize the OraDisc  erodible film technology by ORADISC GmbH was extended until December 31, 2015.  In addition, this option expanded the applications for use to include anti-psychotics, neurologic products, and actives for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.  On December 30, 2015, we received notice from ORADISC GmbH of their exercise of the option.  We informed ORADISC GmbH that under the terms of the option, the right to use the OraDisc  erodible film technology expired on December 31, 2015.  In March 2016, we also provided ORADISC GmbH with a notice identifying certain breaches in the License and Supply Agreement with ORADISC GmbH.  As a result of the breaches by ORADISC GmbH in the License and Supply Agreement, the License and Supply Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms and ORADISC GmbH has ceased to be a product distributor for the Company.  Since delivering the termination notice to ORADISC GmbH we have not had any communication from ORADISC GmbH with respect to the License and Supply Agreement.

Business Overview  

ULURU Inc. (together with our subsidiaries,  we ,  our ,  us ,  ULURU , or the  Company ) is a Nevada corporation.  We are a specialty pharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing a range of innovative wound care and muco-adhesive film products based on our patented Nanoflex  and OraDisc TM  technologies, with the goal of improving outcomes for patients, health care professionals, and health care payers. 

Our strategy is twofold: 

Establish a market leadership position in wound management by developing and commercializing a customer focused portfolio of innovative wound care products based on our Nanoflex  technology to treat the various phases of wound healing; and 

Develop our oral muco-adhesive film technology (OraDisc TM ) for systemic drug delivery and for delivery of actives to the oral cavity. 

Utilizing our technologies, three of our products have been approved for marketing in various global markets.  In addition, additional products may be developed utilizing our patented Nanoflex  and OraDisc TM  technologies. 

Altrazeal  Transforming Powder Dressing, based on our Nanoflex  technology, has the potential to change the way health care providers approach their treatment of wounds.  Launched in September 2008, the product is indicated for both exuding acute wounds such as partial thickness burns, donor sites, non-healing surgical wounds, and trauma and for chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers; 

Aphthasol  is a drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of canker sores; and 

OraDisc  A was developed as an improved drug delivery system for the treatment of canker sores. 

Recently, we have developed a series of operational plans to enhance and streamline the business: 

We have embarked on a plan to consolidate operations of disparate affiliates to remove inefficiency and align interests; 

We completed the acquisition of the European, Middle East and Australian marketing and distribution rights for Altrazeal  from Altrazeal Trading GmbH and its affiliates; 

As a result of a breach by Altrazeal AG of its obligations under our licensing agreement, we currently do not have a direct distributor acting on our behalf in the territories previously covered by the AG Agreement, which included Africa (markets not already licensed), Latin America, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Jordan, Syria, Asia and the Pacific (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand).   We now have the opportunity to potentially form direct relationships with sub-distributors in the territories previously covered by the AG Agreement for the purpose of accepting orders directly from, and fulfilling orders directly to, such sub-distributors; 

We have determined that creating a product roadmap with line extensions is necessary to respond to market interest in Altrazeal  

As a result of a breach by ORADISC GmbH of its obligations under our licensing agreement, we have regained control of all of the OraDisc  rights and we have the opportunity to develop and commercialize products utilizing our OraDisc  film technology ourselves or together with other partners; 

We have implemented a plan to restructure our operations to improve efficiency and reduce cost, including production, distribution, and administration costs; 

We are undertaking efforts to stimulate sales and enhance marketing; and 

We have developed a new plan to streamline regulatory activity to expedite new market entry.

Recent Developments  

Product Distribution  

On December 24, 2015, the Company completed the License Purchase and Termination Agreement (the  LPTA ) with Altrazeal Trading GmbH and purchased the marketing and distribution rights for Altrazeal  in certain territories, to include Europe, Middle East and Australia.  In October 2016, the Company also learned that insolvency proceedings have been initiated with an Austrian commercial court with respect to Altrazeal Trading GmbH. 

Due to uncertainties and confusion experienced by the sub-distributors under the LPTA, the Company has not received product orders that are consistent with prior years from the sub-distributors in Europe and the Middle East.  Also negatively effecting product orders has been the cancellation of the licensing agreement with Altrazeal AG, our prior distributor for Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia, as there has not been any new product orders from these territories.  The Company is currently evaluating all of its distribution agreements and distribution partners for ways to stimulate product orders of Altrazeal  in the near term. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Fluctuations in Operating Results  

Our results of operations have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future. We anticipate that our quarterly and annual results of operations will be impacted for the foreseeable future by several factors, including the timing and amount of payments received pursuant to our current and future collaborations, and the progress and timing of expenditures related to our development and commercialization efforts. Due to these fluctuations, we believe that the period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance. 

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Total Revenues  

Revenues were approximately $6,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to revenues of approximately $25,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and were composed of, in approximate amounts, licensing fees of $2,000 from OraDisc  licensing agreements and product sales of $4,000 for Altrazeal . 

The net decrease of $19,000 in revenues is attributable to the decrease of approximately $4,000 in Altrazeal  product sales as territories in Europe and the Middle East have not generated product orders consistent with prior year.  Also effecting the decrease in product sales has been the cancellation of the licensing agreement with Altrazeal AG, our prior distributor for Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia, as there have not been any new product orders from these territories.  Another area of decrease has been in licensing fee revenues of $15,000 due to the cancellation of licensing agreements related to Altrazeal  and the recognition of all unamortized licenses fees occurring in the first and second quarters of 2016. 

Costs and Expenses  

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $500 and was composed entirely of costs associated with the sale of Altrazeal . 

Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $4,000 and was composed of, in approximate numbers, $3,000 from the sale of Altrazeal  and $1,000 from the write-off of obsolete raw materials.

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses totaled approximately $119,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, including a credit of $3,000 in share-based compensation, compared to approximately $172,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which included $19,000 in share-based compensation.  The decrease of approximately $53,000 in research and development expenses was primarily due to, in approximate numbers, a decrease of $19,000 direct research costs primarily related to consulting costs and product registration costs, and a decrease of $65,000 in scientific compensation related wage reductions by existing staff, lower head count, and lower share-based compensation.  These expense decreases were partially offset by an increase of $29,000 in regulatory consulting costs related to our annual audit for ISO compliance and an increase of $2,000 in miscellaneous operating costs. 

The direct research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were, in approximate numbers, as follows: 

Selling, General and Administrative 

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $305,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, including $17,000 in share-based compensation, compared to approximately $502,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which included $52,000 in share-based compensation.  The decrease of approximately $197,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to, in approximate numbers, a decrease of $86,000 in directors fees that is composed of a decrease of $33,000 in share-based compensation and a decrease of $53,000 in cash compensation, a decrease of $55,000 in compensation as costs associated with our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer are categorized under international sales management whereas the costs for our prior President and Chief Executive Officer were categorized under compensation, a decrease of $44,000 related to accruals for doubtful accounts receivables, a decrease of $28,000 in shareholder costs related to the timing of the annual meeting of stockholders being held in September 2015, and a decrease of $4,000 in miscellaneous expenses.  These expense decreases were partially offset by, in approximate numbers, an increase of $17,000 in operating costs associated with international sales management and an increase of $3,000 in brand marketing and convention costs. 

Amortization of Intangible Assets 

Amortization of intangible assets expense totaled approximately $202,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $120,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The expense for each period consists primarily of amortization associated with our acquired patents and acquired licensing rights.  The increase of approximately $82,000 is attributable to the acquisition of licensing rights that occurred in December 2015.  There were no additional acquisitions of patents or licensing rights during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Depreciation 

Depreciation expense totaled approximately $33,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $42,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease of approximately $9,000 is attributable to certain equipment being fully depreciated. 

Interest and Miscellaneous Income 

Interest and miscellaneous income totaled approximately $200 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately zero for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense totaled approximately $33,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $52,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Interest expense typically includes financing costs for our insurance policies, interest costs related to regulatory fees, and interest costs and amortization of debt discount and financing costs related to debt.  The decrease of approximately $19,000 in interest expense is primarily attributable to the decreased principal balance due under the promissory note issued in April 2015 (the  April 2015 Note ) to Inter-Mountain Capital Corp. ( Inter-Mountain ) and  accruals for interest expense associated with regulatory fees. 

Foreign Currency Transaction Gain (Loss) 

Foreign currency transaction loss totaled approximately $300 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a foreign currency transaction gain of approximately $1,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease of approximately $1,300 is related to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate experienced during 2015 and 2016 and the pricing of Altrazeal  to our international distributors being denominated in Euros.

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Total Revenues  

Revenues were approximately $379,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to revenues of approximately $578,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and were composed of, in approximate amounts, licensing fees of $363,000 from Altrazeal  and OraDisc  licensing agreements and product sales of $16,000 for Altrazeal . 

The net decrease of $200,000 in revenues is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $516,000 in Altrazeal  product sales as territories in Europe and the Middle East have not generated product orders consistent with prior year.  Also effecting the decrease in product sales has been the cancellation of the licensing agreement with Altrazeal AG, our prior distributor for Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia, as there have not been any new product orders from these territories. The decrease in Altrazeal  product sales was partially offset by the recognition of unamortized licensing fees of approximately $316,000 related to the cancellation of distribution agreements with three distributors; Altrazeal AG, KunWha Pharmaceutical Co., and Jiangxi Aiqilin Pharmaceuticals Group.  The recognition of unamortized licensing fees is based upon the cancellation of the distribution agreements and that there are no further performance obligations that are required by the Company under each distribution agreement.  The Company originally received a licensing payment from Altrazeal AG of $125,000 in September 2013, received a licensing payment from KunWha Pharmaceutical Co. of $50,000 in June 2008, and received licensing payments from Jiangxi Aiqilin Pharmaceuticals Group of $250,000 and $100,000 in June 2010 and September 2011, respectively.

The decrease of approximately $205,000 in research and development expenses was primarily due to, in approximate numbers, a decrease of $118,000 in direct research costs primarily related to consulting costs and product registration costs, and a decrease of $158,000 in scientific compensation related wage reductions by existing staff, lower head count, and lower share-based compensation.  These expense decreases were partially offset by an increase of $61,000 in regulatory consulting costs and an increase of $10,000 in miscellaneous operating costs. 

The direct research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were, in approximate numbers, as follows:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

We have funded our operations primarily through the public and private sales of convertible notes and Common Stock.  Product sales, royalty payments, licensing fees and milestone payments from our corporate alliances have also provided, and are expected in the future to provide, funding for operations. 

Based on our liquidity as of September 30, 2016, the expected level of operating expenses, and the projected sales of our existing products combined with other revenues, we believe that it may be possible for us to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the fourth quarter of 2016.  However, we cannot be sure that our revenues will grow or that we will generate significant positive cash flow from operations.  Moreover, we may not be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, to continue operations beyond the fourth quarter of 2016.  Therefore, we are unable to assert that our financial position is sufficient to fund operations beyond the fourth quarter of 2016, and, as a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond the fourth quarter of 2016.  In order to continue to advance our business plan and outstanding obligations after the fourth quarter of 2016, we will need to raise additional capital.  The Company is currently in the process of exploring capital raising opportunities but there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or on beneficial terms. 

Our principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents.  As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $186,000 which is an increase of approximately $6,000 as compared to our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 of approximately $180,000.  Our working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was approximately $(1,250,000) at September 30, 2016 as compared to our working capital at December 31, 2015 of approximately $(1,614,000). 

Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $1,359,000.  The principal components of net cash used for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were, in approximate numbers, our net loss of $1,869,000, a decrease of $278,000 in deferred revenues due to amortization of revenues, a decrease of $134,000 in accrued liabilities due to repayment of temporary compensation deferrals, and an increase of $50,000 in inventory.  Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included substantial non-cash charges of approximately $878,000 in the form of share-based compensation, amortization of patents and licensing rights, depreciation, amortization of debt discount, amortization of deferred financings costs, interest due on promissory notes settled with Common Stock, consulting services settled in Common Stock, and an accommodation fee due on the promissory note.  The aforementioned net cash used for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was partially offset by, in approximate numbers, a decrease of $44,000 in accounts receivable due to collection activities, a decrease of $30,000 in prepaid expenses related to insurance, listing fees, and consulting, and an increase of $20,000 in accounts payable due to timing of vendor payments. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $1,040,000.  The principal components of net cash used for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were, in approximate numbers, our net loss of $2,334,000, an increase of $453,000 in accounts receivable related to increased international product sales, an increase of $286,000 in inventory related to the manufacture of Altrazeal , and a decrease of $9,000 in deferred revenues.  Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included substantial non-cash charges of approximately $787,000 in the form of share-based compensation, depreciation, amortization of patents, amortization of debt discount, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest due on a promissory note settled with common stock.  The aforementioned net cash used for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was partially offset by, in approximate numbers, an increase of $992,000 in accounts payable due to timing of vendor payments, an increase of $227,000 in accrued liabilities due to compensation deferrals, and a decrease of $36,000 in prepaid expenses related to insurance, listing fees, and consulting.

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $1,367,000 and was composed of, in approximate numbers, the net proceeds of $1,732,000 from the March 2016 Offering, the repayment of $343,000 in principle due on the promissory note with Inter-Mountain, and offering costs of $22,000 incurred in 2016 that are associated with the acquisition of licensing rights by the Company in December 2015. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $493,000 and was composed of $482,000 from the debt transaction with Inter-Mountain in April 2015 and an adjustment of $11,000 of offering costs associated with our sale of preferred stock in 2011. 

Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $186,000.  We expect to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments on working capital, general corporate purposes, property and equipment, and the payment of contractual obligations.  Our long-term liquidity will depend to a great extent on our ability to fully commercialize our Altrazeal  and OraDisc  technologies; therefore we are continuing to look both domestically and internationally for opportunities that will enable us to expand our business.  At this time, we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of sales growth, if any, during the remainder of 2016 and beyond, such as the speed and degree of market acceptance, the impact of competition, our ability to establish effective relationships with sub-distributors under agreements Altrazeal Trading agreed to assign to us or that we could contract as a result of the termination of the ELSA with Altrazeal AG, the effectiveness of the sales and marketing efforts of any distributors and sub-distributors, and the outcome of our current efforts to develop, receive approval for, and successfully launch our near-term product candidates. 

As of September 30, 2016, our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was approximately $(1,250,000).  Based on our liquidity as of September 30, 2016, the expected level of operating expenses, and the projected sales of our existing products combined with other revenues, we believe that it may be possible to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the fourth quarter of 2016.  However, we cannot be sure that our revenues will grow or that we will generate significant positive cash flow from operations.  Moreover, we may not be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, to continue operations beyond the fourth quarter of 2016.  Therefore, we are unable to assert that our financial position is sufficient to fund operations beyond the fourth quarter of 2016, and, as a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond the fourth quarter of 2016.  In order to continue to advance our business plan and outstanding obligations after the fourth quarter of 2016, we will need to raise additional capital.   The Company is currently in the process of exploring capital raising opportunities but there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or on beneficial terms. 

In order to continue to advance our business plan and outstanding obligations, we will need to raise additional capital in the foreseeable future to fund our operations and to potentially expand our business.  We expect to seek additional funding through public and/or private offerings of debt and equity securities.  We may also seek capital from other sources, including contribution by others to joint ventures, or collaborative arrangements or licensing for the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of products under development.  As of this Report, we are not party to any commitments with respect to our potential receipt of additional capital. 

Historically, we have been able to raise capital as needed to fund our operations at a base level, but we have generally not raised capital sufficient to fund unexpected occurrences, to cover projected expenses over the long term or to fund extensive research, marketing and development.  As a result, there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain capital as needed later in 2016.  In addition, we will need to continue to seek capital from the market over the long term. To the extent we raise capital, it generally will be on terms that are dilutive to shareholders and may require the issuance of warrants or similar incentives, the agreement to restrictive covenants and/or the pledge of our assets as securities for debt financings. 

Our future capital requirements and adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including: 

our ability, or inability, to successfully commercialize our wound management products and the market acceptance of these products; 

our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with corporate partners for the development and commercialization of certain product opportunities; 

our ability to establish effective relationships with sub-distributors under agreements Altrazeal Trading agreed to assign to us or that we could contract as a result of the termination of the ELSA with Altrazeal AG; 

continued scientific progress in our development programs; 

our ability to collect outstanding receivables; 

the costs involved in filing, prosecuting and enforcing patent claims; 

competing technological developments; 

the trading volume and price of our capital stock; 

the actions of parties whose consents, waivers or prompt responses are required for approval of a financing (such as parties with rights of first refusal or consent rights); 

our general financial situation, including the amount of our indebtedness; and 

the cost of, and other issues associated with, manufacturing and production scale-up.

Contractual Obligations 

The following table summarizes our outstanding contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2016, which is composed of a lease agreement for office and laboratory space in Addison, Texas and a lease agreement for office equipment.  These obligations and commitments assume non-termination of agreements and represent expected payments based on current operating forecasts, which are subject to change: 

Capital Expenditures 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our expenditures for property, equipment, and leasehold improvements were $2,165 and $787, respectively.  At this time, we believe that our capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 will be approximately $2,000 and consist of office equipment. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements. 

Impact of Inflation 

We have experienced only moderate price increases over the last three fiscal years under our agreements with third-party manufacturers as a result of raw material and labor price increases.  However, there can be no assurance that possible future inflation would not impact our operations. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Concentration of credit risk with respect to financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk due to the use of a limited number of banking institutions and due to maintaining cash balances in banks, which, at times, may exceed the limits of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Currently, we utilized Bank of America, N.A. as our banking institution.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $186,000 and $180,000, respectively.  We also invest cash in excess of immediate requirements in money market accounts, certificates of deposit, corporate commercial paper with high quality ratings, and U.S. government securities.  These investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes.  We are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by these institutions. 

Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are customers with balances that exceed 5% of total consolidated trade accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, one customer, being one of our international distributors, exceeded the 5% threshold, with 95%.  At December 31, 2015, one customer, being one of our international distributors, exceeded the 5% threshold with 92%.  Historically, we have relied primarily on a group of affiliated entities for the distributions of our products.  At least one of these entities, Altrazeal AG, is insolvent, and we believe that related distributors may also be insolvent.  The weak financial position of these distributors has historically led to issues collecting accounts receivable. Going forward, we are routinely assessing the financial strength of our most significant customers and monitoring the amounts owed to us, taking appropriate action when necessary.  As a result, we believe that our prospective accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. 

Concentrations of Foreign Currency Risk 

Currently, a portion of our revenues and all of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. We expect an increase in revenues in international territories denominated in a foreign currency.  Certain of our licensing and distribution agreements in international territories are denominated in Euros.  Currently, we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to mitigate foreign currency risk.  As our international operations continue to grow, we may engage in hedging activities to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Our critical accounting policies are summarized in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016.  We had no significant changes in our critical accounting policies since our last annual report.
