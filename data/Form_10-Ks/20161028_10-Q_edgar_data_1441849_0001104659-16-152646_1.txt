   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
       
   1.  Organization and Business   
     
  We are one of the largest producers of coal in the United States of America ( U.S. ) and the Powder River Basin ( PRB ), based on our 2015 coal sales.  We operate some of the safest mines in the coal industry.  According to the most current Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) data, we have one of the lowest employee all injury incident rates among the largest U.S. coal producing companies.  
     
  We currently operate solely in the PRB, the lowest cost region of the major coal producing regions in the U.S., where we own and operate three surface coal mines: the Antelope Mine, the Cordero Rojo Mine, and the Spring Creek Mine.  
     
  Our Antelope Mine and Cordero Rojo Mine are located in Wyoming and our Spring Creek Mine is located in Montana.  Our mines produce subbituminous thermal coal with low sulfur content, and we sell our coal primarily to domestic electric utilities.  Thermal coal is primarily consumed by electric utilities and industrial consumers as fuel for electricity generation.  In 2015, the coal we produced generated approximately 3% of the electricity produced in the U.S.  We do not produce any metallurgical coal.  
     
  In addition, we have two development projects.  The Youngs Creek project, an undeveloped surface mine project in the Northern PRB region, is located in Wyoming, approximately 13 miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming, seven miles south of our Spring Creek Mine and seven miles from the mainline railroad, contiguous with the Wyoming-Montana state line.  We have not been able to classify the Youngs Creek project mineral rights as proven and probable reserves as they remain subject to further exploration and evaluation based on market conditions.  We also have an option to lease agreement and a corresponding exploration agreement with the Crow Tribe of Indians (the  Big Metal project ).  The Big Metal project is located on the Crow Indian Reservation in southeast Montana and is near the Youngs Creek project.  We are in the process of evaluating development options for the Youngs Creek project and the Big Metal project and believe that their proximity to the Spring Creek Mine represents an opportunity to optimize our mine developments in the Northern PRB.  For purposes of this report, the term  Northern PRB  refers to the area within the PRB that lies within Montana and the northern part of Sheridan County, Wyoming.  
     
  In 2015, we amended agreements with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership ( Westshore ) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway ( BNSF ) providing for reduced quarterly take-or-pay payments from 2016 through 2018.  We meet regularly with Westshore and BNSF to discuss market conditions, potential shipments, and the terms for such shipments, if any.  The recent increase in seaborne thermal coal pricing has enabled us to begin contracting export shipments for delivery between November 2016 and February 2017.  Shipments will directly offset the amended take-or-pay obligations on a ton-for-ton basis.  
     
    Principles of Consolidation    
     
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  In accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial statements, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include certain information and footnote disclosures that are required to be included in annual financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  The year-end unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 Form 10-K ).  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary to a fair statement of our financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results of our operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future quarters or for the year ended December 31, 2016.

   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
  The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  Significant estimates in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include: assumptions about the amount and timing of future cash flows and related discount rates used in determining asset retirement obligations ( AROs ) and in testing long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment; the fair value of derivative financial instruments; the calculation of mineral reserves; equity-based compensation expense; workers  compensation claims; reserves for contingencies and litigation; useful lives of long-lived assets; postretirement employee benefit obligations; the recognition and measurement of income tax benefits and related deferred tax asset valuation allowances; and allowances for inventory obsolescence and net realizable value.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  
     
  Certain immaterial amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.  Due to the tabular presentation of rounded amounts, certain tables reflect insignificant rounding differences.  
     
   2.  Accounting Policies and Standards Update   
     
    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standard setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements.  Updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ).  Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU 2016-15 ), which standardizes cash flow statement classification of certain transactions, including cash payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment, proceeds from insurance claim settlements, and distributions received from equity method investments. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are considering the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 may have on our presentation of cash flows.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Share Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ), which simplifies the accounting for stock-based compensation transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are considering the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-09 may have on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02 ), which would require the lessee to recognize the assets and liabilities on all leases that may have not been recognized in the past.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are considering the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 may have on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  
     
  From May 2014 through May 2016, the FASB issued several ASUs related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  These ASUs are intended to provide greater insight into both revenue that has been recognized and revenue that is expected to be recognized in the future from existing contracts.  The new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although entities may adopt one year earlier if they choose.  We are considering the impact the adoption of the new revenue recognition ASUs may have on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  
     
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ), which would require disclosure of uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  The new

   CLOUD PEAK ENERGY INC.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
  guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods thereafter.  Early application is permitted.  We plan to adopt ASU 2014-15 begining December 31, 2016.  

3.  Inventories, Net   
     
   Inventories, net    consisted of the following (in thousands):  

4.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
     
  We use a three-level fair value hierarchy that categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on the observability of the inputs utilized in the valuation.  The levels of the hierarchy, as defined below, give the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  
     
                        Level 1 is defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  Our Level 1 assets include money market funds. 
     
                        Level 2 is defined as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices.  These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Our Level 2 assets and liabilities include derivative financial instruments with fair values derived from quoted prices in over-the-counter markets or from prices received from direct broker quotes. 
     
                        Level 3 is defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.  We had no Level 3 financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 
     
  The tables below set forth, by level, our financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):

(1)                                     Included in  Cash and cash equivalents  in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets along with $76.3 million and $48.0 million of demand deposits as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
     
  We did not have any transfers between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Our policy is to value all transfers between levels using the beginning of period valuation.  
     
   5.  Derivative Financial Instruments   
     
    Coal Contracts    
     
  We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our exposure to market changes in coal prices.  To manage our exposure in the international markets, we have international coal forward contracts linked to forward Newcastle coal prices.    We use domestic coal futures contracts referenced to the 8800 Btu coal price sold from the PRB, as quoted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ), to help manage our exposure to market changes in domestic coal prices.  
     
  Under the international coal forward contracts, if the monthly average index price is lower than the contract price, we receive the difference, and if the monthly average index price is higher than the contract price, we pay the difference.  For our 2016 positions, we have executed offsetting contracts to lock in the amount we expect to receive each month.  
     
  Under the domestic coal futures contracts, if the monthly average index price is higher than the contract price, we receive the difference, and if the monthly average index price is lower than the contract price, we pay the difference.  Amounts due to us or to the CME as a result of changes in the market price of our open domestic coal futures contracts and to fulfill margin requirements are received or paid through our brokerage bank on a daily basis; therefore, there is no asset or liability on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we held positions that are expected to settle in 2016 (in thousands, except per ton amounts):  

WTI Derivatives    
     
  We use derivative financial instruments, such as collars and swaps, to help manage our exposure to market changes in diesel fuel prices.  The derivatives are indexed to the West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil price as quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  As such, the nature of the derivatives does not directly offset market changes to our diesel costs.

   CLOUD PEAK ENERGY INC.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
  Under a collar agreement, we pay the difference between the monthly average index price and a floor price if the index price is below the floor, and we receive the difference between the ceiling price and the monthly average index price if the index price is above the ceiling price.  No amounts are paid or received if the index price is between the floor and ceiling prices.  While we would not receive the full benefit of price decreases beyond the floor price, the collars mitigate the risk of crude oil price increases and thereby increased diesel costs that would otherwise have a negative impact on our cash flow.  We used collar agreements to fix a portion of our forecasted diesel costs for 2016.  
     
  Under a swap agreement, if the monthly average index price is higher than the swap price, we receive the difference and if the monthly average index price is lower than the swap price, we pay the difference.  We used swap agreements to fix a portion of our forecasted diesel costs for 2016 and all our forecasted diesel costs for 2017.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we were fully hedged for 2016 and 2017 and held the following WTI derivative financial instruments:

See Note 4 for a discussion related to the fair value of derivative financial instruments.  
     
   6.  Impairments   
     
    Goodwill    
     
  During the second quarter of 2015, due to the weak domestic coal market outlook, especially as it related to 8400 Btu coal, coupled with our decision to reduce annual production at the Cordero Rojo Mine, we performed a goodwill impairment assessment.  We determined that the carrying amount of the Cordero Rojo Mine exceeded its estimated fair value.  The implied fair value of the related goodwill, which related to an acquisition completed in 1997, was $0 requiring a $33.4 million impairment charge related to our Owned and Operated Mines segment, which is reflected in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The remaining $2.3 million balance in goodwill relates to our other mines in the Owned and Operated Mines segment.  
     
    Long-Lived Assets    
     
  Due to lower planned production estimates as well as continued weak coal prices, management completed an impairment analysis with respect to each of the mines in our Owned and Operated Mines segment during the second quarter of 2016.  Although the impairment analysis did not indicate any impairment, if the prices of coal continue to remain depressed or if reserves become uneconomic for mining in the future, the long-lived assets in our Owned and Operated Mines segment are at risk for future impairments.  Management is also evaluating certain idled equipment to determine if the associated costs are recoverable during the life of the mine but presently believes that all costs are recoverable.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded impairments of $2.5 million in the Owned and Operated Mines segment, primarily for engineering costs related to the Overland Conveyor project at our Antelope Mine and $2.0 million related to a shovel that we no longer expect to use because of declining production that is part of Other.

(1)                                    The fair value of the senior notes was based on observable market inputs, which are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
     
    Subsequent Event    
     
  On October 17, 2016, our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CPE Resources and Cloud Peak Energy Finance Corp. (collectively, the  Issuers ), completed offers to exchange (the  Exchange Offers ) up to $400 million aggregate principal amount of their outstanding 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the  2019 Notes ) and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024 (the  2024 Notes , together with the 2019 Notes, the  Old Notes ) for new secured 12.00% Second Lien Notes due 2021 to be issued by the Issuers (the  New Secured Notes ) and, in some cases, cash consideration, subject to the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offers.  The primary purposes of the Exchange Offers were to extend the maturity of the 2019 Notes to November 2021, to reduce leverage by capturing the trading discounts on the Old Notes and to further our ongoing efforts to provide sufficient liquidity to manage through depressed industry conditions and better position the capital structure to help facilitate a future extension of the Credit Agreement or new bank facility or other line of credit before the Credit Agreement terminates in February 2019.  
     
  Holders of $237.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and $143.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes tendered such notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers.  On October 17, 2016, the Issuers accepted for exchange all such Old Notes validly tendered, issued $290.4 million aggregate principal amount of New Secured Notes, and made cash payments of $26.0 million in the aggregate (including $7.7 million in accrued and unpaid interest) to tendering holders of the Old Notes.  The transaction resulted in recognition of $4.5 million in expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Upon completion of the Exchange Offers, $62.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and $56.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes remain outstanding.  
     
  The exchanges of the Old Notes for the New Secured Notes were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring.  As the future cash flows of the New Secured Notes were greater than the carrying amount of the Old Notes, no gain was recognized.  The amount of extinguished debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the New Secured Notes using the effective interest method and recognized as a reduction of interest expense.  As a result, our reported interest expense will be significantly less than the contractual cash interest payments throughout the term of the New Secured Notes.  Our current tax attributes are expected to offset any cash tax impacts from the Exchange Offers.

  The following tables reflect the impact the Exchange Offers had on our  Senior notes :  

8.  Asset Retirement Obligations   
     
  Changes in the carrying amount of our asset retirement obligations were as follows (in thousands):  

Revisions to estimated future reclamation cash flows reflect our regular updates to our estimated costs of closure activities throughout the lives of the respective mines and reflect changes in estimates of closure volumes, disturbed acreages, the timing of the reclamation activities, and third-party unit costs as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  Revisions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to our Antelope Mine, Cordero Rojo Mine and Spring Creek Mine were $ 24.9 million, $20.8 million, and $8.1 million, respectively.  These downward revisions were primarily due to extending each of the mine s lives due to lower expected annual production rates, as well as updated equipment and fuel cost guidance issued by the State of Wyoming.  Reductions to asset retirement obligations resulting from such revisions generally result in a corresponding reduction to the related asset retirement costs in  Property, plant and equipment, net , however, if the decrease to the asset retirement obligation exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset retirement costs, the resulting non-cash credit will reduce  Depreciation and depletion  on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  As of September 30, 2016, these revisions reduced the related asset by $17.5 million.   Depreciation and depletion  was reduced by $36.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

  Downward revisions during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to our Antelope Mine, Cordero Rojo Mine, and Spring Creek Mine were $1.7 million, $44.0 million, and $11.9 million, respectively.  These revisions reduced the related asset by $40.8 million as of September 30, 2015.   Depreciation and depletion  was reduced by $16.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   9.  Other Obligations   
     
    Capital Equipment Lease Obligations    
     
  From time to time, we enter into capital leases on equipment under various lease schedules, which are subject to a master lease agreement, and are pre-payable at our option.  Our capital equipment lease obligations are included in  Other liabilities .  Future payments for these obligations are as follows (in thousands):  

Accounts Receivable Securitization Program    
     
  As of   September 30, 2016, we had $29.5 million of available receivable sale capacity under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Program (the  A/R Securitization Program ).    There were no borrowings outstanding under the   A/R Securitization Program   as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
     
    Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility    
     
   On February 21, 2014, Cloud Peak Energy Resources LLC entered into a five-year Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which was amended on September 5, 2014 and September 9, 2016 (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ).  The Credit Agreement provides us with a senior secured revolving credit facility with a capacity of up to $400 million that can be used to borrow funds or obtain letters of credit.    The borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement is reduced by the undrawn face amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding, which may be up to $250 million at any time.   
     
  The September 9, 2016 Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the  Second Amendment ) replaced the quarterly EBITDA-based financial covenants that previously required us to (a) maintain defined minimum levels of interest coverage and (b) comply with a maximum net secured debt leverage ratio.  These financial covenants were replaced with a new monthly minimum liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain liquidity, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of not less than $125 million as of the last day of each month.  The Second Amendment reduced the maximum borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement to $400 million, from the previous maximum capacity of $500 million.  It also revised the permitted debt covenant and permitted lien covenant to allow the issuance of second lien debt in an amount up to $350 million.  Additionally, it revised various negative covenants and baskets that would apply to, among other things, the incurrence of debt, making investments, asset dispositions and restricted payments.  Lastly, it established a requirement for deposit account control agreements with the administrative agent for certain of our deposit accounts.  The Second Amendment did not change the maturity of the Credit Agreement, which remains February 21, 2019.

  Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin of 3.50%.  We pay the lenders a commitment fee of 0.50% per year on the unused amount of the Credit Agreement.  Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, unless drawn upon, will incur a per annum fee from the date at which they are issued of 3.50%.  Letters of credit that are drawn upon   may be converted to loans at our request, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth in the Credit Agreement.  In addition, in connection with the issuance of a letter of credit, we are required to pay the issuing bank a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum.  
     
  As of   September 30, 2016, we had   no borrowings and the undrawn face amount of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement was $71.3 million.  As of   December 31, 2015  , there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  We were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  .  
     
    Liquidity    
     
  Our aggregate availability for borrowing under the Credit Agreement and the A/R Securitization Program was approximately $  358.2   million as of   September 30, 2016.    Our total liquidity, which includes cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under both our Credit Agreement and the A/R Securitization Program, was $448.5 million as of September 30, 2016.  
     
    Debt Issuance Costs    
     
  Debt issuance costs of $1.3 million related to the decrease in the Credit Agreement s borrowing capacity were written off in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Debt issuance costs of $3.6 million were incurred in connection with the Second Amendment.  These costs were deferred and are being amortized to  Interest expense  over the remaining term of the Credit Agreement.  There were $8.6 million and $8.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,   related to the A/R Securitization Program and the Credit Agreement included in noncurrent  Other assets .  
     
   10.  Commitments and Contingencies   
     
    Commitments    
     
   Purchase Commitments   
     
  We   had outstanding purchase commitments consisting of the following (in thousands):  

(1)                                     This land transaction was completed during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The contract was modified to reduce the number of acres and related total payment to $11.5 million.  
  (2)                                     Includes undiscounted port take-or-pay commitments through the remaining term of the agreement in 2024.  Reflects the 2016-2018 amendment entered in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Assumes we do not ship any export tons, and does not include throughput or other charges based on any actual shipments.

  (3)                                     Includes undiscounted rail take-or-pay commitments, if we exercise our contractual buyout option in 2019, which requires one year s notice plus a lump sum payment.  Reflects the 2016-2018 amendment entered in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Assumes we do not ship any export tons, and does not include transportation or other charges based on any actual shipments.  The full term of the agreement continues through 2024.  Assuming we did not exercise our buyout option in 2019 and did not meet minimum shipment requirements, we would owe additional take-or-pay amounts through the remaining term of the agreement.  
     
    Contingencies    
     
   Litigation   
     
   WildEarth Guardians  and Northern Plains Resource Council s Regulatory Challenge to OSM s Approval Process for Mine Plans   
     
   Background    On February 27, 2013, WildEarth Guardians ( WildEarth ) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado ( Colorado District Court ) challenging the federal Office of Surface Mining s ( OSM ) approvals of mine plans for seven different coal mines located in four different states.  The challenged approvals included two that were issued to subsidiaries of Cloud Peak Energy: one for the Cordero Rojo Mine in Wyoming and one for the Spring Creek Mine in Montana.  
     
  On February 7, 2014, the Colorado District Court severed the claims in WildEarth s complaint and transferred all the claims pertaining to non-Colorado mines to the federal district courts for the states in which the mines were located.  Pursuant to this order, the challenge to Cordero Rojo s mine plan approval (along with challenges to two other OSM approvals) was transferred to the United States District Court in Wyoming ( Wyoming District Court ) and the challenge to Spring Creek s mine plan approval was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Montana ( Montana District Court ).  On February 14, 2014, WildEarth voluntarily dismissed the case pending in the Wyoming District Court, thereby concluding its challenge to OSM s approval of the Cordero Rojo mine plan.  WildEarth has continued to pursue its challenges to mine plan approvals pending in district courts in Colorado, New Mexico, and Montana.  
     
  On March 14, 2014, WildEarth amended its complaint in the Montana District Court to reflect the transfer order from the Colorado District Court.  WildEarth has asked the Montana District Court to vacate OSM s 2012 approval of the Spring Creek mine plan and enjoin mining operations at the Spring Creek Mine until OSM undertakes additional environmental analysis and related public process requested by WildEarth.  
     
  On August 14, 2014, Northern Plains Resource Council and the Western Organization of Resource Councils (collectively  Northern Plains ) filed a complaint in the Montana District Court challenging the same OSM approval of Spring Creek s mine plan.  Northern Plains, like WildEarth, requested that the Montana District Court vacate OSM s 2012 approval of the Spring Creek mine plan and enjoin mining operations at the Spring Creek Mine until OSM undertakes the additional analysis requested by Northern Plains.  
     
   Intervention by Cloud Peak Energy and Others    By orders dated May 30, 2014, May 9, 2014, and April 28, 2014, the Montana District Court granted intervention to the State of Montana, the National Mining Association, and Spring Creek Coal LLC, a 100% owned subsidiary of Cloud Peak Energy, respectively.  Each of these parties intervened on the side of OSM.  
     
   Current Schedule   On October 28, 2014, the Montana District Court consolidated the WildEarth and Northern Plains cases and set a briefing schedule for resolution of all of WildEarth s and Northern Plains  claims through motions for summary judgment.  Plaintiffs filed their opening briefs on December 8, 2014, and under a revised schedule, briefing by all parties was completed on May 7, 2015.  The Montana District Court held an oral argument on July 31, 2015 before a Magistrate Judge in Billings, Montana.  At the conclusion of the oral argument, the Magistrate Judge ordered the parties to negotiate and attempt to resolve this dispute by agreement of the parties.  In October 2015, the parties jointly submitted a status report to the Montana District Court stating they were unable to reach a settlement.  On October 23, 2015, the Magistrate Judge issued her findings and recommendations to the District Court Judge.  In this order, the Magistrate found

   CLOUD PEAK ENERGY INC.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
  that OSM had failed to follow the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to provide notice to the public when the agency had completed its environmental analysis and by failing to explain how OSM concluded that its approval of the 2012 mining plan would have no significant environmental impacts.  Based on these findings, the Magistrate further recommended that OSM be directed to prepare a supplemental environmental analysis within 180 days from the date the Montana District Court issues a final judgment.  Under the Magistrate s recommendation, mining at the Spring Creek mine would proceed unabated during the time OSM is undertaking its supplemental analysis.  The mining plan for the Spring Creek Mine would not be vacated unless OSM failed to complete its supplemental analysis within 180 days.  
     
  On November 6, 2015, Spring Creek Coal, the National Mining Association and the State of Montana filed objections to the Magistrate s findings and recommendations.  The federal defendants filed limited objections on that same day.  WildEarth and Northern Plains filed responses to these objections on November 17, 2015 and November 20, 2015, respectively.  On January 21, 2016, the Montana District Court issued an order adopting most of the Magistrate s findings and recommendations, but provided OSM 240 days (rather than 180 days) to prepare a supplemental environmental analysis.  Under the Montana District Court s order, mining at the Spring Creek mine would proceed unabated during the time OSM is undertaking its supplemental analysis and OSM was ordered to submit monthly status reports informing the court and the parties of OSM s progress in preparing the analysis.  The mining plan for the Spring Creek Mine would not be vacated unless OSM fails to complete its supplemental analysis within 240 days.  The order provides that OSM may request and obtain additional time to prepare its analysis  for good cause.   On June 27, 2016, the Montana District Court granted a joint motion by Plaintiff Northern Plains and OSM to extend the compliance deadline from 240 days to 256 days.  On October 3, 2016, OSM notified the Montana District Court that OSM had completed its supplemental environmental analysis and issued a new decision on October 3, 2016 re-approving the 2012 mine plan for the Spring Creek Mine.  OSM s decision and accompanying environmental assessment satisfies the Court s January 21, 2016 remedy order.  On October 19, 2016, the Court found that OSM had complied with the Court s January 21, 2016 remedy order and entered a final judgment in the case.  
     
   Administrative Appeals of the BLM s Approval of the Potential West Antelope II South Lease Modification   
     
   Background    On September 5, 2014, WildEarth filed an appeal with the Interior Board of Land Appeals ( IBLA ) challenging the BLM s August 15, 2014 decision to approve Antelope Coal LLC s proposed modification of Antelope Coal s West Antelope II South ( WAII South ) lease.  Antelope Coal is a 100% owned subsidiary of Cloud Peak Energy.  On September 12, 2014, Powder River Basin Resource Council and Sierra Club (collectively  PRBRC ) filed an appeal with the IBLA challenging this same BLM decision.  The BLM s decision that is the subject of both appeals approves the proposed amendment of WAII South lease.  If the lease modification is entered into, it would add approximately 15.8 million tons of coal underlying nearly 857 surface acres.  WildEarth and PRBRC have asked the IBLA to vacate the proposed WAII South lease modification and direct the BLM to prepare additional environmental analysis on the impacts of the lease modification.  
     
   Intervention by Cloud Peak Energy and State of Wyoming    On September 24, 2014 and October 6, 2014, Antelope Coal and the State of Wyoming, respectively, moved to intervene in the WildEarth and PRBRC appeals as respondents to defend the BLM s lease modification decision.  The IBLA granted these intervention motions.  
     
   Current Schedule   .  WildEarth filed its Statement of Reasons (opening brief) on October 6, 2014, and PRBRC filed its Statement of Reasons on October 10, 2014.  The BLM filed its Answer (opposition brief) on January 12, 2015 and moved for the two appeals to be consolidated.  Antelope Coal and State of Wyoming filed their respective Answers on January 20, 2015.  Briefing has been completed in both appeals.  On September 2, 2016, WildEarth filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority indicating that decisions in three unrelated IBLA appeals call into question whether BLM s decision record approving the WAII South LBM was signed by the appropriate BLM official.  In response to a September 12, 2016 Show Cause Order from the IBLA, BLM filed a response brief on September 26, 2016 representing that the High Plains District Manager had properly signed the decision record approving the WAII South LBM.  Antelope Coal and the State of Wyoming filed briefs in support of BLM s response on September 27, 2016 and September 30, 2016 respectively.  The parties are awaiting a decision from the IBLA.  We believe the WildEarth and PRBRC appeals challenging the BLM s West Antelope II South lease modification decision are without merit.  Nevertheless, if the plaintiff s claims are successful, the timing and ability of Cloud Peak Energy to lease and mine the coal underlying the applicable surface acres would be materially adversely impacted.   We are unable to estimate a loss or range of loss for this contingency because (1) the challenge does not

   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
  seek monetary relief, (2) the nature of the relief sought is to require the regulatory agency to address alleged deficiencies in complying with applicable regulatory and legal requirements and (3) even if the challenges are successful in whole or in part, the IBLA has broad discretion in determining the nature of the relief ultimately granted.  
     
   WildEarth Guardians  Regulatory Challenge to OSM s Approval Process for Antelope Mine Plan   
     
   Background    On September 15, 2015, WildEarth   filed a complaint in the Colorado District Court challenging the Department of Interior s and Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement s (collectively,  OSM ) approvals of mine plans for four different coal mines, one of which is located in Colorado and three of which are located in Wyoming.  The challenged approvals included one mine plan modification that was issued to Antelope Coal LLC, a subsidiary of Cloud Peak Energy, for the Antelope Mine in Wyoming.   The plaintiff seeks to vacate existing, required regulatory approvals and to enjoin mining operations at Antelope Mine.  
     
   Intervention by Cloud Peak Energy and Others    The State of Wyoming and all the operators of the mines whose mine plans are being challenged have moved to intervene as Defendants to defend the challenged mine plans.  The prospective intervenors filed their motions on the following dates:  State of Wyoming (November 12, 2015), Antelope Coal LLC (November 13, 2015), New Mexico Coal Resources, LLC (November 16, 2015), Bowie Resources, LLC (November 24, 2015), Thunder Basin Coal, L.L.C. (December 4, 2015).  
     
   Current Schedule    On November 25, 2015, the OSM filed a motion to sever WildEarth s complaint and transfer those claims against the two Wyoming mines (Antelope and Black Thunder) to the District of Wyoming and the New Mexico mine (El Segundo) to the District of New Mexico.  Each of the prospective intervenors filed conditional responses in support of OSM s transfer motion.  On January 7, 2016, WildEarth filed its opposition to OSM s transfer motion.  On January 29, 2016, WildEarth and OSM filed a Joint Motion to Stay all proceedings for 60 days in order for the parties to pursue settlement discussions.  On February 1, 2016, the prospective intervenors filed a proposed response to the stay motion in which they asked the Colorado District Court to grant (1) the pending intervention motions, and (2) the pending motion to sever transfer, before staying the portion of the case that remained in the District of Colorado.  On February 3, 2016, WildEarth and OSM filed separate reply briefs in support of their stay motion.  On February 16, 2016, the court granted the motion to stay the case for 60 days, and on February 18, 2016, the court granted the pending motions to intervene by Antelope, the State of Wyoming, and the other coal producers.  The stay expired on April 1, 2016 after the parties were unable to reach a voluntary settlement and OSM filed its reply brief in support of its motion to sever and transfer on April 11, 2016.  On June 17, 2016, the Colorado District Court granted OSM s motion to sever and transfer WildEarth s claims against the Antelope and Black Thunder mine plans to the District of Wyoming and the El Segundo mine plan to the District of New Mexico.  The challenges against the Antelope and Black Thunder mine plans, which are docketed as separate cases, have both been assigned to Judge Johnson of the District of Wyoming.  On October 7, 2016, BLM filed its administrative record for the case challenging the Antelope mine plan.  On October 21, 2016, WildEarth filed a motion to supplement the administrative record with three administrative documents prepared by other federal agencies.  OSM has until November 4, 2016 to file its opposition brief and WildEarth has until November 11, 2016 to file its reply brief.  After briefing is completed, the Court will either order OSM to supplement the administrative record with one or more of the three documents requested by WildEarth, or will deny the motion in its entirety.  WildEarth s opening merits brief will be due 45 days after either (a) an amended administrative record is filed by OSM, or (b) the Court denies WildEarth s motion to supplement.  Opposition briefs by OSM and Antelope Coal would be due 45 days after WildEarth s opening merits brief is filed.  
     
  We believe WildEarth s challenge is without merit.  Nevertheless, if WildEarth s claims against OSM s approval of the Antelope mine plan modification are successful, any court order granting the requested relief could have a material adverse impact on our shipments, financial results and liquidity, and could result in claims from third parties if we are unable to meet our commitments under pre-existing commercial agreements as a result of any required reductions or modifications to our mining activities.   We are unable to estimate a loss or range of loss for this contingency because (1) the challenge does not seek monetary relief, (2) the nature of the relief sought is to require the regulatory agency to address alleged deficiencies in complying with applicable regulatory and legal requirements and (3) even if the challenges are successful in whole or in part, the court has broad discretion in determining the nature of the relief ultimately granted.

   Other Legal Proceedings   
     
  We are involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and may become involved in additional proceedings from time to time.  We believe that there are no other legal proceedings pending that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Nevertheless, we cannot predict the impact of future developments affecting our claims and lawsuits, and any resolution of a claim or lawsuit or an accrual within a particular fiscal period may materially and adversely impact our results of operations for that period.  In addition to claims and lawsuits against us, our LBAs,   lease by modifications  , permits, and other industry regulatory processes and approvals, including those applicable to the utility and coal logistics and transportation industries, may also continue to be subject to legal challenges that could materially and adversely impact our mining operations, results and liquidity.  These regulatory challenges may seek to vacate prior regulatory decisions and authorizations that are legally required for some or all of our current or planned mining activities.  If we are required to reduce or modify our mining activities as a result of these challenges, the impact could   have a material adverse effect on our shipments, financial results and liquidity, and could result in claims from third parties if we are unable to meet our commitments under pre-existing commercial agreements as a result of any such required reductions or modifications to our mining activities.  
     
   Tax Contingencies   
     
  Our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective U.S. federal or state tax laws.  Our tax filings, however, are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities.  Accordingly, we recognize tax benefits when it is more likely than not a position will be upheld by the tax authorities.  To the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts originally accrued, the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense.  
     
  Several non-income based production tax audits related to federal and state royalties and severance taxes are currently in progress.  The financial statements reflect our best estimate of taxes and related interest and penalties due for potential adjustments that may result from the resolution of such tax audits.  From time to time, we receive audit assessments and engage in settlement discussions with applicable tax authorities, which may result in adjustments to our estimates of taxes and related interest and penalties.  
     
   Concentrations of Risk and Major Customers   
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was one customer that represented 10% or more of consolidated revenue.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, there was no single customer that represented 10% or more of consolidated revenue.  We generally do not require collateral or other security on accounts receivable because our customers are comprised primarily of investment grade electric utilities.  The credit risk is controlled through credit approvals and monitoring procedures.  
     
   Guarantees and Off-Balance Sheet Risk   
     
  In the normal course of business, we are party to guarantees and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, performance or surety bonds and indemnities, which are not reflected on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  In our past experience, virtually no claims have been made against these financial instruments.  Management does not expect any material losses to result from these guarantees or off-balance sheet instruments.  
     
   U.S. federal and state laws require we secure certain of our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining and to secure coal lease obligations.  We currently use self-bonding to secure performance of certain obligations in Wyoming.  Self-bonding has allowed us to use the strength of our financial positions as security rather than obtaining a traditional surety bond.    Specific bond and/or letter of credit amounts may change over time, depending on the activity at the respective site and any specific requirements by federal or state laws.  As of September 30, 2016, we were self-bonded for $190 million and had $448.9 million of reclamation bonds backed by collateral of $71.3 million in the form of letters of credit under our Credit Agreement used for mining, secure coal lease obligations, and for other operating requirements.  We have received approval from the Land Quality Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality to lower the total bonding

  requirements by $154 million.    Although we currently expect to be able to achieve our goal of exiting self-bonding by January 2017, the timing of its completion is dependent on the State of Wyoming s processing and approval of our applications, and is therefore, uncertain.  
     
   11.  Postretirement Medical Plan   
     
  We maintain an unfunded postretirement medical plan to provide certain postretirement medical benefits to eligible employees.  Net periodic postretirement benefit costs included the following components (in thousands):  

In April 2016, we communicated a change in our Retiree Medical Plan to employees that becomes effective January 1, 2017.  Changes include a decrease in the number of active employees that are eligible for the plan as well as moving to a defined contribution plan away from a defined benefit plan.  These plan changes reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $47.7 million   during the second quarter of 2016.     The plan changes eliminated the old prior service cost base and established a new negative prior service cost base of approximately $41.1 million, which will be amortized to income over 4.2 years.  
     
   12.  Income Taxes   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had deferred tax assets principally arising from: ARO, alternative minimum tax credits, pension and postretirement benefits, contract rights, and net operating loss carry-forwards for income tax purposes multiplied by an expected rate of 37%.  As management cannot determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset has been established at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate is due to the impact of percentage depletion, income tax in the states in which we do business, changes in our valuation allowance and the impact of out of period adjustments.  In addition, the adjustments to ARO and the retiree medical plan, while incurring a loss during the period, substantially impacted our effective rate for 2016. Our effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was 28.3%.  Our effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was 66.1%.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no material unrecognized tax benefits. There was no change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during the year or in prior periods or due to settlements with taxing authorities or lapses of applicable statues of limitations.  We are open to federal and state tax audits until the applicable statutes of limitations expire.

15.  Segment Information   
     
  We have two reportable segments; our   Owned and Operated Mines segment and our Logistics and Related Activities segment.  
     
  Our Owned and Operated Mines segment is characterized by the predominant focus on thermal coal production where the sale occurs at the mine site and where title and risk of loss generally pass to the customer at that point.  This segment includes our Antelope Mine, Cordero Rojo Mine, and Spring Creek Mine.  Sales in this segment are primarily to domestic electric utilities, although a portion may be made to our Logistics and Related Activities segment.  S  ales between reportable segments are priced based on prevailing market prices for arm s length transactions.    Our mines utilize surface mining extraction processes and are all located in the PRB.  The gains and losses resulting from our domestic coal futures contracts and WTI derivative financial instruments are reported within this segment.  
     
  Our Logistics and Related Activities segment is characterized by the services we provide to our international and certain of our domestic customers where we deliver coal to the customer at a terminal or the customer s plant or other delivery point, remote from our mine site.    Services provided include the purchase of coal from third parties or from our Owned and Operated Mines segment, at market prices, as well as the contracting and coordination of the transportation and other handling services from third-party operators, which are typically rail and terminal companies.    Title and risk of loss are retained by the Logistics and Related Activities segment through the transportation and delivery process.  Title and risk of loss pass to the customer in accordance with the contract and typically occur at a vessel loading terminal, a vessel unloading terminal or an end use facility.  Risk associated with rail and terminal take-or-pay agreements is also borne by the Logistics and Related Activities segment.  The gains and losses resulting from our international coal forward contracts and international coal put options are reported within this segment.  Amortization related to port access rights prior to the fourth quarter 2015 impairment and the amended port and rail take-or-pay agreements are also included in this segment.  Losses associated with our investment in the Gateway Pacific Terminal are included in our Logistics and Related Activities segment.  
     
  Our business activities that are not considered operating segments are included in Other although they are not required to be included in this footnote.  They are provided for reconciliation purposes and include  Selling, general and administrative expenses  ( SG A ) as well as results relating to broker activity.

  Eliminations represent the purchase and sale of coal between reportable segments and the associated elimination of intercompany profit or loss in inventory and are provided for reconciliation purposes.  
     
  Segment results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been retrospectively revised to reflect our new measure of segment profitability first presented in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
     
  EBITDA represents net income (loss) before: (1) interest income (expense) net, (2) income tax provision, (3) depreciation and depletion, and (4) amortization.  Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for accretion, which represents non-cash increases in asset retirement obligation liabilities resulting from the passage of time, and specifically identified items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations.  For the periods presented herein, the specifically identified items are:  (1) adjustments to exclude non-cash impairment charges, (2) adjustments for derivative financial instruments, excluding fair value mark-to-market gains or losses and including cash amounts received or paid, and (3) adjustments to exclude debt restructuring costs.  We enter into certain derivative financial instruments such as put options that require the payment of premiums at contract inception.  The reduction in the premium value over time is reflected in the mark-to-market gains or losses.  Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA does not include premiums paid for derivative financial instruments; either at contract inception, as these payments pertain to future settlement periods, or in the period of contract settlement, as the payment occurred in a preceding period.

16.  Equity-Based Compensation   
     
  Our LTIP permits awards to our employees and eligible non-employee directors, which we generally grant in the first quarter of each year.  The LTIP allows for the issuance of equity-based compensation in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units, options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance awards, and share awards.  At our 2016 annual meeting, shareholders approved an additional 1.6 million shares available for issuance under the LTIP.  As of September 30, 2016, approximately 1.7 million shares were available for grant, depending on the actual performance and vesting of outstanding awards.  
     
  Generally, each form of equity-based compensation awarded to eligible employees cliff vests on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to meeting any applicable performance criteria for the award.  However, the awards will pro-rata vest sooner if an employee terminates employment with or stops providing services to us because of death,  disability,   redundancy  or  retirement  (as such terms are defined in the award agreement or the LTIP, as applicable), or if an employee subject to an employment agreement is terminated by us for any reason other than for  cause  or leaves for  good reason  (as such terms are defined in the relevant employment agreement).  In addition, the awards will fully vest if an employee is terminated without cause (or leaves for good reason, if the employee is subject to an employment agreement) within two years after a  change in control  (as such term is defined in the LTIP) occurs.  
     
    Restricted Stock Units    
     
  We have granted restricted stock units under the LTIP to eligible employees and non-employee directors.  The restricted stock units granted to our directors generally vest upon their resignation or retirement (except for a removal for cause) or upon certain events constituting a  change in control  (as such term is defined in the award agreement).  They will pro-rata vest if a director resigns or retires within one year of the date of grant.  
     
  A summary of restricted stock unit award activity is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

   CLOUD PEAK ENERGY INC.   
   NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
     
  As of   September 30, 2016, unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards was $3.8 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years prior to vesting.  
     
    Performance Share Units    
     
  Performance share units represent the right to receive a number of shares of common stock (or the equivalent cash value thereof) based on the achievement of targeted performance levels related to pre-established total stockholder return goals over a three-year period, and pay out may range from 0% to 200% of the targeted share number.  
     
  In previous years, the performance-based units were settled in shares of common stock and the grant date fair value of the awards was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation and amortized over the performance period.  The 2016 grants are expected to be settled in cash and therefore, will be accounted for as a liability and marked to market on a quarterly basis.  
     
  The weighted-average grant date fair values of the performance share units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.95 and $9.66 per share, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, $20.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost, which represents the unvested portion of the fair market value of performance share units granted, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.3 years.  
     
  A summary of performance share unit award activity is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):  

17.  Supplemental Guarantor/Non-Guarantor Financial Information

   CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS     
     
  This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.  You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   should,   will,   would,  or similar words.  You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our current plans, strategies, prospects, and expectations concerning our business, operating results, financial condition, and other similar matters.  While we believe that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately or control, and there can be no assurance that future developments affecting our business will be those that we anticipate.  Additionally, all statements concerning our expectations regarding future operating results are based on current forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions.  The factors listed under  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (our  2015 Form 10-K ) and Item 1A of Part II of this report, as well as any other cautionary language in this report, describe the known material risks, uncertainties, and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements.  Additional factors or events that may emerge from time to time, or those that we currently deem to be immaterial, could cause our actual results to differ, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them.  You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein.  We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.  The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from our forward-looking statements:  
     
                        the timing and extent of any recovery of the currently depressed coal industry, domestically and internationally, and the impact of ongoing or further depressed industry conditions on our financial performance, liquidity and financial covenant compliance; 
     
                        the prices we receive for our coal and logistics services, our ability to effectively execute our forward sales strategy, and changes in utility purchasing patterns resulting in decreased long term purchases of coal; 
     
                        timing of reductions or increases in customer coal inventories; 
     
                        our ability to renew sales contracts on favorable terms and to resolve customer requests for reductions or deferrals and respond to cancellations of their committed volumes on terms that preserve the amount and timing of our forecasted economic value; 
     
                        the impact of increasingly variable and less predictable demand for thermal coal based on natural gas prices, summer cooling demand, winter heating demand, economic growth rates and other factors that impact overall demand for electricity; 
     
                        our ability to efficiently and safely conduct our mining operations and to adjust our planned production levels to respond to market conditions and effectively manage the costs of our operations; 
     
                        competition with other producers of coal and with traders and re-sellers of coal, including the current oversupply of thermal coal in the marketplace, the impacts of currency exchange rate fluctuations and the strong U.S. dollar, and government environmental, energy and tax policies and regulations that make foreign coal producers more competitive for international transactions; 
     
                        the impact of coal industry bankruptcies on our competitive position relative to other companies who may emerge from bankruptcy with potentially reduced leverage and operating costs; 
     
                        competition with natural gas, wind, solar and other non-coal energy resources, which may continue to increase as a result of low domestic natural gas prices and due to environmental, energy and tax policies, regulations, subsidies and other government actions that encourage or mandate use of alternative energy sources; 
     
                        coal-fired power plant capacity and utilization, including the impact of climate change and other environmental regulations and initiatives, energy policies, political pressures, NGO activities, international treaties or agreements

                        our ability to offset declining U.S. demand for coal and achieve longer term growth in our business through our logistics revenue and export sales, including the significant impact of Chinese and Indian thermal coal import demand on overall seaborne coal prices; 
     
                        railroad, export terminal and other transportation performance, costs and availability, including the availability of sufficient and reliable rail capacity to transport PRB coal, the development of future export terminal capacity and our ability to access capacity on commercially reasonable terms; 
     
                        the impact of our substantial rail and terminal take-or-pay commitments and other contractual obligations if we do not meet our required export shipment obligations; 
     
                        weather conditions and weather-related damage that impact our mining operations, our customers, or transportation infrastructure;

   Explanatory Note   
     
  This Item 2 may contain forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.  When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and our other Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filings, including the Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 Form 10-K )   and Item 1A of Part II of this report  .  Please see  Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  in Item 1 above.  
     
  This Item 2 is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of this report and our other SEC filings, including our audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K.  
     
   Overview   
     
  We are one of the largest producers of coal in the United States of America ( U.S. ) and the Powder River Basin ( PRB ), based on our 2015 coal sales.  We operate some of the safest mines in the coal industry.  According to the most current Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) data, we have one of the lowest employee all injury incident rates among the largest U.S. coal producing companies.    We currently operate solely in the PRB, the lowest cost region of the major coal producing regions in the U.S., where we own and operate three surface coal mines: the Antelope Mine, the Cordero Rojo Mine, and the Spring Creek Mine.  
     
  Our Antelope Mine and Cordero Rojo Mine are located in Wyoming and our Spring Creek Mine is located in Montana.  Our mines produce subbituminous thermal coal with low sulfur content, and we sell our coal primarily to domestic electric utilities.  Thermal coal is primarily consumed by electric utilities and industrial consumers as fuel for electricity generation.  In 2015, the coal we produced generated approximately 3% of the electricity produced in the U.S.  We do not produce any metallurgical coal.    As of December 31, 2015, we controlled approximately 1.1 billion tons of proven and probable reserves.  
     
  In addition, we have two development projects.  The Youngs Creek project, an undeveloped surface mine project in the Northern PRB region, is located in Wyoming, approximately 13 miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming, seven miles south of our Spring Creek Mine and seven miles from the mainline railroad, contiguous with the Wyoming-Montana state line.  We have not been able to classify the Youngs Creek project mineral rights as proven and probable reserves as they remain subject to further exploration and evaluation based on market conditions.  We also have an option to lease agreement and a corresponding exploration agreement with the Crow Tribe of Indians (the  Big Metal project ).  The Big Metal project is located on the Crow Indian Reservation in southeast Montana and is near the Youngs Creek project.  We are in the process of evaluating development options for the Youngs Creek project and the Big Metal project and believe that their proximity to the Spring Creek Mine represents an opportunity to optimize our mine developments in the Northern PRB.  For purposes of this report, the term  Northern PRB  refers to the area within the PRB that lies within Montana and the northern part of Sheridan County, Wyoming.  
     
  In 2015, we amended agreements with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership ( Westshore ) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway ( BNSF ) providing for reduced quarterly take-or-pay payments from 2016 through 2018.  We meet regularly with Westshore and BNSF to discuss market conditions, potential shipments, and the terms for such shipments.  The recent increase in seaborne thermal coal pricing has enabled us to begin contracting export shipments for delivery between November 2016 and February 2017.  Shipments will directly offset the amended take-or-pay obligations on a ton-for-ton basis.  
     
   Segment Information   
     
  Our reportable segments include Owned and Operated Mines and Logistics and Related Activities.  For a discussion of these segments, please see Note 15 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.

   Core Business Operations   
     
  Our key business drivers include the following:  
     
                        the volume of coal sold by our Owned and Operated Mines segment; 
     
                        the price for which we sell our coal; 
     
                        the costs of mining, including labor, repairs and maintenance, fuel, explosives, depreciation of capital equipment, and depletion of coal leases; 
     
                        capital expenditures to acquire property, plant and equipment; 
     
                        the volume of deliveries coordinated by our Logistics and Related Activities segment to customer contracted destinations; 
     
                        the revenue we receive for our logistics services; 
     
                        the costs for logistics services, rail and port charges for coal sales made on a delivered basis, including demurrage and any take-or-pay charges; and 
     
                        the results of our derivative financial instruments. 
     
  The volume of coal that we sell in any given year is driven by global and domestic demand for coal-generated electric power.  Demand for coal-generated electric power may be affected by many factors including weather patterns, natural gas prices, railroad performance, the availability of coal-fired and alternative generating capacity and utilization, environmental and legal challenges, political and regulatory factors, energy policies, international and domestic economic conditions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other factors discussed in this Item 2 and in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
     
   The price at which we sell our coal is a function of the demand for coal relative to the supply.  We typically seek to enter into multi-year contracts with our customers, which helps mitigate the risks associated with any short-term imbalance in supply and demand.   We typically  seek to enter each year with expected production effectively fully sold.  This strategy helps us run our mines at predictable production rates, which improves control of operating costs.  In recent years, our business has become more variable and less predictable. 
     
  As is common in the PRB, coal seams at our existing mines naturally deepen, resulting in additional overburden to be removed at additional cost.  We have experienced increased operating costs for longer haul distances, maintenance and supplies, and employee wages and salaries.  We use derivative financial instruments to help manage our exposure to diesel fuel prices.  
     
  We incur significant capital expenditures to maintain, update and expand our mining equipment, surface land holdings and coal reserves.  As the costs of acquiring federal coal leases and associated surface rights increase, our depletion costs also increase.  
     
  The volume of coal sold on a delivered basis is influenced by international and domestic market conditions.   Coal sold on a delivered basis to customer contracted destinations, including sales to Asian customers, involves us arranging and paying for logistics services, which can include rail, rail car hire, and port charges, including any demurrage incurred and other costs.  These logistics costs are affected by volume, various scheduling considerations, and negotiated rates for rail and port services.  We have exposure to take-or-pay obligations for our rail and port committed capacities. 
     
  We entered into coal forward and futures contracts that are scheduled to settle at various dates through 2016 to hedge a portion of our export and domestic coal sales prices.  We have also entered into WTI derivative financial instruments to hedge our diesel fuel costs.

   Current Considerations   
     
    Owned and Operated Mines Segment    
     
  Strong summer electricity demand and increased natural gas prices caused many of our customers to operate their coal units at full capacity.  This increase in consumption resulted in customers drawing down their inventories and focusing on taking their contracted coal this year.  
     
  Shipments improved during the third quarter, as expected, with our shipments being 44% higher than the prior quarter.  However, year-to-date shipments remain 26% lower than 2015 through due to the very slow first half of 2016.  Preliminary data from MSHA indicates that the third quarter and year-to-date coal production in the U.S. was down 19% and 24%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.  Through July 2016, electric generation was down 1.6% year-over-year but has steadily increased during the third quarter of 2016.  
     
    Logistics and Related Activities Segment    
     
  The recent increase of seaborne thermal coal pricing has enabled us to begin contracting export shipments.  We have scheduled approximately one million tons of exports for delivery between November 2016 and February 2017.  Shipments will directly offset the amended take-or-pay obligations on a ton-for-ton basis.  
     
    Potential for Asset Impairments    
     
  The carrying value of our mineral properties, equipment, and other long-lived assets are sensitive to declines in domestic and international coal prices.  These assets are at risk of impairment if prices remain at current levels for an extended period of time or do not recover as anticipated, or if regulatory changes adversely impact coal-fired electricity generation.  The cash flow model that we use to assess impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as our current estimates of forecast coal production, market outlook on forward commodity prices, operating and development costs, and discount rates.  All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date of estimate.  Forward commodity prices in mid-October 2016 have increased slightly subsequent to the test for impairment as of June 30, 2016.  If forward prices remain at these levels, or further decline, we have long-lived assets at risk for impairment.  The actual amount of impairment incurred, if any, for our properties will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, subsequent forward price curve changes, the additional risk-adjusted value of proven and probable reserves, weighted-average cost of capital, operating cost estimates and future capital expenditure estimates.  
     
   Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters   
     
  Federal, state and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to various matters, including air quality standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, the discharge of materials into the environment and the effects of mining on surface and groundwater quality and availability.  These laws and regulations have had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our production costs and our competitive position  relative to certain other sources of electricity generation.  Future laws, regulations or orders, including those relating to global climate change, may cause coal to become a less attractive fuel source, thereby further reducing coal s share of the market for fuels and other energy sources used to generate electricity.  For example, on June 29, 2016, President Barack Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto made a trilateral energy and climate announcement during the North American Leadership Summit in Ottawa, which included the North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership Action Plan. This Plan includes goals, such as striving to achieve 50% clean power generation by 2025 for North America, and reducing black carbon (soot). At this time, we cannot predict what steps, if any, these countries will take towards meeting these goals.  If this Plan results in additional regulations of our business, or results in policies favoring other forms of energy, then our business could be adversely impacted.  See  Climate Change Regulatory Environment  below and Part I Item I. Business  Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters  in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional climate disclosures. 
     
  In August 2015, the EPA issued its final CPP rules that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called CO2 emission performance rates.  The EPA expects each state to develop implementation plans for power plants in its state to meet the individual state targets established in the CPP.  The EPA has given states the option to develop compliance plans for annual rate-based reductions (pounds per megawatt hour) or mass-based tonnage limits for CO2.  The EPA also proposed  
     
 39   

Table of Contents   
     
  a federal compliance plan to implement the CPP in the event that an approvable state plan is not submitted to the EPA.  Judicial challenges have been filed. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the CPP before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ( Circuit Court ) issued a final decision.  By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court if any certiorari petition is granted.   The stay suspends the rule, including the requirement that states submit their initial plans by September 2016.  The Supreme Court s stay applies only to EPA s regulations for CO2 emissions from existing power plants and will not affect EPA s standards for new power plants.  It is not yet clear how either the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court will rule on the legality of the CPP.  If the rules were upheld at the conclusion of this appellate process and are implemented in their current form, then demand for coal will likely be further decreased, potentially significantly, and adversely impact our business.  
     
  During the stay, the EPA has continued to move forward with certain aspects of the program.  For example, on June 16, 2016, the EPA published a proposed rule outlining certain design details for the optional Clean Energy Incentive Program ( CEIP ), which would reward early investments in renewable energy generation and demand-side energy efficiency measures that generate carbon-free megawatt hours or reduce end-use energy demand during 2020 and/or 2021.  Once finalized, EPA intends these design elements to help guide states and tribes that choose to participate in the CEIP should the CPP become effective at the conclusion of the various legal challenges.  State participation in the program would be optional.  If the CPP is upheld and states decide to participate in the CEIP, then it could create a competitive advantage for other forms of energy used for electric generation relative to our business.  
     
  On January 15, 2016, the Secretary of the DOI announced a moratorium on the issuance of new leases for coal resources on federally-owned lands in order to allow for a  comprehensive review  of the federal coal programs.  The terms of this moratorium preclude the BLM from accepting new applications for thermal coal sales or modifying existing leases subject to certain exceptions.  This moratorium could adversely impact members of the coal industry, including our company.  
     
  On July 1, 2016 the U.S. Department of the Interior published the final Consolidated Federal Oil   Gas and Federal   Indian Coal Valuation Reform Rule.  This rule was developed by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue to significantly change the manner in which non-arm s length sales of natural resources from federal lands are valued for royalty purposes by mandating a net-back calculation from the first third-party sale and introducing a default rule that will require substantial judgment.  The new rule eliminates the benchmarks which have been consistently and successfully utilized by the energy industry since the late 1980 s to ensure that the royalty amount paid is based on the value of the coal severed.  We are analyzing the impacts of the new rule on our current operations and future business decisions.  
     
  Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or post letters of credit to secure performance or payment of certain long-term obligations, such as mine closure or reclamation costs.  We currently use self-bonding to secure performance of certain obligations in Wyoming.  Self-bonding allows us to use the strength of our financial position as security rather than obtaining a traditional surety bond.  As of September 30, 2016, we have self-bonded $190 million in the State of Wyoming.  The Land Quality Division of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (the  Wyoming DEQ ) periodically re-evaluates the amount of the security required, our performance, and our eligibility for self-bonding.  There can be no assurance that the Wyoming DEQ will continue to qualify us for self-bonding.  Additionally, in August 2016 the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement ( OSMRE ) issued a Policy Advisory discouraging state regulatory authorities from approving self-bonding arrangements.  The Policy Advisory indicated that the OSMRE would begin more closely reviewing instances in which states accept self-bonds for mining operations.  In the same month, the OSMRE also announced that it was beginning the rulemaking process to strengthen regulations on self-bonding.  To the extent we are unable to maintain our current level of self-bonding due to changes in legislation, regulations, or their interpretation by state agencies, or in our financial condition, we may be required to obtain surety bonds at commercial terms, which could cause our costs to increase and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.  
     
  We are proactively addressing the ongoing regulatory uncertainties regarding self-bonding programs in Wyoming by seeking to voluntarily transition away from self-bonding.  During the second quarter, we submitted applications to the   Wyoming DEQ   to reduce the bonding amount by incorporating recently issued equipment cost guidelines, completed reclamation, updated reclamation plans, and lower fuel price assumptions.  We have since received approval to lower the total bonding requirement by $154 million.  We have also reallocated our surety underwriters to position the portfolio to those that we believe are supportive of the coal industry.   As of September 30, 2016,  we have $448.9 million of reclamation bonds with these underwriters backed by collateral of 15%, or $71.3 million, in the form of letters of credit under our Credit Agreement.  Although we currently expect to be able to achieve our goal of exiting self-bonding by January 2017, the timing

  of its completion is dependent on the State of Wyoming s processing and approval of our applications, and is therefore, uncertain.  
     
   Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS   
     
  EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).  A quantitative reconciliation of historical  Net income (loss)  to Adjusted EBITDA, and EPS (as defined below) to Adjusted EPS is found in the tables below.  
     
  EBITDA represents net income (loss) before: (1) interest income (expense), net, (2) income tax provision, (3) depreciation and depletion, and (4) amortization.  Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for accretion, which represents non-cash increases in asset retirement obligation liabilities resulting from the passage of time, and specifically identified items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations.  For the periods presented herein, the specifically identified items are:    (1) adjustments to exclude non-cash impairment charges, (2) adjustments for derivative financial instruments, excluding fair value mark-to-market gains or losses and including cash amounts received or paid, and (3) adjustments to exclude debt restructuring costs.   We enter into certain derivative financial instruments, such as put options, that require the payment of premiums at contract inception.  The reduction in the premium value over time is reflected in the mark-to-market gains or losses.  Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA does not include premiums paid for derivative financial instruments; either at contract inception, as these payments pertain to future settlement periods, or in the period of contract settlement, as the payment occurred in a preceding period. 
     
  Adjusted EPS represents diluted earnings (loss) per common share ( EPS ) adjusted to exclude (i) the estimated per share impact of the same specifically identified non-core items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA as described above and (ii) the cash and non-cash interest expense associated with the early retirement of debt and refinancing transactions.  All items are adjusted at the statutory tax rate of approximately 37% and exclude the impact of any valuation allowance.  
     
  Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  Moreover, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is different than EBITDA as defined in our debt financing agreements.  We recognize that using Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS as performance measures has inherent limitations as compared to net income (loss), EPS, or other U.S. GAAP financial measures, as these non-GAAP measures exclude certain items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be meaningful to investors.  As a result of the exclusions, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation and do not purport to be alternatives to net income (loss), EPS, or other U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance.  See Part II  Item 6   Selected Financial Data   of our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS and their limitations compared to U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
     
  A quantitative reconciliation for each of the periods presented of  Net income (loss)  to Adjusted EBITDA and EPS to Adjusted EPS is found within this Item 2.

   Owned and Operated Mines Segment   
     
  The following table shows volume and price related changes to coal revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   (in millions):  

Revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to fewer tons sold.  Volumes decreased as a result of lower natural gas prices and higher customer stockpiles.  Realized prices for the three months ended September 30, 2016 also decreased revenue   compared to the same period in    2015 as the domestic coal market continues to be depressed.  
     
   Logistics and Related Activities Segment   
     
  Revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of continued weak international prices for seaborne thermal coal and our suspension of international shipments during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Other   
     
  Revenue for Other includes buyouts of customer coal contracts of $1.6 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  See  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of Part II of this report.  
     
   Cost of Product Sold   
     
  The following table presents  Cost of product sold  (in millions, except per ton amounts and percentages):  

Owned and Operated Mines Segment   
     
  Cost of product sold decreased primarily as a result of fewer tons of coal sold in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, which resulted in lower direct operating costs.  We saw significant decreases in production taxes and royalties, repairs and maintenance, outside services and diesel costs.  Repairs and maintenance decreased as a result of lower equipment hours, condition monitoring, and in-house repairs completed at our rebuild center.  Outside services also decreased as a result of performing more work in-house rather than using contractors.  
     
 45   

Table of Contents   
     
  The average cost per ton sold decreased primarily as a result of the lower direct operating costs.  
     
   Logistics and Related Activities Segment   
     
  Cost of product sold decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to our suspension of international shipments during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   Operating Income (Loss)   
     
  The following table presents  Operating income (loss)  (in millions, except for percentages):  

Owned and Operated Mines Segment   
     
  In addition to the revenue and cost of product sold factors previously discussed, operating income decreased due to a $16.8 million reduction to reclamation asset depreciation seen in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015 related to the decrease in the ARO liability at the Cordero Rojo Mine.  Partially offsetting the increased  Depreciation and depletion  were lower mark-to-market losses of $9.9 million on our derivative financial instruments.  
     
   Logistics and Related Activities Segment   
     
  In addition to the revenue and cost of product sold factors previously discussed, the operating loss decreased due to decreased amortization, partially offset by fewer derivative gains   during the   three months ended   September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015  .  
     
   Other   
     
  The increase to operating loss for Other during the   three months ended   September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to  Debt restructuring  of $4.5 million, partially offset by decreased  Selling, general and administrative expenses  ( SG A ).  
     
   Other Income (Expense)   
     
  The following table presents  Other income (expense)  (in millions, except for percentages):  

46   

Table of Contents   
     
  Other expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 increased primarily as a result of the write-off of $1.3 million in deferred financing costs related to the decrease in the Credit Agreement s borrowing capacity.  
     
   Income Tax Provision   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had deferred tax assets principally arising from: ARO, alternative minimum tax credits, pension and postretirement benefits, contract rights and net operating loss carry-forwards for income tax purposes multiplied by an expected rate of 37%. As management cannot determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset has been established at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate is due primarily   to the   impact of percentage depletion, income tax in the states in which we do business, changes in our valuation allowance and the impact of out of period adjustments.  In addition, our effective tax rate of 66.1% for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016 is materially impacted by   the intraperiod tax allocation required as a result of the adjustments to ARO and the retiree medical plan while incurring a loss for that period.  Our effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was 28.3%.

Table of Contents   
     
   Owned and Operated Mines Segment   
     
  The following table shows volume and price related changes to coal revenue for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   (in millions):  

Revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to fewer tons sold.  Volumes decreased as a result of the mild winter weather, low natural gas prices, and higher customer stockpiles.  Realized prices for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased compared to the same period in 2015 as the domestic coal market continues to be depressed.  
     
   Logistics and Related Activities Segment   
     
  Revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to significantly lower international shipments as a result of continued weak international prices for seaborne thermal coal.  While we had three vessels carry over from 2015 into the first quarter of 2016, there were no international shipments during either the second or third quarters of 2016.  
     
   Other   
     
  Revenue for Other includes buyouts of customer coal contracts of $24.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2015.  See  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of Part II of this report.  
     
   Cost of Product Sold   
     
  The following table presents  Cost of product sold  (in millions, except per ton amounts and percentages):  

51   

Table of Contents   
     
   Owned and Operated Mines Segment   
     
  Cost of product sold decreased primarily as a result of fewer tons of coal sold in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, which resulted in lower direct operating costs.  We saw significant decreases in production taxes and royalties, repairs and maintenance, diesel costs, outside services, and labor.  Repairs and maintenance decreased as a result of lower equipment hours, condition monitoring, and in-house repairs completed at our rebuild center.  Outside services also decreased as a result of performing more work in-house rather than using contractors.  Our production costs increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the fewer tons sold.  Other cost of product sold decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to fewer tons sold.  
     
   Logistics and Related Activities Segment   
     
  Cost of product sold decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a reduction in the volume of Asia tons delivered.  While we had three vessels carry over from 2015 into the first quarter of 2016, there were no international shipments during either the second or third quarters of 2016.  
     
   Operating Income (Loss)   
     
  The following table presents  Operating income (loss)  (in millions, except for percentages):  

*                                       Not meaningful.  
     
   Owned and Operated Mines Segment   
     
  In addition to the revenue and cost of product sold factors previously discussed,   operating income increased due to a $22.2 million reduction to reclamation asset depreciation seen in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 related to a   decrease in the ARO liability at all three mine sites  .  Additionally, the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015 included a goodwill impairment charge of $33.4 million compared to impairments of $2.5 million in the same period in 2016.  Finally, we recognized mark-to-market gains of $5.2 million in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 as compared to losses of $13.0 million for the same period in 2015.  
     
   Logistics and Related Activities Segment   
     
  In addition to the revenue and cost of product sold factors previously discussed, the operating loss decreased due to fewer derivative losses and decreased amortization   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.

   Other   
     
  In addition to the revenue factors previously discussed, the decrease in operating loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015   was partially offset by  Debt restructuring  of $4.5 million, an increase in SG A costs of $1.4 million due to higher stock compensation and bonus accrual expense and  Impairments  of $2.0 million.  
     
   Other Income (Expense)   
     
  The following table presents  Other     income   (expense)    (in millions, except for percentages):  

Other expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 remained similar as lower imputed interest on our federal coal lease obligations was partially offset by increased amortization of deferred financing costs due to the write-off of $1.3 million related to the decrease in the Credit Agreement s borrowing capacity.  
     
   Income Tax Provision   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had deferred tax assets principally arising from: ARO, alternative minimum tax credits, pension and postretirement benefits, contract rights and net operating loss carry-forwards for income tax purposes multiplied by an expected rate of 37%. As management cannot determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset has been established at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  The difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate is due primarily to the impact of percentage depletion, income tax in the states in which we do business, changes in our valuation allowance and the impact of out of period adjustments.  In addition, our effective tax rate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of 66.1% was materially impacted by intraperiod tax allocation required as a result of the adjustments to ARO and the retiree medical plan, while incurring a loss during the period.  
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   

In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, our primary sources of liquidity are cash from our operations and borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) and   Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility ( A/R Securitization Program ).  We also have a capital leasing program for some of our capital equipment purchases.  These programs provide flexibility and liquidity to our capital structure.  
     
  Cash balances depend on a number of factors, such as the volume of coal sold by our Owned and Operated Mines segment; the price for which we sell our coal; the costs of mining, including labor, repairs and maintenance, fuel and explosives; capital expenditures to acquire property, plant and equipment; the volume of deliveries coordinated by our Logistics and Related Activities segment to customer contracted destinations; the revenue we receive for our logistics services; demurrage and any take-or-pay charges; the results of our derivative financial instruments; coal-fired electricity demand, regulatory changes and energy policies impacting our business; and other risks and uncertainties, including those risk factors discussed in Item 1A in our 2015 Form 10-K and in Item 1A of Part II of this report.  Ongoing depressed industry conditions and recent coal producer bankruptcy filings have resulted in increased credit pressures on the coal industry.  Any credit demands by third parties or refusals by banks, surety bond providers, investors or others to extend, renew or refinance credit on commercially reasonable terms may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

Table of Contents   
     
  Capital   expenditures are necessary to keep our equipment fleets updated to maintain our mining productivity and competitive position and to add new equipment as necessary.  Cash payments for c  apital expenditures (excluding capitalized interest) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $30.1 million and $28.1 million, respectively.  Capital expenditures for   the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 include $7.3 million for the dragline move from the Cordero Rojo Mine to the Antelope Mine, which was placed in service in the third quarter of 2016.  Our anticipated capital expenditures are expected to be between $30 million and $40 million in 2016.  
     
    Overview of Cash Transactions    
     
  We started   2016   with $89.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.  After capital expenditures and cash used in our operating activities, we concluded the nine months ended September 30,   2016   with cash and cash equivalents of $90.3 million.  The following table represents cash flows (in millions, except percentages):  

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to decreases in working capital of $22.1 million, primarily due to lower Accounts receivable as a result of reduced sales.  Net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items decreased $7.8 million.  
     
  The decrease in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily related to a $6.5 million payment of restricted cash in 2015, which was used to fund an escrow account associated with our Westshore capacity, and $5.4 million payment in 2015 toward permitting expenses as a partner in Gateway Pacific Terminal.  In addition, we received $2.8 million in 2016 related to an insurance settlement on a flood at our Cordero Rojo Mine in 2014.  These were partially offset by purchases of property, plant and equipment which increased by $2.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  
     
  The decrease in cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015   was primarily due to payments of $64.0 million made on the principal portion of our federal coal lease obligations in 2015, partially offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $3.6 million related to the Exchange Offers (as defined below).  
     
    Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility    
     
  On February 21, 2014, Cloud Peak Energy Resources LLC entered into a five year Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which was amended on September 5, 2014 and September 9, 2016 (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ).  The Credit Agreement provides us with a senior secured revolving credit facility with a capacity of up to $400 million that can be used to borrow funds or obtain letters of credit.  The borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement is reduced by the undrawn face amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding, which may be up to $250 million at any time.  
     
  On September 9, 2016, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the  Second Amendment ).  The Second Amendment primarily replaced the quarterly EBITDA-based financial covenants that previously required us to (a) maintain defined minimum levels of interest coverage and (b) comply with a maximum net secured debt leverage ratio.  These financial covenants were replaced with a new monthly minimum liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain liquidity, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of not less than $125 million as of the last day of each month. The Second Amendment reduced the maximum borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement to $400 million, from the previous maximum capacity of $500 million. It also revised the permitted debt covenant and permitted lien covenant to permit the  
     
 54   

Table of Contents   
     
  issuance of second lien debt in an amount up to $350 million. Additionally, it revised various negative covenants and baskets that would apply to, among other things, the incurrence of debt, making investments, asset dispositions and restricted payments. Lastly, it established a requirement for deposit account control agreements with the administrative agent for certain deposit accounts. The Second Amendment did not change the maturity of the Credit Agreement, which remains February 21, 2019.  
     
  Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin of 3.50%.  We pay the lenders a commitment fee of 0.50% per year on the unused amount of the Credit Agreement.  Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, unless drawn upon, will incur a per annum fee from the date at which they are issued of 3.50%.  Letters of credit that are drawn upon may be converted to loans at our request, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth in the Credit Agreement.  In addition, in connection with the issuance of a letter of credit, we are required to pay the issuing bank a fronting fee of 0.125% per annum.  
     
  The Credit Agreement also contains other non-financial covenants, including covenants related to our ability to incur additional debt or take other corporate actions.  In addition, there are customary events of default with customary grace periods and thresholds under the Credit Agreement.  Our ability to access the available funds under the Credit Agreement may be prohibited in the event that we do not comply with the covenants or if we otherwise default on our obligations under the Credit Agreement.  
     
  Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and substantially all of the assets of certain of our subsidiaries, subject to certain permitted liens and customary exceptions for similar coal financings.  Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are also supported by a guarantee by CPE Inc. and our domestic restricted subsidiaries.  
     
  Under the Credit Agreement, CPE Resources is permitted to make certain distributions to CPE Inc. to enable it to pay federal, state and local income and certain other taxes it incurs that are attributable to the business and operations of CPE Resources and its subsidiaries.  In addition, as long as no default under the Credit Agreement exists, the subsidiaries of CPE Inc. also may make annual distributions to CPE Inc. to fund dividends or repurchases of CPE Inc. s stock and additional distributions in accordance with certain distribution limits in the Credit Agreement.  Finally, the subsidiaries of CPE Inc. may make loans to CPE Inc. subject to certain limitations in the Credit Agreement.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had no borrowings and the undrawn face amount of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement was $71.3 million.  As of December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement.  We were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
     
    A/R Securitization Program    
     
  Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to the A/R Securitization Program.  In January 2013, we formed Cloud Peak Energy Receivables LLC, a special purpose, bankruptcy-remote wholly-owned subsidiary to purchase, subject to certain exclusions, in a true sale, trade receivables generated by certain of our subsidiaries without recourse (other than customary indemnification obligations for breaches of specific representations and warranties), and then transfer undivided interests in up to $75 million of those accounts receivable to a financial institution for cash borrowings for our ultimate benefit.  The total borrowings are limited by eligible accounts receivable, as defined under the terms of the A/R Securitization Program.  The A/R Securitization Program will terminate on January 23, 2018.  As of September 30, 2016, we had $29.5 million of available receivable sale capacity under the A/R Securitization Program.  There were no borrowings outstanding under the A/R Securitization Program as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
     
    Liquidity    
     
   Our aggregate availability for borrowing under the Credit Agreement and the A/R Securitization Program was approximately $358.2 million as of September 30, 2016.   Our total liquidity, which includes cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under both our Credit Agreement and the A/R Securitization Program, was $448.5 million as of September 30, 2016.   
     
 55   

Table of Contents   
     
  We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our primary ordinary course uses of cash for the next twelve months, which include our costs of coal production and logistics services, capital expenditures, and interest on our debt.  
     
  If we do not have sufficient resources from ongoing operations to satisfy our obligations or the timing of payments on our obligations does not coincide with cash inflows from operations, we may need to use our cash on hand or borrow under our line of credit.  If the obligation is in excess of these amounts, we may need to seek additional borrowing sources or take other actions.  Depending upon existing circumstances at the time, we may not be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or at all.  In addition, our existing debt instruments contain restrictive covenants, which may prohibit us from borrowing under our revolving Credit Agreement or pursuing certain alternatives to obtain additional funding.  
     
  We regularly monitor the capital and bank credit markets for opportunities that we believe will improve our balance sheet, and may engage, from time to time, in financing or refinancing transactions as market conditions permit.  Future activities may include, but are not limited to, public or private debt or equity offerings, the purchase of our outstanding debt for cash in open market purchases or privately negotiated refinancing, extension and exchange transactions or public or private exchange offers or tender offers.  Any financing or refinancing transaction may occur on a stand-alone basis or in connection with, or immediately following, other transactions.  Our ability to access the debt or equity capital markets on economic terms in the future will be affected by general economic conditions, the domestic and global financial markets, our operational and financial performance, the value and performance of our debt or equity securities, prevailing commodity prices, and other macroeconomic factors outside of our control.  
     
    2019 Notes and 2024 Notes    
     
  We refer to the senior notes due December 15, 2019 (the  2019 Notes ) and the senior notes due March 15, 2024 (the  2024 Notes ) collectively as the  Senior Notes.   The 2019 Notes and 2024 Notes bear interest at fixed annual rates of 8.50% and 6.375%, respectively.  There are no mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments for the Senior Notes.  Interest payments are due semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 for the 2019 Notes and semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 for the 2024 Notes.  Subject to certain limitations, we may redeem the 2019 Notes by paying specified redemption prices in excess of their principal amount prior to December 15, 2017, or by paying their principal amount thereafter.  We may redeem some or all of the 2024 Notes by paying specified redemption prices in excess of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, prior to March 15, 2022, or by paying their principal amount thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.  
     
  The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by Cloud Peak Energy Inc. and all of our existing and future restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our debt under our Credit Agreement.  Refer to   Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility .  Substantially all of our consolidated subsidiaries, excluding Cloud Peak Energy Receivables LLC, are considered to be restricted subsidiaries and guarantee the Senior Notes.  
     
  The indentures governing the Senior Notes, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred equity; pay dividends or distributions; repurchase equity or repay subordinated indebtedness; make investments or certain other restricted payments; create liens; sell assets; enter into agreements that restrict dividends, distributions, or other payments from restricted subsidiaries; enter into transactions with affiliates; and consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of their assets and the assets of their restricted subsidiaries on a combined basis.  
     
  Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a  change in control  as defined in the indentures, holders of our notes could require us to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.  
     
    Exchange Offers    
     
  On October 17, 2016, our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, CPE Resources and Cloud Peak Energy Finance Corp. (collectively, the  Issuers ) completed offers to exchange (the  Exchange Offers ), up to $400 million aggregate principal amount of their outstanding 2019 and 2014 Notes (collectively, the  Old Notes ), for new secured 12.00% Second Lien Notes due 2021 to be issued by the Issuers (the  New Secured Notes ) and, in some cases, cash consideration, subject to the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offers.  The primary purposes of the Exchange Offers  
     
 56   

Table of Contents   
     
  were to extend the maturity of the 2019 Notes to 2021, to reduce leverage by capturing the trading discounts on the Old Notes and to further our ongoing efforts to provide sufficient liquidity to manage through depressed industry conditions and better position the capital structure to help facilitate a future extension of the Credit Agreement or new bank facility or other line of credit before the Credit Agreement terminates in February 2019.  
     
  Holders of $237.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and $143.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes tendered such notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers.  On October 17, 2016, the Issuers accepted for exchange all such Old Notes validly tendered, issued $290.4 million aggregate principal amount of New Secured Notes and made cash payments of $26.0 million in the aggregate (including $7.7 million in accrued and unpaid interest) to tendering holders of the Old Notes.  The transaction resulted in recognition of $4.5 million in expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Upon completion of the Exchange Offers, $62.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and $56.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes remain outstanding.  
     
  The exchanges of the Old Notes for the New Secured Notes were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring.  As the future cash flows of the New Secured Notes were greater than the carrying amount of the Old Notes, no gain was recognized.  The amount of extinguished debt will be amortized over the remaining life of the New Secured Notes using the effective interest method and recognized as a reduction of interest expense.  As a result, our reported interest expense will be significantly less than the contractual cash interest payments throughout the term of the New Secured Notes.  Our current tax attributes are expected to offset any cash tax impacts from the Exchange Offers.  
     
    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
     
  In the normal course of business, we are party to guarantees and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, performance or surety bonds and indemnities, which are not reflected on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.   These instruments are used to secure certain of our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, secure coal lease obligations, and for other operating requirements.  We are proactively addressing the ongoing regulatory uncertainties regarding self-bonding programs in Wyoming by seeking to voluntarily transition away from self-bonding.  During the second quarter of 2016, we submitted applications to the Wyoming DEQ to reduce the bonding amount by incorporating recently issued equipment cost guidelines, completed reclamation, updated reclamation plans, and lower fuel price assumptions.  We have since received approval to lower the total bonding requirements by $154 million.  This will reduce our self-bonding amount once processed by the State of Wyoming.  We have also reallocated our surety underwriters to position the portfolio to those that we believe are supportive of the coal industry.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we were self-bonded for $190 million and had $448.9 million of reclamation bonds with these underwriters backed by collateral of 15%, or $71.3 million, in the form of letters of credit under our Credit Agreement.  The terms and conditions with the issuers of the surety bonds allow for collateral calls to mitigate their exposure.  The amount of collateral that could be required would be based on the underlying bonded assets and their risks, our credit profile, and overall market conditions.  Should further collateral for these obligations be called, this could utilize a significant portion or our existing liquidity.  Although we currently expect to be able to achieve our goal of exiting self-bonding in January 2017, the timing of its completion is dependent on the State of Wyoming s processing and approval of our applications, and is therefore, uncertain.  
     
   Climate Change Regulatory Environment   
     
  Enactment of current, proposed, or future laws or regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, like the creation of mandatory use requirements for renewable fuel sources, will likely result in electricity generators further switching from coal to other fuel sources.  Public concern and the political environment may also continue to materially and adversely impact future coal demand and usage to generate electricity, regardless of applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  Additionally, the creation and issuance of subsidies designed to encourage use of alternative energy sources could further decrease the demand for coal as an energy source.  The potential financial impact on us as a result of these factors will depend upon the degree to which electricity generators diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source as a result thereof.  That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the appeal and design of the subsidies being offered, the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations such as mandating use by utilities of renewable fuel sources, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of any commercial development and deployment of carbon capture technologies, including storage, conversion, or other commercial use for captured carbon.  In view of the significant  
     
 57   

Table of Contents   
     
  uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, however, such impacts may be significant.  See Item 1  Business Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters Global Climate Change  and Item 1A  Risk Factors  of our 2015 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding how climate change and other environmental regulatory matters may materially adversely impact our business.  
     
   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.  These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements.  Accounting measurements at interim dates inherently involve greater reliance on estimates than at year-end.  The results of operations for the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that can be expected for future quarters or the full year.  Please refer to the section entitled  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  of  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.  
     
   Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  See Note 2   of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1   for a discussion of newly adopted accounting standards and recently issued accounting pronouncements.  
     
   Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.      
     
  We define market risk as the risk of economic loss as a consequence of the adverse movement of market rates and prices or credit standings.  We believe our principal market risks are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk.  
     
   Commodity Price Risk   
     
  Historically, we have principally managed the commodity price risk for our coal contract portfolio through the use of long-term coal supply agreements of varying terms and durations.  Market risk includes the potential for changes in the market value of our coal portfolio, which includes index sales, export pricing, and PRB derivative financial instruments.  As of September 30, 2016, we had committed to sell approximately 61.0 million tons during 2016, of which 61.0 million tons are under fixed-price contracts.  In addition, we entered into certain forward financial contracts linked to Newcastle coal prices to help manage our exposure to variability in future international coal prices.  As of September 30, 2016, we held coal forward contracts for approximately 0.1 million tons which will settle in 2016, of which all have been fixed under offsetting contracts.  
     
   We also face price risk involving other commodities used in our production process, primarily diesel fuel.  Based on our projections of our usage of diesel fuel for the next 12 months, and assuming that the average cost of diesel fuel increases by 10%, we would incur additional fuel costs of approximately $4.4 million over the next 12 months.    In addition, we use WTI derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to diesel fuel prices.  If WTI decreases by 10%, we would incur additional costs of $3.9 million.  The terms of the program are disclosed in Note 5 to our Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.   
     
   Interest Rate Risk   
     
  Our Credit Agreement, certain of our capital leases, and our A/R Securitization Program are subject to an adjustable interest rate.  See Item 2  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources.   We had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement or A/R Securitization Program as of September 30, 2016.  If we borrow funds under the Credit Agreement or A/R Securitization Program, we may be subject to increased sensitivity to interest rate movements.  
     
  The $7.3 million of borrowings under the capital leasing program are also subject to variable interest rates although any change to the rate would not have a significant impact on cash flow.  Any future debt arrangements that we enter into may also have adjustable interest rates that may increase our sensitivity to interest rate movements.

   Credit Risk   
     
  We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by our counterparties, which may include end-use customers, trading houses, brokers, and financial institutions that serve as counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and hold our investments. We attempt to manage this exposure by entering into agreements with counterparties that meet our credit standards and that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. These steps may not always be effective in addressing counterparty credit risk.  
     
  When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated. These steps include obtaining letters of credit and requiring prepayments for shipments. See Item 1A  Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry  We are exposed to counterparty risk with our customers, trading partners, financial institutions, and other parties with whom we conduct business.   in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
     
   Item 4.   Controls and Procedures.      
     
    Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
     
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to senior management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016, and has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
     
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
     
  During the most recent fiscal quarter, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

   OTHER INFORMATION     
     
   Item 1.   Legal Proceedings.      
     
  See Note 10   of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1  , of this report relating to certain legal proceedings, which information is incorporated by reference herein.  
     
   Item 1A.   Risk Factors.      
     
   In addition to the other information set forth in this report, including the risk factors set forth below, you should carefully consider the additional risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A of our   2015    Form 10-K.  The risks described herein and in our   2015   Form 10-K are not the only risks we may face.  If any of those risk factors, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material, actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.  In our judgment, other than as set forth below, there were no material changes in the risk factors as previously disclosed in Item 1A of our   2015   Form 10-K.  
     
    Our Credit Agreement provides an important source of our overall liquidity.  Because the Second Amendment did not change its February 2019 maturity, we will need to extend or replace the Credit Agreement before its maturity and may need to first address our significant obligations coming due in 2019 and thereafter.  If we are unable to successfully extend or replace the Credit Agreement in a timely manner, our future financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.    
     
  On September 9, 2016, CPE Resources entered into the Second Amendment (the  Second Amendment ) to our existing revolving credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ) which, among other things, replaced quarterly EBITDA-based financial covenants that previously required us to (a) maintain defined minimum levels of interest coverage and (b) comply with a maximum net secured debt leverage ratio, with a new monthly minimum liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain liquidity of not less than $125 million as of the last day of each month. The Second Amendment also reduced the maximum borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement to $400 million from the previous maximum capacity of $500 million.  
     
  The Second Amendment, however, did not change the maturity of the Credit Agreement, which remains February 21, 2019.  As a result, we will need to extend or replace the Credit Agreement before its maturity to ensure we maintain sufficient liquidity for our business.  
     
  On October 17, 2016, we completed the Exchange Offers for a substantial portion of the outstanding 2019 Notes and 2024 Notes.  The 2019 Notes not tendered in the Exchange Offers continue to be due at their stated maturity in December 2019, which could negatively impact our ability to extend or replace our Credit Agreement prior to its February 2019 maturity.  
     
  Our ability to timely extend or replace our Credit Agreement in a sufficient amount, for a sufficient term and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, may be adversely impacted by numerous other factors, including, for example, the remaining portion of the 2019 Notes, our ability to address our logistics take-or-pay exposure, our overall financial condition, results and financial projections, the amount and timing of our other obligations and liquidity needs, coal industry conditions in the U.S. and globally, investor sentiment toward the coal industry, the availability of credit and impact of anti-fossil fuel loan and investment restrictions imposed by traditional sources of credit and capital, general debt and capital markets conditions, U.S. and global economic conditions and other factors and circumstances existing at that time.  
     
  If we are unable to successfully extend or replace our Credit Agreement in a timely manner due to any of these or other factors, our future financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.

    As a result of ongoing depressed coal demand and competition from low priced natural gas, we are receiving more requests from customers to renegotiate, defer or cancel committed purchases under existing agreements.  If we are unable to resolve these customer requests on terms that preserve the amount and timing of our forecasted economic value, our anticipated cash flows, results and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted.    
     
  From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of our coal supply agreements to reallocate certain committed volumes into future time periods, reduce or cancel committed volumes or make other adjustments to our coal supply agreements. We address these requests on a case-by-case basis and seek to reach mutually agreed resolutions of these requested modifications as part of managing our long term customer relationships.  As a result of ongoing depressed coal demand and competition from low priced natural gas, we are receiving more requests from customers to renegotiate, defer or cancel committed purchases under existing agreements. We continue to address these requests on a case-by-case basis.  If we are unable to resolve these customer requests on terms that preserve the amount and timing of our forecasted economic value, our anticipated cash flows, results and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted.  
     
    Demand for U.S. thermal coal has declined significantly in recent years and is increasingly subject to fluctuations due to summer cooling demand, winter heating demand, economic growth rates and other factors that impact demand for electricity. This has resulted in a reduction in long term sales, less visibility into future shipment volumes and increased fluctuations in shipments and associated financial results from period to period.    
     
  As a result of regulatory, political and public pressures against using coal to generate electricity, increased competition with low-cost natural gas, increased competition with taxpayer subsidized solar and wind generation and other factors, demand for U.S. thermal coal has declined significantly in recent years, supporting a lower percentage of baseload electricity demand, and is increasingly subject to fluctuations due to summer cooling demand, winter heating demand, economic growth rates and other factors that impact demand for electricity.  This has resulted in a reduction in long term sales of thermal coal, less visibility into future shipment volumes and increased fluctuations in shipments and associated financial results from period to period.  Although we are seeking to adjust our business and cost structure to reflect lower and more variable demand for thermal coal and to address the adverse impact of these changing conditions on our financial performance, our business requires substantial fixed costs and long lead-time investment decisions and we may not be successful in adjusting to these changing conditions.

Exhibit 95.1   
     
   MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE   
     
   Strong Safety Performance   
     
  One of our most important values is ensuring the safety of our employees and contractors by operating in a safe and responsible manner and protecting the environment in which we live and work.  We have extensive safety systems that have been developed over many years.  We continue to focus on developing these systems and the safety leadership skills of our frontline supervisors.  We spend considerable time working in collaboration with our contractors to improve their safety performance while on our sites.  We use external audits to maintain certifications of our Health, Safety and Environment Management System.  A subset of this system is our certification under ISO-14001 and OHSAS-18001 programs, which cover Environment Management Systems and Occupational Health and Safety.  Our mines are also regularly inspected by the Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) and state mine inspectors as part of their normal programs.  
     
  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the all injury frequency rate ( AIFR ) for our three owned and operated mines was 0.11 (calculated internally based on MSHA methodology).  The AIFR is the number of reportable injuries suffered by mine site employees per 200,000 hours worked.  
     
   Federal Mine Safety and Health Act Information   
     
  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ) requires issuers to include in periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) certain information relating to citations or orders for violations of standards under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ).  The following disclosures respond to that legislation and are presented in accordance with the SEC s final rules promulgated under Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act.  
     
  Whenever MSHA believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the operator must abate the alleged violation.  In these situations, MSHA typically proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay.  In evaluating the below information regarding mine safety and health, investors should take into account factors such as: (a) the number of citations and orders will vary depending on the size of a coal mine, (b) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (c) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and during that process are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed.  

The following table sets out safety-related information required by the Dodd-Frank Act for our three operated mines for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (amounts in whole dollars).  The mine data retrieval system maintained by MSHA may show information that is different than what is provided herein.  Any such differences may be attributed to the need to update that information on MSHA s system and/or other factors.  

(1)             Mine Act Section 104(a) citations are for alleged violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal mine safety or health hazard.  
     
  (2)             Mine Act Section 104(b) orders are for alleged failures to totally abate a citation within the period of time specified in the citation.  
     
  (3)             Mine Act Section 104(d) citations and orders are for an alleged unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards.  
     
  (4)             Total number of flagrant violations issued under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act.  
     
  (5)             Mine Act Section 107(a) orders are for alleged conditions or practices that could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated and result in orders of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition.  
     
  (6)             Total dollar value of MSHA assessments proposed during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  *$8,541 in MSHA assessments were proposed during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  This consists of $185 for citations issued during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and $8,356 for citations issued during previous quarters.  
     
  (7)             Total number of mining-related fatalities during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  (8)             Mine Act Section 104(e) written notices are for an alleged pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of a coal mine health or safety hazard, or the potential to have such a pattern.  
     
  (9)             Any pending legal action before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the  Commission ) involving a coal mine owned and operated by us.  The number of legal actions pending as of March 31, 2016 that fall into each of the following categories is as follows:  
     
  (a)  Contests of citations and orders:  0  
     
  (b)  Contests of proposed penalties:  0  

(c)  Complaints for compensation under Section 111 of the Mine Act:  0  
     
  (d)  Complaints of discharge, discrimination or interference under Section 105 of the Mine Act:  0  
     
  (e)  Applications for temporary relief under Section 105(b)(2) of the Mine Act:  0  
     
  (f)  Appeals of judges  decisions or orders to the Commission:  0
