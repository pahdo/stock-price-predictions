  Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. Description of the Business 
  Under Armour, Inc. is a developer, marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. These products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. The Under Armour Connected Fitness   TM    platform powers the world's largest digital health and fitness community. The Company uses this platform to engage its consumers and increase awareness and sales of its products. 

2  . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Under Armour, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the  Company ). Certain information in footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements was condensed or omitted for the interim periods presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal, recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the financial position and results of operations were included. Intercompany balances and transactions were eliminated. The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   is derived from the audited financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ), which should be read in conjunction with these consolidated financial statements. The results for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016   or any other portions thereof. 
  On March 16, 2016, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of the Company s new Class C non-voting common stock, referred to as the Class C stock. The Class C stock was issued through a stock dividend on a one-for-one basis to all existing holders of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock. The shares of Class C stock were distributed on April 7, 2016, to stockholders of record of Class A and Class B common stock as of March 28, 2016. Stockholders' equity and all references to share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this one-for-one stock dividend.  
  On June 3, 2016, the Board of Directors approved the payment of a   $59.0 million   dividend to the holders of the Company's Class C stock in connection with shareholder litigation related to the creation of the Class C stock. The Company's Board of Directors approved the payment of this dividend in the form of additional shares of Class C stock, with cash in lieu of any fractional shares. This dividend was distributed on June 29, 2016, in the form of   1,470,256   shares of Class C stock and   $2.9 million   in cash.    
  On January 5, 2015, the Company acquired   100%   of the outstanding equity of Endomondo ApS ( Endomondo ), a Denmark-based digital connected fitness company. On March 17, 2015, the Company acquired   100%   of the outstanding equity of MyFitnessPal, Inc. ( MFP ), a digital nutrition and connected fitness company. Both companies were acquired to expand the Under Armour Connected Fitness community.  
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. The majority of the Company s accounts receivable is due from large sporting goods retailers. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition and collateral is not required. The Company's largest customer accounted for   20.2%  ,   18.7%   and   20.7%   of accounts receivable as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Company's largest customer accounted for   11.0%   and   12.5%   of net revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , the allowance for doubtful accounts was   $33.6 million  ,   $5.9 million   and   $6.3 million  , respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs 
  The Company charges certain customers shipping and handling fees. These fees are recorded in net revenues. The Company includes the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate the Company s distribution facilities. These costs, included within selling, general and administrative expenses, were   $25.7 million   and   $14.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $65.1 million   and   $40.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company includes outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as a component of cost of goods sold. 
    
  Management Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, which supersedes the most current revenue recognition requirements. This ASU requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.  In 2016, the FASB issued ASUs 2016-08, 2016-10, 2016-11 and 2016-12, which provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASU 2014-09. These ASUs will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 permitted and should be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.   The Company is   currently evaluating this pronouncement to determine the impact of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which amends the existing guidance for leases and will require recognition of operating leases with lease terms of more than twelve months and all financing leases on the balance sheet. For these leases, companies will record assets for the rights and liabilities for the obligations that are created by the leases. This ASU will require disclosures that provide qualitative and quantitative information for the lease assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.   The Company is   currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which effects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The amendments in this ASU cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. This guidance can be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted.   The Company has   not yet selected a transition date and   is   currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
  In November 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning

     Table of Contents  

of an interim or annual reporting period.  This amendment may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented.   The Company   adopted the provisions of this guidance prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015, and did not retrospectively adjust the prior periods.  Had   the Company   adopted this guidance retrospectively,     $60.7 million     would have been reclassified from deferred income taxes-current to deferred income taxes-long term for the     nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   The adoption of this guidance will simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and reduce complexity without decreasing the usefulness of information provided to users of financial statements. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a significant impact on   the Company's   financial position, results of operations and cash flows.     
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which requires costs incurred to issue debt to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.   The Company   adopted the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2016, and reclassified approximately     $2.9 million   and   $3.1 million     from "Other long term assets" to "Long term debt, net of current maturities"   as of    December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  . 

3  . Long Term Debt 
  Credit Facility 
  In January 2016,   the Company   amended   its   credit agreement to increase revolving credit facility commitments from     $800.0 million   to   $1.25 billion  .   This amendment also extended the term of the revolving credit facility and the remaining outstanding term loans under the credit agreement, which as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $192.5 million  , from   May 2019   to   January 2021  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $250.0 million   outstanding under the revolving credit facility. 
  The borrowings under the revolving credit facility have maturities of less than one year. Up to   $50.0 million   of the facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. There were   $1.5 million   of letters of credit outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .    
  The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions, limit   the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to,   among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge   their   assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates.   The Company is   also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, to consolidated interest expense of not less than   3.50   to   1.00   and is   not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be greater than   3.25   to   1.00   ("consolidated leverage ratio"). As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was   in compliance with these ratios. In addition, the credit agreement contains events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, and includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other material indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement.    
  Borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to,   at the Company s option,   either (a) an alternate base rate, or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made ( adjusted LIBOR ), plus in each case an applicable margin. The applicable margin for loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the  Pricing Grid ) based on the consolidated leverage ratio and ranges between   1.00%   to   1.25%     for adjusted LIBOR loans and   0.00%   to   0.25%   for alternate base rate loans. The weighted average interest rate under the outstanding term loans and revolving credit facility borrowings was   1.62%   and   1.58%   during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company pays   a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility and certain fees with respect to letters of credit.   As of   September 30, 2016  ,   the commitment fee was   15.0   basis points. Since inception,   the Company incurred and deferred   $3.9 million   in financing costs in connection with the credit agreement. 
  3.250% Senior Notes 
  In June 2016,   the Company   issued     $600.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.250%   senior unsecured notes due   June 15, 2026   (the  Notes ). The proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 beginning December 15, 2016. Prior to March 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes),   the Company   may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or a  make-whole  amount applicable to such Notes as described in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or

     Table of Contents  

after March 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes),   the Company   may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
  The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants, including limitations that restrict   the Company s   ability and the ability of certain of   its   subsidiaries to create or incur secured indebtedness and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and   the Company s   ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of   its   properties or assets to another person, in each case subject to material exceptions described in the indenture.   The Company incurred and deferred   $5.3 million   in financing costs in connection with the Notes. 
  Other Long Term Debt 
  In December 2012,   the Company entered into a   $50.0 million     recourse loan collateralized by the land, buildings and tenant improvements comprising   the Company's   corporate headquarters. The loan has a     seven     year term and maturity date of     December 2019  .   The loan bears interest at one month LIBOR plus a margin of     1.50%  ,   and allows for prepayment without penalty. The loan includes covenants and events of default substantially consistent with   the Company's   credit agreement discussed above. The loan also requires prior approval of the lender for certain matters related to the property, including transfers of any interest in the property.   As of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , the outstanding balance on the loan was   $42.5 million  ,   $44.0 million   and   $44.5 million  , respectively.   The weighted average interest rate on the loan was     2.00%   and   1.94%   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  Interest expense, net was     $8.2 million   and   $4.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $18.5 million   and   $10.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   Interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, bank fees, capital and built-to-suit lease interest and interest expense under the credit and other long term debt facilities  . 
  The Company monitors   the financial health and stability of   its   lenders under the credit and other long term debt facilities, however during any period of significant instability in the credit markets lenders could be negatively impacted in their ability to perform under these facilities.    

4. Commitments and Contingencies 
   Other than the borrowings and repayments disclosed in Note   3   and changes which occur in the normal course of business, there were no significant changes to the contractual obligations reported in the 2015 Form 10-K as updated in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
  In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items. Generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which the counterparties are grossly negligent, engage in willful misconduct, or act in bad faith. Based on the Company s historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial and intellectual property disputes, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to its business. The Company believes that all current proceedings are routine in nature and incidental to the conduct of its business, and that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

5  . Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The fair value accounting guidance outlines a valuation framework, creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures, and prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 
                 Level 1: 
    Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level 2: 
    Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3: 
    Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value are set forth in the table below: 

Fair values of the financial assets and liabilities listed above are determined using inputs that use as their basis readily observable market data that are actively quoted and are validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services and brokers. The Company purchases marketable securities that are designated as available-for-sale. The foreign currency contracts represent gains and losses on derivative contracts, which is the net difference between the U.S. dollar value to be received or paid at the contracts  settlement date and the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency to be sold or purchased at the current market exchange rate. The interest rate swap contracts represent gains and losses on the derivative contracts, which is the net difference between the fixed interest to be paid and variable interest to be received over the term of the contract based on current market rates. The fair value of the trust owned life insurance ( TOLI ) policies held by the Rabbi Trust is based on the cash-surrender value of the life insurance policies, which are invested primarily in mutual funds and a separately managed fixed income fund. These investments are initially made in the same funds and purchased in substantially the same amounts as the selected investments of participants in the Under Armour, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the  Deferred Compensation Plan ), which represent the underlying liabilities to participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Liabilities under the Deferred Compensation Plan are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of participants  selected investments. 
  The carrying value of the Company's long term debt approximated its fair value as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The fair value of the Company's long term debt was estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments (Level 2 input). 

6. Stock-Based Compensation 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   2.4 million   performance-based restricted stock units and   0.3 million   performance-based options were awarded to certain officers and key employees under the Company's Second Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended. These performance-based restricted stock units and options have weighted average grant date fair values of   $36.16   and   $36.18  , respectively, and have vesting conditions tied to the achievement of certain combined annual operating income targets for 2016 and 2017. Upon the achievement of the targets, one third of the restricted stock units and options will vest each in   February 2018  ,   February 2019   and   February 2020  . If certain lower levels of combined annual operating income for 2016 and 2017 are achieved, fewer or no restricted stock units or options will vest and the remaining restricted stock units and options will be forfeited. The Company deemed the achievement of certain operating income targets for 2016 and 2017 probable during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company assesses the probability of the achievement of the remaining operating income targets at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that any remaining performance targets related to these performance-based restricted stock units and options will be achieved, a cumulative adjustment will be recorded as if ratable stock-based compensation

expense had been recorded since the grant date. Additional stock based compensation of up to   $5.3 million   would have been recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , for these performance-based restricted stock units and options had the achievement of the remaining operating income targets been deemed probable. 

7. Risk Management and Derivatives 
  Foreign Currency Risk Management 
  The Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by its international subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. These gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. From time to time, the Company may elect to enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for its international subsidiaries.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate notional value of the Company's outstanding foreign currency contracts was   $680.4 million  , which was comprised of Canadian Dollar/U.S. Dollar, Euro/U.S. Dollar, Yen/Euro, Mexican Peso/Euro and Pound Sterling/Euro currency pairs with contract maturities ranging from   one   to   fourteen months  . A portion of the Company's foreign currency contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. The Company also enters into foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges. For foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged transaction. The effective portion is generally released to net income after the maturity of the related derivative and is classified in the same manner as the underlying exposure. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company reclassified   $1.0 million   from other comprehensive income to cost of goods sold related to foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges. The fair values of the Company's foreign currency contracts were assets of   $1.6 million  ,   $3.8 million   and   $1.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note   5   for a discussion of the fair value measurements. Included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency contracts: 

Interest Rate Risk Management 
  In order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, the Company enters into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. The nature and amount of the Company's long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. The Company may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. The Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The contracts pay fixed and receive variable rates of interest. The interest rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the effective portion of the changes in their fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation.   Refer to Note   3   for a discussion of long term debt. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the notional value of the Company's outstanding interest rate swap contracts was $  157.5 million  . During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded a   $0.5 million   and   $0.7 million   increase in interest expense, respectively, representing the effective portion of the contract reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded a   $1.6 million   and   $2.1 million   increase in interest expense, respectively, representing the effective portion of the contract reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair values of the interest rate swap contracts were assets of   $4.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , and were included in other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of the interest rate swap

contracts were liabilities of   $1.5 million   and   $3.4 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and were included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.  
  The Company enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. This credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the derivative contracts. However, the Company monitors the credit quality of these financial institutions and considers the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. 

8. Provision for Income Taxes 
  The effective rates for income taxes were   34.3%   and   41.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   lower   than the effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to increased international profitability and a tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions. 

9. Earnings per Share 
  The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share: 

Effects of potentially dilutive securities are presented only in periods in which they are dilutive. Stock options and restricted stock units representing   83.7 thousand   and   47.1 thousand   shares of Class A common stock outstanding for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Stock options and restricted stock units representing   1.1 million   and   47.1 thousand   shares of Class C common stock outstanding for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Stock options and restricted stock units representing   86.9 thousand   and   463.1 thousand   shares of Class A common stock outstanding for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Stock options and restricted stock units representing   444.3 thousand   and   463.1 thousand   shares of Class C common stock outstanding for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

10. Segment Data and Related Information 
  The Company s operating segments are based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ) makes decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. As such, the CODM receives discrete financial information for the Company's principal business by geographic region based on the Company s strategy to become a global brand. These geographic regions include North America; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA  and Asia-Pacific. Each geographic segment operates exclusively in one industry: the development, marketing and distribution of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. The CODM also receives discrete financial information for the Company's Connected Fitness business. Intersegment revenue is generated by Connected Fitness which runs advertising campaigns for the Company's e-commerce business in North America. The Company accounts for this intersegment revenue as if the sales were made to third parties making similar purchases. Due to the insignificance of the Latin America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific operating segments, they continue to be combined into International for disclosure purposes.  
  The net revenues and operating income (loss) associated with the Company's segments are summarized in the following tables. Net revenues represent sales to external customers for each segment. In addition to net revenues, operating income (loss) is a primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of each segment. Corporate service costs are primarily included in North America and have not been allocated to International or Connected Fitness.

11. Related Party Transactions 
  In June 2016, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Sagamore Development Holdings, LLC, an entity controlled by the Company s CEO, to purchase parcels of land to be utilized to expand the Company s corporate headquarters to accommodate its growth needs.  The purchase price for these parcels totaled   $70.3 million  . The Company determined that the purchase price for the land represented the fair market value of the parcels and approximated the cost to the seller to purchase and develop the parcels, including costs related to the termination of a lease encumbering the parcels. 
  In connection with the purchase of these parcels, in September 2016, the parties entered into an agreement pursuant to which the parties will share the burden of any special taxes arising due to infrastructure projects in the surrounding area.  The allocation to the Company is based on the expected benefits to the Company s parcels from these projects. No obligations were owed by either party under this agreement as of September 30, 2016.

Overview 
  We are a leading developer, marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. The brand s fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. Our products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. The Under Armour Connected Fitness platform powers the world's largest digital health and fitness community and our strategy is focused on engaging with these consumers and increasing awareness and sales of our products. We plan to grow this community by developing innovative applications, services and other digital solutions to impact how athletes and fitness-minded individuals train, perform and live.  
  Our net revenues grew to   $4.0 billion   in   2015   from   $1.5 billion   in   2011  . We reported net revenues of   $3.5 billion   for the first nine months of   2016  , which represented a   26%   increase from the first nine months of   2015  . We believe that the growth in our business has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the Under Armour brand in the marketplace. We plan to continue to increase our net revenues over the long term by increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution sales channel, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets and engaging with consumers through our Connected Fitness business. Our direct to consumer sales channel includes our brand and factory house stores and websites. 
  Our primary business operates in four geographic segments: (1) North America, comprising the United States and Canada, (2) EMEA, (3) Asia-Pacific, and (4) Latin America. We also operate our Connected Fitness business as a separate segment. As our international operating segments are currently not material, we combine them and refer to them collectively as International for reporting purposes. Segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by that segment, less the cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative costs that are incurred directly by that segment, as well as an allocation of certain centrally managed costs. Corporate services costs, which are generally included in our North America operating segment, include company-wide administrative costs.  

General 
  Net revenues comprise net sales, license revenues and Connected Fitness revenues. Net sales comprise sales from our primary product categories, which are apparel, footwear and accessories. Our license revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us by our licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on our products. Our Connected Fitness revenues consist of  digital advertising, digital fitness platform licenses and subscriptions from our Connected Fitness business. 
  Cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs, inbound freight and duty costs, outbound freight costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for inventory obsolescence. The fabrics in many of our products are made primarily of petroleum-based synthetic materials. Therefore our product costs, as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs, could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil. In general, as a percentage of net revenues, we expect cost of goods sold associated with our apparel and accessories to be lower than that of our footwear. A limited portion of cost of goods sold is associated with license and Connected Fitness revenues, primarily website hosting costs and other costs related to our Connected Fitness business.  
  We include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold; however, we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold. Outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate our distribution facilities. These costs were   $25.7 million   and   $14.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $65.1 million   and   $40.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to marketing, selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services. We consolidate our selling, general and administrative expenses into two primary categories: marketing and other. The other category is the sum of our selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services categories. Personnel costs are included in these categories based on the employees  function. Personnel costs include salaries, benefits, incentives and stock-based compensation related to our employees. Our marketing costs are an important driver of our growth. Marketing costs consist primarily of commercials, print ads, league, team, player and event sponsorships and depreciation expense specific to our in-store fixture program for our concept shops.  
  Other expense, net   consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses on our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and unrealized and realized gains and losses on adjustments that arise from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries. 

Results of Operations 
  The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues:    

Consolidated Results of Operations 
  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
  Net revenues   increased     $267.5 million  , or   22.2%  , to   $1,471.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $1,204.1 million   during the same period in   2015  .   Net revenues by product category are summarized below:    
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  

The increase in net sales was driven primarily by:    
             
    Apparel unit sales growth and new offerings in multiple lines led by training and golf; and  
                
    Footwear unit sales growth, led by running, basketball and training.    
     License revenues     increased     $5.2 million  , or   21.3%  , to   $29.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $24.3 million   during the same period in   2015   driven primarily by increased revenue from our licensing partners in North America.     
  Connected Fitness   revenue   increased     $5.8 million  , or   39.8%  , to   $20.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $14.4 million   during the same period in   2015   primarily driven by increased advertising and subscribers on our fitness applications and higher sales of our licensed products.      
  Gross profit     increased     $111.4 million   to   $698.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from $  587.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin,   decreased     130   basis points to   47.5%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   48.8%   during the same period in     2015  . The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following:    
             
    approximate 80 basis point decrease driven by increased liquidation as a result of our inventory management strategy which we expect to continue for the remainder of the year on a more limited basis; 
                
    approximate 30 basis point decrease related to product margins driven by higher discounts and promotions, partially offset by continued improvement in product input costs, which we do not expect to continue for the remainder of the year; and 
                
    approximate 30 basis point decrease driven by foreign exchange rates, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year on a more limited basis. 
     Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased     $83.5 million   to   $  499.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $415.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to   34.0%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   34.6%   for the same period in   2015  .  These changes were primarily attributable to the following:    
             
    Marketing costs   increased     $11.0 million   to   $139.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   $128.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . This increase was primarily due to key North American retail marketing campaigns, our investments in sponsorships and increased marketing in connection with the growth of our international business. As a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs   decreased   to     9.5%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   10.7%   for the same period in     2015  .     
                
    Other costs   increased     $72.5 million   to   $359.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from     $287.3 million     for the same period in   2015  . The increase was driven by higher personnel and other costs incurred for both the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel, including increased costs related to retail stores, distribution facilities, and our e-commerce business, and strategic initiatives such as product creation, innovation and sport category management. As a percentage of net revenues, other costs     increased   to   24.4%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   23.9%   for the same period in   2015  .  
     Income from operations     increased     $27.9 million  , or   16.3%  , to $  199.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from $  171.4 million   for the same period in   2015  . Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to   13.5%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from   14.2%   for the same period in   2015  .

Interest expense, net     increased     $4.1 million   to $  8.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from $  4.1 million   for the same period in   2015  . This increase was primarily due to interest on the net increase of   $172.2   million in total debt outstanding. 
  Other expense, net     decreased     $2.4 million   to expense of   $0.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from expense of   $3.2 million   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease was due to higher net gains on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and our derivative financial instruments as compared to the prior period. 
  Provision for income taxes   decreased     $1.5 million   to $  62.1 million   during the   three months ended September 30, 2016     from $  63.6 million   during the same period in   2015  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , our effective tax rate was     32.6%   compared to   38.8%   for the same period in   2015  . The effective rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was lower than the effective tax rate for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to increased international profitability and a tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions. 
  Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  Net revenues   increased     $727.5 million  , or   26.0%  , to   $3,520.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $2,792.6 million   during the same period in   2015  . Net revenues by product category are summarized below:    

The increase in net sales was driven primarily by:     
             
    Apparel unit sales growth and new offerings in multiple lines led by training, golf and running; and

     License revenues     increased     $10.5 million  , or   17.8%  , to   $69.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $59.4 million   during the same period in   2015  , driven primarily by increased revenue from our licensing partners in North America.   
  Connected Fitness   revenue   increased     $25.8 million  , or   70.7%  , to   $62.2 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $36.4 million   during the same period in   2015  , primarily driven by a full nine months of operations from our 2015 acquisitions, increased advertising and subscribers on our fitness applications and higher sales of our licensed products.   
  Gross profit   increased     $313.0 million   to   $1,656.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $1,343.9 million   for the same period in   2015  . Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin,   decreased     100   basis points to   47.1%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   48.1%   for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following: 
             
    approximate 60 basis points decrease driven by increased liquidation as a result of our changing inventory management strategy which we expect to continue the remainder of the year on a more limited basis;  
                
    approximate 50 basis point decrease driven by negative sales mix primarily driven by the continued strength of our accelerated footwear and international growth, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year on a more limited basis; and 
                
    approximate 30 basis point decrease driven by foreign exchange rates, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year on a more limited basis. 
     The decreases above were partially offset by:

As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to   39.9%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   39.8%   for the same period in   2015  . These changes were primarily attributable to the following:  
             
    Marketing costs   increased     $44.3 million   to   $369.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $325.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . This increase was primarily due to key North American retail marketing campaigns, our investments in sponsorships and increased marketing in connection with the growth of our international business. As a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs   decreased   to   10.5%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   11.7%   for the same period in   2015  . 
                
    Other costs   increased     $246.1 million   to   $1,033.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $787.4 million   for the same period in   2015  . This increase was primarily due to $24.5 million in expenses related to the liquidation of The Sports Authority, comprised of $22.7 million in bad debt expense and $1.8 million of in-store fixture impairment. In addition, this increase was driven by higher personnel and other costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel, including increased investment for our factory house and brand house stores. As a percentage of net revenues, other costs   increased   to   29.4%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   28.2%   for the same period in   2015  . 
     Income from operations     increased     $22.6 million  , or   9.8%  , to   $253.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $231.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to   7.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   8.3%   for the same period in   2015  . 
  Interest expense, net     increased     $7.9 million   to   $18.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $10.6 million   for the same period in   2015  . This increase was primarily due to interest on the net increase of   $172.2   million in total debt outstanding.  
  Other expense, net     decreased     $4.0 million   to   $1.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $5.0 million   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease was due to higher net gains on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and our derivative financial instruments as compared to the prior period.  
  Provision for income taxes   decreased     $8.1 million   to   $80.3 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $88.4 million   during the same period in   2015  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our effective tax rate was   34.3%   compared to   41.0%   for the same period in   2015  . The effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was lower than the effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   primarily due to increased international profitability and a tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions. 
  Segment Results of Operations 
  The net revenues and operating income (loss) associated with our segments are summarized in the following tables.

million in expenses related to the liquidation of The Sports Authority, comprised of $22.7 million in bad debt expense and $1.8 million of in-store fixture impairment. In addition, this decrease reflects the movement of $9.1 million in expenses resulting from a strategic shift in headcount supporting our global business from our Connected Fitness operating segment to North America. This decrease is partially offset by the increases in revenue discussed above. Operating income in International   increased     $28.9 million   to   $35.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $6.1 million   for the same period in   2015   primarily due to sales growth in our Asia-Pacific and EMEA operating segments. Operating loss in our Connected Fitness segment   decreased     $15.2 million   to   $32.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $47.7 million   for the same period in   2015   primarily due to increased advertising, subscription and licensing revenue, a full nine months of operations from our 2015 acquisitions and the $9.1 million shift in expenses disclosed above. 

Seasonality 
  Historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher priced cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. The level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. 
    
  Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity 
  Our cash requirements have principally been for working capital and capital expenditures. We fund our working capital, primarily inventory, and capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowings available under our credit and long term debt facilities. Our working capital requirements generally reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize the majority of our net revenues in the last two quarters of the year. Our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture and branded concept shop program, improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth, leasehold improvements to our brand and factory house stores, and investment and improvements in information technology systems. 
  Our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. These systems and processes are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. In addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. 
  We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, our ability to access the debt capital markets and borrowings available to us under our credit agreement and other financing instruments are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1.0 billion   of remaining availability under our revolving credit facility. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, an economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity. In addition, instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
    
  Cash Flows 
  The following table presents the major components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented: 

21 

     Table of Contents  

Operating Activities 
  Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, losses on disposals of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and changes in reserves and allowances. In addition, operating cash flows include the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally inventories, accounts receivable, income taxes payable and receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
  Cash used in operating activities   decreased     $219.2 million   to   $94.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $313.4 million   during the same period in   2015  . The decrease in cash used in operating activities was due to a decrease in net cash outflows from operating assets and liabilities of   $185.4 million   and an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items. The decrease in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by: 
             
    a smaller increase in inventory of   $171.4 million   in the current period compared to the prior period, primarily due to earlier purchases in the prior period for our peak season; partially offset by 
                
    a larger increase in accounts receivable of   $53.7 million   in the current period compared to the prior period, due to the timing of shipments driven by current period sales being more heavily weighted to the end of the period. 
     Investing Activities 
  Cash used in investing activities   decreased     $464.8 million   to   $316.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $780.8 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to our acquisitions of MyFitnessPal and Endomondo during the first quarter of 2015. 
  Capital expenditures for the full year   2016   are expected to be approximately   $450 million  , comprised primarily of investments in our global offices around the world including our headquarters in Baltimore, our distribution centers, our SAP platform, and global Direct-to-Consumer. 
  Financing Activities 
  Cash provided by financing activities   decreased     $207.4 million   to   $460.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $667.8 million   for the same period in   2015  . This decrease was primarily due to higher repayments on our revolving credit facility in the current period compared to the prior period, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes in the current period. 

Capital Resources 
    
  Credit Facility 
  In January 2016,   we   amended   our   credit agreement to increase revolving credit facility commitments from     $800.0 million   to   $1.25 billion  .   This amendment also extended the term of the revolving credit facility and the remaining outstanding term loans under the credit agreement, which as of      September 30, 2016   totaled   $192.5 million  , from   May 2019   to January 2021. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $250.0 million   outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  
  The borrowings under the revolving credit facility have maturities of less than one year. Up to   $50.0 million   of the facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. There were   $1.5 million   of letters of credit outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions, limit   our ability to,   among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge   our   assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates.   We are   also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, to consolidated interest expense of not less than   3.50   to   1.00   and we are   not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be greater than   3.25   to   1.00   ("consolidated leverage ratio"). As of   September 30, 2016  , we were   in compliance with these ratios. In addition, the credit agreement contains events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, and includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other material indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. 
  
   22 

     Table of Contents  

Borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to,   at our option,   either (a) an alternate base rate, or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made ( adjusted LIBOR ), plus in each case an applicable margin. The applicable margin for loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the  Pricing Grid ) based on the consolidated leverage ratio and ranges between      1.00%   to   1.25%     for adjusted LIBOR loans and   0.00%   to   0.25%   for alternate base rate loans. The weighted average interest rate under the outstanding term loans and revolving credit facility borrowings was   1.62%   and   1.58%   during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. We pay   a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility and certain fees with respect to letters of credit.   As of   September 30, 2016  ,   the commitment fee was   15.0   basis points. 

3.250% Senior Notes 
  In June 2016,   we   issued     $600.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.250%   senior unsecured notes due   June 15, 2026   (the  Notes ). The proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 beginning December 15, 2016. Prior to March 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes),   we   may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or a  make-whole  amount applicable to such Notes as described in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after March 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes),   we   may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.    
    The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants, including limitations that restrict   our   ability and the ability of certain of   our   subsidiaries to create or incur secured indebtedness and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and   our   ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of   our   properties or assets to another person, in each case subject to material exceptions described in the indenture. 

Other Long Term Debt 
  In December 2012,   we entered into a   $50.0 million     recourse loan collateralized by the land, buildings and tenant improvements comprising   our   corporate headquarters. The loan has a     seven     year term and maturity date of     December 2019  .   The loan bears interest at one month LIBOR plus a margin of     1.50%  ,   and allows for prepayment without penalty. The loan includes covenants and events of default substantially consistent with   our   credit agreement discussed above. The loan also requires prior approval of the lender for certain matters related to the property, including transfers of any interest in the property.   As of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , the outstanding balance on the loan was   $42.5 million  ,   $44.0 million   and   $44.5 million  , respectively.   The weighted average interest rate on the loan was     2.00%   and   1.94%   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  Interest expense, net was     $8.2 million   and   $4.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $18.5 million   and   $10.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   Interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, bank fees, capital and built-to-suit lease interest and interest expense under the credit and other long term debt facilities  . 
  We monitor   the financial health and stability of   our   lenders under the credit and other long term debt facilities, however during any period of significant instability in the credit markets lenders could be negatively impacted in their ability to perform under these facilities.

Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
  Other than the borrowings and repayments disclosed above in the "Capital Resources" section and changes which occur in the normal course of business, there were no significant changes to the contractual obligations reported in our 2015 Form 10-K as updated in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. We believe the following addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results. 
  Our significant accounting policies are described in Note   2   of the audited consolidated financial statements included in our   2015   Form 10-K. The SEC suggests companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. The SEC considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, see the  Critical Accounting Policies  section of the MD A in our   2015   Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

  There have been no significant changes to our market risk since December 31, 2015. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

  Changes in Internal Controls 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
