The Company acts for clients located throughout the world from its offices located in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and Brazil. 
  The Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries provide advisory services in various jurisdictions.  Our most significant operating entities include: Greenhill   Co., LLC ( G Co ), Greenhill   Co. International LLP ( GCI ), Greenhill   Co. Australia Pty Limited ( Greenhill Australia ) and Greenhill Cogent, LP ("Greenhill Cogent").

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Financial Information 
  These condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), which require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and these footnotes, including investment valuations, compensation accruals and other matters.  Management believes that the estimates used in preparing its condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year information to conform to current year presentation. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include all consolidated accounts of Greenhill   Co., Inc. and all other entities in which the Company has a controlling interest after eliminations of all significant inter-company accounts and transactions.  In accordance with the accounting pronouncements related to consolidation of variable interest entities, the Company consolidates the general partners of certain merchant banking funds in which it has control.  The general partners account for their investments in these merchant banking funds under the equity method of accounting.  As such, the general partners record their proportionate shares of income (loss) from the underlying merchant banking funds.  As the merchant banking funds follow investment company accounting, and generally record all their assets and liabilities at fair value, the general partners  investment in these merchant banking funds represents estimations of fair value.  The Company does not consolidate the merchant banking funds since the Company, through its general partner and limited partner interests, does not have control as the limited partners have certain rights to remove the general partner by a simple majority vote of unaffiliated third-party investors. 
  These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.  The condensed consolidated financial information as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements not included herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year.  
  Revenue Recognition 
  Advisory Revenues 
  It is the Company's accounting policy to recognize revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client, (ii) the agreed-upon services have been completed and delivered to the client or the transaction or events noted in the  
  
   9 

engagement letter are determined to be substantially complete, (iii) fees are fixed and determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. 
  The Company recognizes advisory fee revenues for mergers and acquisitions or financing advisory and restructuring engagements when the services related to the underlying transactions are completed in accordance with the terms of the engagement letter and all other requirements for revenue recognition are satisfied. 
  The Company recognizes capital advisory fees from primary capital raising transactions at the time of the client's acceptance of capital or capital commitments to a fund in accordance with the terms of the engagement letter.  Generally, fee revenue is determined based upon a fixed percentage of capital committed to the fund.  For multiple closings, revenue is recognized at each interim closing based on the amount of capital committed at each closing at the fixed fee percentage.  At the final closing, revenue is recognized at the fixed percentage for the amount of capital committed since the last interim closing. 
  The Company recognizes capital advisory fees from secondary market transactions at the time the sale or transfer of the capital interest is completed in accordance with the terms of the engagement letter.  Generally, fee revenue is determined based upon a fixed percentage of the transaction value.  
  While the majority of the Company's fee revenue is earned at the conclusion of a transaction or closing of a fund, on-going retainer fees, substantially all of which relate to non-success based strategic advisory and financing advisory and restructuring assignments, are also earned and recognized as advisory fee revenue over the period in which the related service is rendered. 
  The Company s clients reimburse certain expenses incurred by the Company in the conduct of advisory engagements. Expenses are reported net of such client reimbursements. Client reimbursements totaled   $1.4 million   and   $0.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4.6 million   and   $4.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Investment Revenues 
  Investment revenues consist of gains (or losses) on the Company's investments in certain merchant banking funds and interest income.  The Company recognizes revenue on its investments in merchant banking funds based on its allocable share of realized and unrealized gains (or losses) reported by such funds.  
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company s cash and cash equivalents consist of (i) cash held on deposit with financial institutions, (ii) cash equivalents and (iii) restricted cash.  The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds and overnight deposits.  
  Management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held.  See "Note 4   Cash and Cash Equivalents". 
  Advisory Fees Receivables 
  Receivables are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is derived by the Company by utilizing past client transaction history and an assessment of the client s creditworthiness. The Company did not record a bad debt expense for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  . For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recorded bad debt expense of   $0.4 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively. 
  Included in the advisory fees receivable balance at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $30.7 million   and   $32.4 million  , respectively, of long term receivables related to primary capital advisory engagements which are generally paid in installments over a period of   three years  .   
  Included as a component of investment revenues on the condensed consolidated statements of income is interest income related to primary capital advisory engagements  of    $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million    for the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $0.6 million   for each of the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Credit risk related to advisory fees receivable is disbursed across a large number of clients located in various geographic areas.  The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals and monitoring procedures but does not require collateral to support accounts receivable. 
  
   10 

Investments 
  The Company's investments in merchant banking funds are recorded under the equity method of accounting based upon the Company's proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the underlying merchant banking fund's net assets.  The value of merchant banking fund investments in privately held companies is determined by management of the fund after giving consideration to the cost of the security, the pricing of other sales of securities by the portfolio company, the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company, purchase multiples paid in other comparable third-party transactions, the original purchase price multiple, market conditions, liquidity, operating results and other qualitative and quantitative factors.  Discounts may be applied to the funds' privately held investments to reflect the lack of liquidity and other transfer restrictions. Investments in publicly traded securities are valued using quoted market prices discounted for any legal or contractual restrictions on sale.  Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations as well as the discounts applied, the estimated fair values of investments in privately held companies may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed.  The values at which the Company's investments are carried on its condensed consolidated statements of financial condition are adjusted to estimated fair value at the end of each quarter and the volatility in general economic conditions, stock markets and commodity prices may result in significant changes in the estimated fair value of the investments from period to period.  
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill is the cost in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets at acquisition date.  The Company tests its goodwill for impairment at least annually.  An impairment loss is triggered if the estimated fair value of an operating unit is less than estimated net book value. Such loss is calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and its carrying value.   
  Goodwill is translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of the periods presented in accordance with the accounting guidance for foreign currency translation. Any translation gain or loss is included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, which is included as a component of other comprehensive income in the condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity.  
  Restricted Stock Units 
  The Company accounts for its share-based compensation payments by recording the fair value of restricted stock units granted to employees as compensation expense.  The restricted stock units are generally amortized over a   five   year service period following the date of grant.  Compensation expense is determined based upon the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the date of grant.  As the Company expenses the awards, the restricted stock units recognized are recorded within equity.  The restricted stock units are reclassified into common stock and additional paid-in capital upon vesting.  The Company records as treasury stock the repurchase of stock delivered to its employees in settlement of tax liabilities incurred upon the vesting of restricted stock units.  The Company records dividend equivalent payments on outstanding restricted stock units as a dividend payment and a charge to equity. 
  Earnings per Share 
  The Company calculates basic earnings per share ( EPS ) by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the sum of (i) the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period and (ii) the weighted average number of shares deemed issuable due to the vesting of restricted stock units for accounting purposes.  See "Note 9   Equity". 
  The Company calculates diluted EPS by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the sum of (i) basic shares per above and (ii) the dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable pursuant to restricted stock units for which future service is required.  Under the treasury method, the number of shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock units included in the calculation of diluted EPS is the excess, if any, of the number of shares expected to be issued, less the number of shares that could be purchased by the Company with the proceeds to be received upon settlement at the average market closing price during the reporting period.  See "Note 10  Earnings per Share". 
  Provision for Taxes 
  The Company accounts for taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance for income taxes which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities. 
  The Company follows the guidance for income taxes in recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in its financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on its income tax returns.  Income tax expense is based on pre-tax accounting income, including adjustments made for the recognition or derecognition related to uncertain tax positions.  The recognition or derecognition of income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions is determined under the guidance, and the Company's policy is to treat interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of pre-tax income. 
  
   11 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period of change.  Management applies the  more-likely-than-not criteria  when determining tax benefits. 
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates of exchange prevailing at the end of the periods presented in accordance with the accounting guidance for foreign currency translation.  Income and expenses transacted in foreign currency have been translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period.  Translation gains and losses are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, which is included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
  Financial Instruments and Fair Value 
  The Company accounts for financial instruments measured at fair value in accordance with accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures which establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the pronouncement are described below: 
  Basis of Fair Value Measurement 
  Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 
  Level 2   Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and 
  Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
  A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performs an analysis of the assets and liabilities that are subject to these disclosures.  At each reporting period, all assets and liabilities for which the fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs or instruments which trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency are classified as Level 3.  Transfers between levels are recognized as of the end of the period in which they occur.  See "Note 6   Fair Value of Financial Instruments". 
  Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 
  The Company believes that the carrying values of all other financial instruments presented in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition approximate their fair value generally due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk.  These fair value measurements would be categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  
  Noncontrolling Interests 
  The Company records the noncontrolling interests of other consolidated entities as equity in the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition. 
  The portion of the consolidated interests in the general partners of certain of the merchant banking funds not held by the Company is presented as noncontrolling interest in equity.  See "Note 5   Investments in Merchant Banking Funds". 
  Property and Equipment 
  Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the life of the assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease.    Estimated useful lives of the Company s fixed assets are generally as follows: 
  Aircraft     7   years 
  
   12 

Equipment     5   years 
  Furniture and fixtures     7   years 
  Leasehold improvements   the lesser of   10   years or the remaining lease term 
  Business Information 
  The Company's activities as an investment banking firm constitute a single business segment, with substantially all revenues generated from advisory services, which includes engagements relating to mergers and acquisitions, financing advisory and restructuring, and capital advisory services.  The Company generates approximately   0%   -   1%   of its revenues from its remaining principal investments in merchant banking funds, which it began liquidating several years ago, and interest income.  
  Accounting Developments 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 amends the guidance in former ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation.  The standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and the Company will adopt these amendments effective on January 1, 2017.  The impact of ASU No. 2016-09 will result in an increase or a decrease to the provision for income taxes for the net tax (cost) from the delivery of restricted stock units, which under the current standard is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings, and could be material to the results of operations and the classifications of cash flows in future periods depending upon, among other things, the level of earnings and stock price of the Company. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 amends the guidance in former ASC 840, Leases.  Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  The standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and the Company will adopt these amendments effective on January 1, 2019. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASC 606, Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends the guidance in former ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of ASC 606 on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  The guidance originally was scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.   In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance which defers the effective date of the new recognition standard by one year.  The standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and the Company will adopt these amendments effective on January 1, 2018 (which will be retroactively applied to the period beginning January 1, 2016). 

Note 3   Acquisition 
  On April 1, 2015, the Company acquired   100%   ownership of Cogent Partners, LP and affiliates ("Cogent", now known as Greenhill Cogent) (the "Acquisition").  The Acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations for Greenhill Cogent have been included in the condensed consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition.  
  The total purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of April 1, 2015.  The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.  The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired, which consisted of Cogent's backlog of client assignments that existed at the time of the closing of the Acquisition, customer relationships, and trade name, has been included in other assets, net of amortization, on the condensed consolidated statement of financial condition.  The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful life of each asset over periods ranging between   one   to   three   years.  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded amortization expense of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, in respect of these assets. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded amortization expense of   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, in respect of these assets. 
  In connection with the Acquisition, the Company agreed to pay to the sellers in the future   $18.9 million   in cash and   334,048   shares of Greenhill common stock if certain agreed revenue targets are achieved (the "Earnout").  The payment for the Earnout will be made if Greenhill Cogent achieves a revenue target during either the   two   year period ending on the   second   anniversary of the closing or the   two   year period ending on the   fourth   anniversary of the closing.  If the revenue target is achieved, the contingent consideration will be paid on the   second   or   fourth   anniversary date of the closing, as applicable.  If the revenue target is achieved during both Earnout periods, only one payment will be made at the end of the first Earnout period.  If the revenue target is not achieved during either of the two year Earnout periods, a payment will not be made.  The fair value of the contingent cash consideration was valued on the date of the Acquisition at   $13.1 million   and is remeasured quarterly based on a probability weighted present value discount that the revenue target may be achieved.  Based on changes in the estimated probability of  
  
   13 

achievement and present value of the remaining term, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   there was   no   change in the value of the contingent consideration and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   the fair value of the contingent consideration increased by   $1.4 million  .  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the fair value of the contingent consideration increased by   $0.1 million   based on changes in the estimated probability of achievement and present value of the remaining term. See "Note 6   Fair Value of Financial Instruments". 
  Set forth below are the Company's summary unaudited pro forma results of operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , which includes the historical results of the Company and Cogent and gives effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015.  These pro forma results include the actual results of Cogent from January 1, 2015 through March 31, 2015.  For the period April 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, Cogent's results were included in the consolidated results of the Company.  

The unaudited pro forma results of operations do not purport to represent what the Company's results of operations would actually have been had the Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015, or to project the Company's results of operations for any future period.  Actual future results may vary considerably based on a variety of factors beyond the Company's control. 
  The pro forma results include (i) compensation and benefits expense based upon a ratio of compensation to total revenues of   54%  , which was the actual compensation ratio used by the Company in the pro forma period presented, (ii) the amortization of identifiable intangible assets of Cogent, (iii) the estimated interest expense related to the bank term loan borrowings used to fund the Acquisition, (iv) the elimination of non-recurring revenue and expense items of Cogent which were directly attributable to the Acquisition, and (v) the estimated income tax expense related to Cogent's historical earnings, which as a result of the Acquisition, will be subject to income tax at the effective tax rate of the Company.  

Note 4   Cash and Cash Equivalents  
    
  The carrying values of the Company's cash and cash equivalents are as follows: 

The carrying value of the Company's cash equivalents approximates fair value. Cash restricted for the payout of Greenhill Australia's deferred compensation plan was distributed over a   7   year period, which ended in March 2016.  A deferred compensation liability relating to the plan of   $0.1 million   as of   December 31, 2015   has been recorded on the condensed consolidated statements of financial condition as a component of compensation payable.  
  Letters of credit are secured by cash held on deposit.

Note 6   Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  There were no Level 1 or Level 2 assets or liabilities measured in the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  There were no Level 3 assets measured at fair value during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  The following table sets forth the measurement at fair value on a recurring basis of the contingent cash consideration due the selling unitholders of Cogent related to the Earnout. The liability arose as a result of the Acquisition on April 1, 2015 and is categorized as a Level 3 liability, which is remeasured each quarterly period based on the probability of achieving the target revenue threshold and weighted average discount rate as discussed below.  See "Note 3   Acquisition".

_____________________________________________ 
  (a) The Company's estimate of contingent consideration as of   September 30, 2016   was principally based on the acquired business' actual and projected revenue generation for the periods from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2017 and April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2019. 
  Valuation Processes - Level 3 Measurements -   The Company utilizes a valuation technique based on a present value method applied to the probability of achieving a range of potential revenue outcomes. The valuation was conducted by the Company.  The Company updates unobservable inputs each reporting period and has a formal process in place to review changes in fair value.   
  
   17 

Sensitivity Analysis - Level 3 Measurements -   The significant unobservable inputs used in determining fair value are the discount rate and forecast revenue information.  Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate would have resulted in a lower (higher) fair value measurement.  Significant increases (decreases) in the forecast revenue information would result in a higher (lower) fair value measurement.  For all significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 liabilities, a change in one of the inputs would not necessarily result in a directionally similar change in the other. 

Note 7   Related Parties 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had no amounts receivable or payable to related parties.  
  The Company subleases airplane and office space to a firm owned by the Chairman of the Company.  The Company recognized rent reimbursements of   $0.02 million   for each of the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $0.05 million   for each of the nine month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which are included as a reduction of occupancy and equipment rental on the condensed consolidated statements of income.  

Note 8   Bank Loan Facilities 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a   $70.0 million   revolving bank loan facility with a U.S. banking institution to provide for working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes.  In March 2016, the borrowing capacity under the revolving loan facility was increased by   $20.0 million  , from   $50.0 million   to   $70.0 million  , and the maturity date was extended to   April 30, 2017  . Interest on the borrowings is based on the higher of   3.50%   or the U.S. Prime Rate and is payable monthly.  The weighted average daily borrowings outstanding under the revolving bank loan facility were approximately   $52.2 million   and   $34.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The weighted average interest rate was   3.50%   and   3.25%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  In connection with the acquisition of Cogent in April 2015, the Company borrowed   $45.0 million  , which was comprised of   two   bank term loan facilities (the "Term Loan Facilities"), each in an original principal amount of   $22.5 million  . One Term Loan Facility was payable in full on   April 30, 2016   (the "  One   Year Facility") and bore interest at the Prime Rate plus three-quarters of one percent (  0.75%  ) per annum. In April 2016, the One Year Facility was repaid in full. The other Term Loan Facility matures on   April 30, 2018   (the "  Three   Year Facility"), is payable in   four   equal semi-annual installments beginning on   October 31, 2016   and bears interest at the Prime Rate plus one and one-quarter percent (  1.25%  ) per annum, which interest rate will be reduced to the Prime Rate plus three-quarters of one percent (  0.75%  ) per annum when the amount outstanding on the Three Year Facility is   $7.5 million   or less.  The first installment of   $5.6 million   of the Three Year Facility was repaid in August 2016 and at   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding principal balance of the Three Year Facility was   $16.9 million  . Future installments on the Three Year Facility are due on April 30, 2017 and October 31, 2017 and the final installment is due on April 30, 2018.  There are no prepayment penalties for the early repayment of either Term Loan Facility.  Principal amounts repaid on the Term Loan Facilities cannot be reborrowed. The interest rate applicable to the Term Loan Facilities can never be less than four percent (  4.00%  ) per annum. The weighted average interest rate related to the Term Loan Facilities was   4.67%   and   4.33%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   The revolving and term loan facilities are provided by a U.S. banking institution and are secured by any cash distributed in respect of the Company s investment in the U.S. based merchant banking funds and cash distributions from G Co and GCI.  In addition, the bank loan facilities have a prohibition on the incurrence of additional indebtedness without the prior approval of the lenders and the Company is required to comply with certain financial and liquidity covenants. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was compliant with all loan covenants. 

Note 9   Equity 
  On September 21, 2016, a dividend of   $0.45   per share was paid to stockholders of record on September 7, 2016.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , dividend payments of   $1.35   per share were paid to stockholders. Dividends include dividend equivalents of   $6.4 million   and   $5.1 million  , which were payable on outstanding restricted stock units for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   850,367   restricted stock units vested and were issued as common stock of which the Company is deemed to have repurchased   319,194   shares at an average price of   $25.10   per share in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities in respect of stock delivered to its employees in settlement of restricted stock units. In addition, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased in open market transactions   626,455   shares of its common stock at an average price of   $20.22   per share. 
  
   18 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   823,639   restricted stock units vested and were issued as common stock of which the Company is deemed to have repurchased   340,112   shares at an average price of   $34.91   per share in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities in respect of stock delivered to its employees in settlement of restricted stock units. 

Note 10   Earnings per Share 
  The computations of basic and diluted EPS are set forth below: 

The weighted number of shares and dilutive potential shares do not include   334,048   shares of common stock, which will be issued to the selling unitholders of Cogent, on the second or fourth anniversary of the Acquisition, as the case may be, if the revenue target related to the Earnout is achieved.  In the event that the revenue target is achieved, such shares will be included in the Company s share count in the period that the target is achieved.  If the revenue target is not achieved on either the second or fourth anniversary, such shares of common stock will not be issued.  See  Note 3   Acquisition .  

Note 11   Income Taxes 
  The Company's effective tax rate varies depending on the jurisdiction in which the income is earned.  Certain foreign sourced income is taxed at a lower effective rate than U.S. income.  
  Under the requirements of ASC 740, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest its non-U.S. subsidiaries earnings outside the United States and does not provide for residual U.S. tax on these earnings. 
  The Company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset, which relates principally to compensation expense deducted for book purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes, will be realized as offsets to: (i) the realization of its deferred tax liabilities and (ii) future taxable income.  
  Any gain or loss resulting from the translation of deferred taxes for foreign affiliates is included in the foreign currency translation adjustment incorporated as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity and the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  
  The Company's income tax returns are routinely examined by the U.S. federal, U.S. state, and international tax authorities.  The Company regularly assesses its tax positions with respect to applicable income tax issues for open tax years in each respective jurisdiction in which the Company operates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not believe the resolution of any current ongoing income tax examinations will have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the Company.  

Note 12   Regulatory Requirements 
  Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to various regulatory requirements in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and certain other jurisdictions, which specify, among other requirements, minimum net capital requirements for registered broker-dealers.

Overview 
  Greenhill is a leading independent investment bank that provides financial and strategic advice on significant domestic and cross-border mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, financings, capital raisings and other strategic transactions to a diverse client base, including corporations, partnerships, institutions and governments globally.  We act for clients located throughout the world from our global offices in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. 
  Our revenues are principally derived from advisory services on mergers and acquisitions (or M A), financings and restructurings and are primarily driven by total deal volume and the size of individual transactions.  Additionally, our global capital advisory group provides capital raising advisory services in the primary market for real estate funds, where revenues are driven primarily by the amount of capital raised, and in the secondary market for alternative assets, where revenue is determined based upon a fixed percentage of the transaction value.  
  Greenhill was established in 1996 by Robert F. Greenhill, the former President of Morgan Stanley and former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Smith Barney. Since our founding, Greenhill has grown by recruiting talented managing directors and other senior professionals, by acquiring complementary advisory businesses and by training, developing and promoting professionals internally.  We have expanded beyond merger and acquisition advisory services to include financing, restructuring and capital advisory services, and we have expanded the breadth of our sector expertise to cover substantially all major industries.   Since the opening of our original office in New York, we have expanded globally to 15 offices across five continents. 
  Over our 20 years as an independent investment banking firm, we have sought to opportunistically recruit new managing directors with a range of industry and transaction specialties, as well as high-level corporate and other relationships, from major investment banks, independent financial advisory firms and other institutions.  We also have sought to expand our geographic reach both through recruiting managing directors in new locations and through strategic acquisitions, such as our 2006 acquisition of Beaufort Partners Limited (now Greenhill Canada) in Canada and our 2010 acquisition of Caliburn Partnership Pty Limited (now Greenhill Australia) in Australia.  Additionally, we expanded the breadth of our advisory services through the recruitment of a team of managing directors focused on real estate capital advisory services, through the hiring of managing directors to focus on financing and restructuring advisory services, and through our acquisition in 2015 of Cogent (now Greenhill Cogent), which provides advisory services related to the secondary fund placement market.  Through our recruiting and acquisition activity, we have significantly increased our geographic reach by adding offices in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Sweden, Brazil and Singapore.  We intend to continue our efforts to recruit new managing directors  
  
   21 

with industry sector experience and/or geographic reach who can help expand our advisory capabilities. During   2016  , we have announced the recruitment of five M A focused managing directors who have joined our teams in New York, London, Houston and Toronto and have expanded our coverage in the Canadian and Latin American markets and the energy and chemicals sectors. 

Business Environment 
  Global economic and financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance. See  Risk Factors  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with Securities and Exchange Commission. Global deal activity was adversely affected in the first nine months of 2016 due to volatility in the stock, credit and commodity markets, particularly in the first quarter of the year, and again more recently as a result of the United Kingdom's vote in June 2016 to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit".  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the number of completed transactions globally decreased   7%   versus the same period in the prior year, while the volume of completed transactions (reflecting the sum of all transaction sizes) decreased by   6%  . The number of announced transactions globally decreased   3%   during the nine months ended September 30,   2016   versus the same period in the prior year, while the volume of announced transactions decreased by   26%  .  1     
  Looking forward, volatility in the global economic and financial markets may persist, including repercussions of Brexit and the U.S. presidential election, which could impact our business. The full impact of Brexit remains uncertain, and it is likely to take a significant period of time before the future terms of the U.K.'s relationship with the European Union are determined. We currently expect that the most significant potential impact of Brexit on the Firm will likely relate to the impact, if any, on transaction activity in the U.K. and continental Europe, which could impact the amount and timing of our revenues in connection with U.K. transactions.  We also cannot predict the implications, if any, of the U.S. presidential election on the domestic and global economic conditions and markets and the consequential impact on transaction activity and, in turn, the Firm.   
  For the Firm, our revenues were   $76.6 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $50.6 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  , an increase of   $26.0 million  , or   51%  .  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our revenues were   $233.9 million   compared to   $185.9 million   in the same period in   2015  , an increase of   $48.0 million  , or   26%  .  Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a diverse mix of M A, financing, restructuring and fund placement transactions across multiple industry sectors, with a significant driver being the closing of major transactions.  In terms of geographic diversity, during the first nine months of   2016  , our most significant transaction activity was in the U.S., the U.K and continental Europe, while we also had multiple transaction closings in Brazil despite a challenging economic and political environment. 
   We view pre-tax margin as a key measure of operating performance.  As a result of our increased revenues in the   third quarter   of   2016   and the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015  , our pre-tax earnings for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $19.2 million   and   $55.5 million  , respectively, representing pre-tax profit margins of   25%   for the   third quarter   of   2016   and   24%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to pre-tax profit margins of   2%   for the   third quarter   of   2015   and   16%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .   
  We believe our business performance is best measured over longer periods of time, as we generally experience significant variations in revenues and profits from quarter to quarter.  These variations can generally be attributed to the fact that our revenues are typically earned in large amounts throughout the year upon the successful completion of a transaction or restructuring or closing of a fund, the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to our control.  Accordingly, revenues and net income in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter.

Results of Operations 
  Revenues  
  Substantially all of our revenues are derived from fees earned in connection with advising clients on mergers, acquisitions, financings, restructurings, capital advisory transactions, or similar transactions, and are primarily driven by total deal volume, the number of transactions and the size of individual transactions.  A majority of our advisory revenue is contingent upon the closing of a merger, acquisition, financing, restructuring, capital fund transaction or other advisory transaction.  While fees payable upon the successful conclusion of a transaction generally represent the largest portion of our fees, we also earn on-going retainer fees, substantially all of which relate to non-success based strategic advisory and financing advisory and restructuring assignments, and fees payable upon the commencement of an engagement or upon the achievement of certain milestones, such as the announcement of a transaction or the rendering of a fairness opinion.  Additionally, in our capital advisory engagements, revenues are generated in primary capital raising transactions largely by the amount of capital raised and in secondary sale transactions primarily by the value of the interests transferred.  Fees earned in primary capital raising transactions are based upon a percentage of capital committed to the fund at each interim closing and at the final closing for the amount of capital committed since the last interim closing.  Fees earned in secondary transactions are based upon a percentage of the value of the interests sold at the closing of each transaction. 
  We also generate a small portion of our revenues from gains (or losses) in merchant banking fund investments and interest income.    Revenue recognized on investments in merchant banking funds is based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains (or losses) reported by such funds on a quarterly basis.  
  We earned   $76.6 million   in revenues in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $50.6 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  , an increase of   $26.0 million  , or   51%  .  The increase in revenues principally resulted from an increase in completed transaction fees, offset in part by a decrease in announcement fees and retainer fee revenue.   
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , revenues were   $233.9 million   compared to   $185.9 million   in   2015  , an increase of   $48.0 million  , or   26%  . This increase principally resulted from an increase in completed transaction fees, offset in part by a decrease in announcement fees and retainer fee revenue. 
  Completed assignments in the   third quarter   of   2016   included: 

the representation of Airopack Technology Group AG on a placement of debt and equity capital and the acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in Airolux AG;

During the   third quarter   of   2016  , our capital advisory group advised real estate fund general partners on one interim closing of primary capital commitments from institutional investors.  Our secondary capital advisory group (Greenhill Cogent) advised institutional investors on   21   closings of sales of limited partnership interests in secondary market transactions. 
  We generally experience significant variations in revenues during each quarterly period.  These variations can generally be attributed to the fact that a majority of our revenues is usually earned in large amounts throughout the year upon the successful completion of transactions, the timing of which are uncertain and are not subject to our control.  Accordingly, the revenues earned in any particular period may not be indicative of revenues earned in future periods.  

Operating Expenses 
  We classify operating expenses as employee compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses.  Operating expenses include non-compensation costs for occupancy and equipment rental, information services, professional fees, recruiting, travel and entertainment, insurance, communications, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and other operating expenses.  A portion of certain costs are reimbursed by clients under the terms of client engagements and are netted against non-compensation expenses. 
  Our total operating expenses for the   third quarter   of   2016   were   $57.4 million  , which compared to   $49.5 million   of total operating expenses for the   third quarter   of   2015  .  This represents an increase in total operating expenses of   $7.9 million  , or   16%  , and resulted principally from an increase in our compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by a decrease in non-compensation expenses, both as described in more detail below.  The pre-tax profit margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   25%   as compared to   2%   for the same period in   2015  , which was negatively impacted by significantly lower revenues.   
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , total operating expenses were   $178.4 million  , compared to   $156.8 million   of total operating expenses for the same period in   2015  .  The increase of   $21.6 million  , or   14%  , resulted principally from an increase in our compensation and benefits expenses, offset in part by a decrease in non-compensation expenses, both as described in more detail below.  The pre-tax profit margin for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   24%   as compared to   16%   for the same period in   2015  .  
  The following table sets forth information relating to our operating expenses, which are reported net of reimbursements of certain expenses by our clients:  

Compensation and Benefits Expenses 
  Our employee compensation and benefits expenses in the   third quarter   of   2016   were   $40.7 million  , which reflected a   53%   ratio of compensation to revenues.  This amount compared to   $30.7 million   for the   third quarter   of   2015  , which reflected a   61%   ratio of compensation to revenues.  The increase of   $10.0 million  , or   33%  , was principally attributable to significantly higher revenues during the period, partially offset by a lower compensation ratio as we focused on an appropriate level of compensation for the full year.   
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our employee compensation and benefits expenses were   $129.4 million  , which reflected a   55%   ratio of compensation to revenues.  This amount compared to   $103.7 million   for the same period in the prior year, which reflected a   56%   ratio of compensation to revenues. The increase of   $25.7 million  , or   25%  , was principally attributable to higher year to date revenues offset by a slightly lower compensation ratio. 
  
   24 

For the full year 2016, dependent on the timing of revenue generation from the successful completion of certain pending transaction, we currently expect our compensation expense ratio to be slightly lower than last year's full year rate, while at the same time providing for increased compensation for our key employees. 
  Our compensation expense is generally based upon revenues and can fluctuate materially in any particular period depending upon changes in headcount, amount of revenues recognized, as well as other factors.  Accordingly, the amount of compensation expense recognized in any particular period may not be indicative of compensation expense in future periods. 
  Non-Compensation Expenses 
  Our non-compensation expenses were   $16.6 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $18.8 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015  , reflecting a decrease of   $2.2 million  , or   11%  . The decrease in non-compensation expenses principally resulted from lower occupancy costs related to reduced cost levels outside of the U.S., the sublease of redundant Cogent space and the absence of foreign currency losses, primarily related to our Brazilian operations.  Interest expense for the quarter, included within non-compensation expenses, was   $0.9 million  . 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our non-compensation expenses were   $49.0 million   compared to   $53.1 million   for the same period in   2015  , representing a decrease of   $4.1 million  , or   8%  . The decrease in non-compensation expenses principally resulted from lower occupancy costs as discussed above, the absence of foreign currency losses, lower professional fees due to the absence of transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Cogent, partially offset by incremental operating and borrowing costs related to Greenhill Cogent and an increase in the charge for the change in the estimated fair value of the contingent cash consideration for the Cogent earnout.  Interest expense for the first nine months of   2016  , included within non-compensation expense, was   $2.4 million  . 
  Non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   were   22%   compared to   37%   for the same period in   2015  .  Non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   21%   compared to   29%   for the same period in the prior year.  The decrease in non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues in both the three and nine month periods ended September 30,   2016   as compared to the same periods in   2015   resulted from the effect of spreading lower non-compensation costs over significantly higher revenues. 
  Our non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues can vary in any particular period as a result of a variety of factors including fluctuation in revenue amounts, changes in headcount, the amount of recruiting and business development activity, the amount of office space expansion, the amount of reimbursement of engagement-related expenses by clients, the amount of our borrowings, costs associated with acquisitions, interest rate and currency movements and other factors.  Accordingly, the non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues in any particular period may not be indicative of the non-compensation expenses as a percentage of revenues in future periods. 

Provision for Income Taxes 
  For the   third quarter   of   2016  , the provision for income taxes was   $6.1 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   32%  .  This compared to a provision for income taxes in the   third quarter   of   2015   of   $0.5 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   40%  .  The increase in the provision for income taxes in the   third quarter   of   2016   as compared to the same period in the prior year was principally attributable to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, which resulted from the generation of a greater proportion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the provision for taxes was   $18.4 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   33%  .  This compared to a provision for taxes for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   of   $11.4 million  , which reflected an effective tax rate of   39%  .  The increase in the provision for income taxes in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   resulted from higher pre-tax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, which resulted from the generation of a greater proportion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 
  The effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of variations in the amount of income earned and the tax rate imposed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.  Accordingly, the effective tax rate in any particular period may not be indicative of the effective tax rate in future periods. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our liquidity position, which consists of cash, other significant working capital assets and liabilities, debt and other matters relating to liquidity requirements and current market conditions, is monitored by management on a regular basis.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $55.8 million  , of which   $39.4 million   was held outside the U.S.  We retain our cash in financial institutions with high credit ratings and/or invest in short-term investments which are expected to provide liquidity.  
  
   25 

We generate substantially all of our cash from advisory fees.  We use our cash primarily for recurring operating expenses and the payment of dividends and non-recurring disbursements such as the repayment of debt obligations, the repurchase of shares of our common stock and the funding of leasehold improvements for the build out of office space.  Our recurring monthly operating disbursements principally consist of base compensation expense, occupancy, travel and entertainment, and other operating expenses.  Our recurring quarterly and annual disbursements consist of cash bonus payments, tax payments, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock from our employees in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities incurred on vesting of restricted stock units.  These amounts vary depending upon our profitability and other factors.  
  Because a portion of the compensation we pay to our employees is distributed in annual cash bonus awards (usually in February of each year), our net cash balance is typically at its lowest level during the first quarter of each year and generally accumulates from our operating activities throughout the remainder of the year.  In general, we collect our accounts receivable within 60 days, except for fees generated through our primary capital advisory engagements, which are generally paid in installments over a period of three years, and certain restructuring transactions, where collections may take longer due to court-ordered holdbacks.  At   September 30, 2016  , we had advisory fees receivable of   $76.6 million  , including long-term receivables related to our primary capital advisory engagements of   $30.7 million  .   
  Our current liabilities typically consist of accounts payable, which are generally paid monthly, accrued compensation, which includes accrued cash bonuses that are generally paid in the first quarter of the following year to the large majority of our employees, and current taxes payable.  In February 2016, cash bonuses and accrued benefits of   $13.9 million   relating to 2015 compensation were paid to our employees.  In addition, during the first nine months of   2016  , we paid   $18.4 million   related to income taxes owed principally in the U.S. and the   U.K.   for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  To provide for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes in the U.S, we have a   $70.0 million   revolving bank loan facility, which matures   April 30, 2017  .  Historically, we have been able to extend the maturity date of the revolving bank loan facility for a new one-year period shortly before maturity of the exiting loan facility.  We expect to renew the revolving bank loan facility in future periods although our ability to do so in the future is not certain.  The revolving bank loan facility bears interest at the higher of the Prime Rate or   3.5%  .  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $62.5 million   outstanding under the revolving bank loan facility. 
  In addition, to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid for our acquisition of Cogent in April 2015, we borrowed   $45.0 million   from our bank lender through two bank term loan facilities, each in an original principal amount of   $22.5 million  .  One term loan was paid in full prior to its maturity on   April 30, 2016   and the other loan facility is payable in four equal semi-annual installments beginning on   October 31, 2016  . The first installment of   $5.6 million   due in October 2016 was paid in August 2016.  The bank term loan facilities may be prepaid without penalty but amounts prepaid may not be reborrowed.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $16.9 million   outstanding related to the term loan facility with the next installments due on April 30, 2017 and October 31, 2017 and with a final maturity on April 30, 2018.   
  The interest rate applicable to the facility that matured in April 2016 was equal to the Prime Rate plus three-quarters of one percent (0.75%) per annum. The interest rate generally applicable to the bank term loan facility maturing in April 2018 is equal to the Prime rate plus one and one-quarter percent (1.25%) per annum and will be reduced to the Prime Rate plus three-quarters of one percent (  0.75%  ) per annum when the amount outstanding on such bank term loan facility is   $7.5 million   or less.  The interest rate applicable to each of the bank term loan facilities can never be less than four percent (4.00%) per annum.   
  Both the revolving bank loan facility and the bank term loan facilities are secured by any cash distributed in respect of the Company s investment in the U.S. based merchant banking fund, cash distributions from G Co and GCI, and advisory fees receivable of G Co.  In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness requires the prior approval of our lender.  Further, the Company is required to comply with certain financial and liquidity covenants on a quarterly basis.  At   September 30, 2016  , we were compliant with all loan covenants and we expect to continue to be compliant with all loan covenants in future periods.  
   As additional contingent consideration for the purchase of Cogent, we agreed to pay   $18.9 million   in cash and issue   334,048   shares of our common stock in the future if the Earnout is achieved.  The cash payment and the issuance of common shares will be made if Greenhill Cogent achieves a revenue target of $80.0 million during either the two-year period ending on the second anniversary of the closing (April 1, 2017) or the two year period ending on the fourth anniversary of the closing (April 1, 2019).  If the revenue target is achieved, the contingent consideration will be paid on the second or fourth anniversary date of the closing, as applicable.  If the revenue target is achieved during both Earnout periods, only one payment will be made at the end of the first Earnout period.  If the revenue target is not achieved during either of the two-year Earnout periods, a payment will not be made.  In the event the Earnout is achieved we expect the cash payment will be funded through either cash generated from operations, additional borrowings from the revolving bank loan facility, or additional bank term borrowing.  Due to the uncertainty of future market conditions, we are not currently able to determine with certainty whether or not the revenue target for the period ending on the second anniversary of the Acquisition will be achieved.  
  
   26 

Historically, we have generated significant earnings outside of the U.S. and we have repatriated a substantial portion of foreign earnings in excess of local working capital requirements and other forecast needs to the U.S.  To the extent we repatriate additional foreign earnings we will be subject to incremental U.S. tax on amounts repatriated for the difference between the U.S. tax rate of 35% and the lower rate of tax paid in the foreign jurisdictions.  Due to this potential incremental tax burden, it is our intention to retain our foreign earnings offshore indefinitely to reinvest in our non-U.S. operations unless circumstances change.  We increased our U.S. revolving loan facility earlier this year and may consider further increasing our borrowing in the future in order to provide adequate financial flexibility in the U.S. without accessing our foreign cash holdings.  In the event we are unable to meet our U.S. cash needs with cash generated domestically, or through borrowings, we could incur additional U.S. tax on amounts repatriated.  Presently, the majority of our foreign cash is held in the U.K. and Germany, which are currently subject to corporate tax rates of approximately   20%   and   32%  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had principal investments of   $3.5 million  , which consists of many small investments in our previously sponsored and other merchant banking funds.  Because merchant banking funds typically invest in privately held companies, the ability of the merchant banking funds to sell or dispose of the securities they own depends on a number of factors beyond the control of the funds, including general economic and sector conditions, stock market conditions, commodity prices, and the availability of financing to potential buyers of such securities, among other issues.  As a result, we consider our investments in the merchant banking funds illiquid for the short term.  At   September 30, 2016  , we do not have any remaining commitments to fund capital calls for principal investments, and we do not intend to make any principal investments going forward.  
  In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of our common stock during 2016.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   626,455   shares of our common stock in open market purchases and are deemed to have repurchased   319,194   shares of our common stock in connection with the cash settlement of tax liabilities incurred in respect of stock delivered to our employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units.  In aggregate for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   945,649   shares of common stock at an average price of   $21.86   per share for a total cost of   $20.7 million  . While we expect to fund future repurchases of our common stock (if any) with operating cash flow, we are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of our share repurchases.  Any future repurchases of our common stock will be dependent upon our cash flow generation and take into account the payment of dividends, repayment of the remaining bank term loan facility, potential obligations under the Earnout and other relevant factors. 
   Under the terms of our stock equity plan, we generally repurchase from our employees that portion of restricted stock unit awards used to fund income tax withholding due at the time the restricted stock unit awards vest.  Based upon the number of restricted stock unit grants outstanding at   October 20, 2016  , we estimate repurchases of our common stock from our employees in conjunction with the cash settlement of tax liabilities incurred on vesting of restricted stock units of approximately   $41.0 million   (as calculated based upon the closing share price as of   October 20, 2016   of   $22.65   per share and assuming a withholding tax rate of   39%  ) over the next five years, of which   $0.02 million   remains payable in 2016,   $9.9 million   will be payable in   2017  ,   $10.4 million   will be payable in   2018  ,   $9.2 million   will be payable in   2019  ,   $8.2 million   will be payable in   2020   and   $3.3 million   will be payable in   2021  . We will realize a corporate income tax benefit concurrently with the cash settlement payments.  
  Since 2004, we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders and dividend equivalent payments to our employees who hold restricted stock units.  Our quarterly dividend has been   $0.45   per share since 2007.  For the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we made dividend distributions of   $58.9 million  , or   $1.80   per common share and outstanding restricted stock unit.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we made dividend distributions of   $46.4 million  , or   $1.35   per common share and outstanding restricted stock unit. We have declared a dividend of $0.45 per common share payable in December 2016.  We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends, subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders.  Future declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, obligations under our bank loan facility, potential obligations under the Earnout, contractual restrictions and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
  While we believe that the cash generated from operations and borrowings from the revolving bank loan facility will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs, tax obligations, bank term loan repayments, common dividend payments, share repurchases, potential obligation under the Earnout and build-out costs of new office space, we may adjust our variable expenses and other disbursements, if necessary, to meet our liquidity needs.  There is no assurance that our current lender will continue to renew our revolving loan facility annually on comparable terms, and at the current borrowing amount or at all, and if it is not renewed that we would be able to obtain a new credit facility from a different lender.  In that case, we could be required to promptly repatriate foreign earnings, issue additional securities, reduce operating costs or take a combination of these actions, in each case on terms which may not be favorable to us.  In the event that we are not able to meet our liquidity needs, we may consider a range of financing alternatives to meet any such needs.

Cash Flows 
  In the nine months ending   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents decreased by   $14.1 million   from   December 31, 2015  , including a decrease of   $5.5 million   from the effect of the translation of foreign currency amounts into U.S. dollars at the quarter-end foreign currency conversion rates. We generated   $59.4 million   from operating activities, which consisted of   $69.7 million   from net income after giving effect to non-cash items offset by a net increase in working capital of   $10.3 million  , principally from an increase in advisory receivables offset by an increase in accrued income taxes.  We used   $1.3 million   in investing activities to fund equipment purchases and leasehold improvements.  We used   $66.7 million   in financing activities, including   $16.9 million   for the repayment of the bank term loan facilities,   $46.4 million   for the payment of dividends,   $8.0 million   for the repurchase of our common stock from employees in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities in settlement of restricted stock units,   $12.7 million   for open market repurchases of our common stock, and   $5.4 million   of tax costs related to delivery of restricted stock units at a vesting price lower than the grant price, offset in part by the net borrowings of   $22.7 million   on our revolving bank loan facility. 
  In the nine months ending   September 30, 2015  , our cash and cash equivalents decreased by   $15.7 million   from   December 31, 2014  , including a decrease of   $1.3 million   from the effect of the translation of foreign currency amounts into U.S. dollars at the quarter-end foreign currency conversion rates.  We generated   $51.6 million   from operating activities, which consisted of   $51.9 million   from net income after giving effect to non-cash items offset by a net increase in working capital of   $0.3 million   principally from the payment of annual bonuses offset by a decrease in advisory fees receivable.  We used   $46.5 million   for investing activities, principally as a result of the net payment of   $45.3 million   for the acquisition of Cogent, including transaction costs, and   $2.0 million   for leasehold improvements and other capital expenditures, offset in part by proceeds of   $0.8 million   from merchant banking fund investments.  We used   $19.5 million   in financing activities, including   $44.3 million   for the payment of dividends,   $11.9 million   for the repurchase of our common stock from employees in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities in settlement of restricted stock units, and   $6.4 million   of tax costs related to delivery of restricted stock units at a vesting price lower than the grant price, offset in part by the net borrowing of   $33.8 million   of bank term loan facilities (  $45.0 million   of bank term loans to finance Cogent, net of a repayment of   $11.3 million  ), and net borrowings of   $9.3 million   on our revolving bank loan facility. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not invest in any off-balance sheet vehicles that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or engage in any leasing or hedging activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Market Risk 
  Our investments are principally limited to short-term cash investments, which we believe do not face any material interest rate risk, equity price risk or other market risk.  We maintain our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings.  Although these deposits are generally not insured, management believes we are not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held. 
  We monitor the quality of our investments on a regular basis and may choose to diversify such investments to mitigate perceived market risk. Our cash and cash equivalents are denominated in U.S. dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, pound sterling, euros, yen, Swedish krona and Brazilian real, and we face foreign currency risk in our cash balances held in accounts outside the United States due to potential currency movements and the associated foreign currency translation accounting requirements.  We currently do not hedge our foreign currency exposure, but we may do so if we expect we will need to fund U.S. dollar obligations with foreign currency.  
  In addition, the reported amounts of our advisory revenues may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, pound sterling, euro, yen, krona and real (in which collectively   32%   of our revenues for the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016   were denominated) and the dollar, in which our financial statements are denominated. We do not currently hedge against movements in these exchange rates.  We analyzed our potential exposure to a decline in exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis on our net income in those jurisdictions in which we have historically generated a significant portion of our foreign earnings, which include the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.  During the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , the value of the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the pound sterling, and remained relatively constant with the Australian dollar and euro.  In aggregate, although there was a negative impact on our revenues in the first nine months of   2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   as a result of movements in the foreign currency exchange rates, we did not deem the impact significant due to the timing of receipts and the mix of currencies we received, including the negotiation for the payment of certain foreign transaction fees in U.S. dollars.  While our earnings are subject to volatility from changes in foreign currency rates, we do not believe we face any material risk in this respect.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  Descriptions of our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, are set forth above in "Item 1   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited), Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  and are incorporated by reference herein. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are set forth above in  Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Market Risk . 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Firm's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )).  Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  
  No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
