1      ORGANIZATION
                                         AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

a)      Organization   

On May 12, 2016, QPAGOS (formerly
known as Asiya Pearls, Inc.), a Nevada corporation ( QPAGOS ), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger
Agreement ) with Qpagos Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( Qpagos Corporation ), and Qpagos Merge, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of QPAGOS ( Merger Sub ).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
on May 12, 2016, the merger was consummated and Qpagos Corporation and Merger Sub merged (the  Merger ), with Qpagos
Corporation continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger.  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement,
upon consummation of the Merger, each share of Qpagos Corporation s capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Merger was converted into the right to receive two shares of QPAGOS common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Common
Stock ). Additionally, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, QPAGOS assumed all of Qpagos Corporation s
warrants issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, which are now exercisable for approximately 6,219,200 shares
of Common Stock, respectively, as of the date of the Merger. Prior to and as a condition to the closing of the Merger, the then-current
QPAGOS stockholder of 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock agreed to return to QPAGOS 4,975,000 shares of Common Stock held by such
holder to QPAGOS and the then-current QPAGOS stockholder retained an aggregate of 25,000 shares of Common Stock and the other
stockholders of QPAGOS retained 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock. Therefore, immediately following the Merger, Qpagos Corporation s
former stockholders held 49,929,000 shares of QPAGOS common stock which represented approximately 91% of the outstanding Common
Stock. 

The Merger is being treated
as a reverse acquisition of QPAGOS, a public shell company, for financial accounting and reporting purposes. As such, Qpagos Corporation
is treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes while QPAGOS is treated as the acquired entity for
accounting and financial reporting purposes. Further, as a result, the historical financial statements that are reflected in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and that will be reflected in the Company s future financial statements filed with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) will be those of Qpagos Corporation, and the Company s assets,
liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Qpagos Corporation. 

Qpagos Corporation was incorporated
on May 1, 2015 under the laws of Delaware under the name Qpagos Corporation as the holding company for two 99.99% owned operating
subsidiaries, QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and Redpag Electr nicos S.A.P.I. de C.V. Each of these entities were incorporated
in November 2013 in Mexico. 

QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. was
formed to process payment transactions for service providers it contracts with, and Redpag Electr nicos S.A.P.I. de C.V.
was formed to deploy and operate kiosks as a distributor. 

On August 31, 2015, QPAGOS
Corporation entered into various agreements with the shareholders of Qpagos and Redpag to give effect to a reverse merger transaction
(the  Reverse Merger''). Pursuant to the Reverse Merger, the majority of the shareholders of Qpagos and Redpag effectively
received shares in Qpagos Corporation, through various consulting and management agreements entered into with Qpagos Corporation
and sold an effective 99.996% and 99.990% of the outstanding shares on Qpagos and Redpag, respectively to Qpagos Corporation.
The series of transactions closed effective August 31, 2015. Upon the close of the Reverse Merger, Qpagos Corporation became the
parent of Qpagos and Redpag and assumed the operations of these two companies as its sole business. 

On May 27, 2016 Asiya changed
its name to QPAGOS. QPAGOS and its direct and indirect subsidiaries Qpagos Corporation, QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and Redpag Electr nicos
S.A.P.I. de C.V., will be referred to hereafter as  the Company . 

On June 1, 2016, the board
of directors changed the Company s fiscal year end from October 31 to December 31. 

b)   
       Description
    of the business    

QPAGOS, through its indirect
subsidiaries QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and Redpag Electr nicos S.A.P.I. de C.V., provides physical and virtual payment services
to the Mexican market. The Company provides an integrated network of kiosks, terminals and payment channels that enable consumers
in Mexico to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form and remit the funds to any merchant in our network quickly and securely.
The Company helps consumers and merchants connect more efficiently in markets and consumer segments, such as Mexico, that are
largely cash-based and lack convenient alternatives for consumers to pay for goods and services in physical, online and mobile
environments. For example, the Company s licensed technology can be used to pay bills, add minutes to mobile phones, purchase
transportation tickets, shop online or at a retail store, buy digital services or send money to a friend or relative.

2      ACCOUNTING
                                         POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

a)   
       Basis of Presentation    
 
 The accompanying unaudited
condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S.
GAAP ) for interim financial information with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
these unaudited condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for
complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include
all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments), which the Company considers necessary, for a fair presentation
of those financial statements. The results of operations and cash flows for the three months and nine months ended September 30,
2016 may not necessarily be indicative of results that may be expected for any succeeding quarter or for the entire fiscal year.
The information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
of Qpagos Corporation included in the current report on Form 8-K/A as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
on December 12, 2016. 

All amounts referred to in
the notes to the financial statements are in United States Dollars ($) unless stated otherwise. 

b)   
       Principles of Consolidation    
 
 The consolidated financial
statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary and its indirect subsidiaries. All
significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The entities
included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: 

QPAGOS   Parent Company
QPAGOS Corporation   100% owned 

 QPagos, S.A. P.I de C.V., a Mexican
entity (99.996% owned) 

 Redpag Electr nicos, S.A.
P.I. de C.V., a Mexican entity (99.990% owned) 

c)   
       Mexican Operations    
 
 The financial statements of
the Company s Mexican operations are measured using local currencies as their functional currencies. 

The Company translates the
assets and liabilities of its Mexican subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect at year end and the results of operations at
the average rate throughout the year. The translation adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders 
equity, while transaction gains (losses) are included in net income (loss). All sales to customers are in Mexico. 

d)   
       Use of Estimates    
 
 The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on
an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of
revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment,
the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential
magnitude of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing
operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Making estimates requires management
to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation
or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating
its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could
differ significantly from our estimates.

e)      Risks and Uncertainties   
  
 The Company's operations will
be subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated, including
the potential risk of business failure. The recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets,
lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed
income markets. These conditions not only limit the Company s access to capital, but also make it difficult for its customers,
vendors and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. 

The Company s operations
are carried out in Mexico. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced
by the political, economic and legal environment in Mexico and by the general state of that economy. The Company s results
may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures,
and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. 

f)      Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
  
 In June 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  ASU 2016-13 will replace the current
incurred loss approach with an expected loss model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances
for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount under the current other-than-temporary impairment
model. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.
We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-13 will have on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2016, FASB issued
ASU 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity
in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently
evaluating the effect ASU 2016-15 will have on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.   

In October 2016, Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. ( ASU ) 2016-16,  Intra-Entity
Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.  ASU 2016-16 requires immediate recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany
asset transfers, other than inventory transfers.  Existing GAAP prohibits recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany
asset transfers whereby the seller defers any net tax effect and the buyer is prohibited from recognizing a deferred tax asset
on the difference between the newly created tax basis of the asset in its tax jurisdiction and its financial statement carrying
amount as reported in the consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2016-16 specifically excludes from its scope intercompany
inventory transfers whereby the recognition of tax consequences will take place when the inventory is sold to third parties. ASU
2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or
made available for issuance. We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-16 will have on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements.  

Any new accounting standards,
not disclosed above, that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected
to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. 

g)      Cash and Cash Equivalents   
  
 The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Company had no cash equivalents. 

The Company minimizes credit
risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution in the United States.
The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits. At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash balances in the United States,
which exceeded the federally insured limits by $531,238. At September 30, 2016, cash balances in the United States did not exceed
the federally insured limit. 

h)   
       Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts    
 
 Accounts receivable are reported
at realizable value, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue
is recorded. The Company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of its receivables based on a number
of factors, including the period they have been outstanding. Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral
part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company regularly assesses the state
of its billing operations in order to identify issues, which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates.
Revisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense. Receivables deemed
uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written-off. Recoveries
of receivables previously written-off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts. There were no recoveries
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

i)   
       Cost Method
    Investments    
 
 Investee companies not accounted
for under the consolidation or the equity method are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Under this method, the
Company s share of earnings or losses of such investee companies is not included in the condensed consolidated balance sheet
or statement of comprehensive loss. However, impairment charges are recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive
loss. If circumstances suggest that the value of the investee company has subsequently recovered, such recovery is not recorded.
There is no impairment of investment at September 30, 2016.

j)      Inventory   
  
 The Company primarily values
inventories at the lower of cost or market applied on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company identifies and writes down its
excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value based on usage forecasts, order volume and inventory aging. With the development
of new products, the Company also rationalizes its product offerings and will write-down discontinued product to the lower of
cost or net realizable value. 

k)      Revenue Recognition   
  
 The Company s revenue
recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605). In general, the Company records revenue when it is realized, or realizable and earned.
The Company considers revenue to be realized, or realizable and earned when, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
products or services have been approved by the customer after delivery and/or installation acceptance or performance of services;
the sales price is fixed or determinable within the contract; and collectability is reasonably assured. 

The Company has the following
sources of revenue which is recognized on the basis described below. 

Revenue
                                         from the sale of services .     

Prepaid services are acquired
from providers and is sold to end-users through kiosks that the Company owns or kiosks that are owned by third parties. The Company
recognizes the revenue on the sale of these services when the end-user deposits funds into the terminal and the prepaid service
is delivered to the end-user. The revenue is recognized at the gross value, including margin, of the prepaid service to the Company,
net of any value-added tax which is collected on behalf of the Mexican Revenue Authorities. 

Payment
                                         processing provided to end-users      

The Company provides a secure
means for end-users to pay for certain services, such as utilities through our kiosks. The Company earns either a fixed per-transaction
fee or a fixed percentage of the service sold. The Company acts as a collection agent and recognizes the payment processing fee,
net of any value-added taxes collected on behalf of the Mexican Revenue Authorities, when the funds are deposited into the kiosk
and the customer has settled his liability or has acquired a prepaid service. 

Revenue
                                         from the sale of kiosks.      

The Company imports, assembles
and sell kiosks that are used to generate the revenues discussed above. Revenue is recognized on the full value of the kiosks
sold, net of any valued added taxation collected on behalf of the Mexican Revenue Authorities, when the customer takes delivery
of the kiosk and all the risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the customer. 

The Company does not enter
into any leasing of kiosks arrangements with customers and the Company does not generate any revenues from merchants who access
its terminals as yet. 

3      GOING
                                         CONCERN   

These financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities
in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since inception resulting in an accumulated
deficit of $8,031,286 as of September 30, 2016 and has not generated sufficient revenue to cover its operating expenditure, raising
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition to operational expenses, as the Company
executes its business plan, additional capital resources will be required. The Company will need to raise capital in the near
term in order to continue operating and executing its business plan. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and
repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Company s plan is to expand its market
penetration by deploying more kiosks through various channels, thereby increasing revenues. In addition, the Company intends to
raise additional equity or loan funds to meet its short term working capital needs. The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following
discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, Qpagos Corporation s audited
annual financial statements and the related notes thereto, each of which are included as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form
8- K/A filed with the SEC on December 12, 2016. Th is discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties, as described under the heading  Forward-Looking Statements  in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. For additional information
regarding these risks and uncertainties, please see the disclosure under the heading  Risk Factors  elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . The Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below
is based upon only the financial performance of Qpagos Corporation.  

For information
regarding the financial results of QPAGOS (formerly known as Asiya Pearls, Inc.), you should refer to Asiya s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on December 10, 2015, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended January 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2016. As a result of the Merger that was consummated
on May 12, 2016, the Company changed its fiscal year end to December 31 and filed a transitions report on December 12, 2016 on
   Form 10- Q/A for the period ended March 31, 2016. The Merger was treated as a reverse acquisition for financial accounting
and reporting purposes. As such, Qpagos Corporation was treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes
while Asiya Pearls, Inc. was treated as the acquired entity for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Further, as a result,
the historical financial statements that are reflected in the Company s financial statements filed with the SEC are those
of Qpagos Corporation and the Company s assets, liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with the assets,
liabilities and results of operations of Qpagos Corporation. Accordingly, for clarity and continuity, we are presenting the historical
financial statements for Qpagos Corporation for the periods presented. The financial statements presented in the Current Report
on Form 8-K/A filed on December 12, 2016,    the Transition Report on Form 10-Q/A filed on December 12,    2016
and this Quarterly Report on form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 are those of Qpagos Corporation and therefore,
a review of the financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2015, filed with the SEC
on December 10, 2015, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on February
19, 2016 may not be meaningful on a quantitative or qualitative basis.  

Overview and Financial Condition  

QPAGOS   

We are a provider
of next generation physical and virtual payment services that we introduced to the Mexican market in the third quarter of 2014. 

We provide an integrated
network of kiosks, terminals and payment channels that enable consumers to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form and remit
the funds to any merchant in our network quickly and securely. We help consumers and merchants connect more efficiently in markets
and consumer segments, such as Mexico, that are largely cash-based and lack convenient alternatives for consumers to pay for goods
and services in physical, online and mobile environments. For example, we license technology that can be used to pay bills, add
minutes to mobile phones, purchase transportation tickets, shop online, buy digital services or send money to a friend or relative. 

Our current focus
is on Mexico which remains a cash-dominated society for retail consumer payments with approximately 80% of the value of personal
payments exchanged in cash (Bank of Mexico). The penetration of electronic payment services, such as credit and debit cards and
point of sale terminals, significantly lags behind more developed economies. We believe that opportunities for our services in
Mexico are vast. With over 107 million mobile subscribers in Mexico, 88% of which are under prepaid plans, mobile top-up alone,
was a $12 billion business in 2014 as reported by PwC Telecom in Mexico 2015, America M vil 4Q 15. We believe that
there is opportunity for growth in the Mexican market and have expanded our service providers beyond the mobile telephone operators
to service providers of electricity, transportation, utilities, municipal services and taxes, consumer credit installments, insurance
premiums, and many more. Altogether as of the third quarter of 2016 our platform had integrated over 110 such services. 

1  

Our
primary strategy in Mexico to date has been the attraction of service providers as well as the deployment of kiosks through Redpag
Electr nicos S.A.P.I. de C.V., our kiosk management subsidiary. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Qpagos Corporation generated net revenues of $1,127,944 and $2,026,248, respectively,
from our operations in Mexico. Our primary sources of revenue are sales of prepaid services and payment processing fees. We also
generate revenue from non-payment services such as kiosk sales. Qpagos Corporation currently has in excess of 110 service providers
integrated into its payment gateway, which includes all mobile phone providers in Mexico as well as most utility companies, financial
services, entertainment venues and others. As of December 1, 2016, we have deployed over 201 kiosks and terminals, and we service
an additional 450 kiosks of an independent distributor. Our kiosks and terminals can be found at convenience stores, next to metro
stations, retail stores, airport terminals, education centers, and malls in major urban centers, as well as many small and rural
towns.  

In addition, we have
developed an electronic wallet which should enable consumers to hold balances in its kiosks for future use or to receive change.
Launched in the first quarter of 2016 customers can now use cash and/or stored value to pay for goods and services across physical
or virtual environments interchangeably. Also in the first quarter of 2016, we launched our mobile app by which smart phone users
can now access the exact menu of services available in our kiosks and make payments from the convenience of their phones. Cash
is uploaded to the electronic wallet app via kiosks. 

We believe that our
platform provides simple and intuitive user interfaces, convenient access and best-in-class services. We run our network and process
its transactions using a proprietary, advanced technology platform that leverages the latest virtualization, analytics and security
technologies to create a fast, highly reliable, secure and redundant system. We believe that the breadth and reach of our network,
along with the proprietary nature of its technology platform, differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to effectively
manage and update our services and realize significant operating leverage with growth in volumes. 

Management Discussion and Analysis
of financial condition   

The discussion and
analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements
as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires QPAGOS to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. On an on-going basis we review our estimates and assumptions. The estimates are based on our historical experience and
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 

Results of Operations for the Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

Net revenue  

Net revenues
were $769,897 and $363,580 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, an increase of $406,317 or
111.8%. Qpagos operates in Mexico and its functional currency is the Mexican Peso. Qpagos revenue in Mexican Pesos increased
to MXN 14,426,090 from MXN 5,973,219 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of MXN
8,452,871 or 141.5%. The increase in revenue in MXN Pesos is primarily due to an increase in the volume of prepaid services
sold from MXN 3,587,689 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to MXN 13,808,490 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, the increased deployment of kiosks during the current period, and we also increased the number of our customers
over the prior year. The average US $ exchange rate has strengthened against the MXN Peso over the prior period, from
$16.4289 to $18.7377 or 14.1%, which results in a lower revenue growth in US $ terms of $108,195. 

Cost of goods sold 

Cost of goods
sold was $736,021 and $311,779 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $424,242
or 136.1%. Qpagos  cost of goods sold in Mexican Pesos increased to MXN 13,791,347 from MXN 5,122,194 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of MXN 8,669,153 or 169.2%. The increase in cost of goods
sold in MXN Pesos is primarily due to the increase in the volume of prepaid services sold. Cost of goods sold consists
primarily of services acquired from third parties, such as prepaid services and the cost of the kiosks and any retrofitted
components. The average US $ exchange rate has strengthened against the MXN Peso over the prior period, from $16.4289 to
$18.7377 or 14.1%, which results in a lower cost of sales in US $ terms of approximately $103,435. 

2  

Gross profit  

Gross profit was $33,876
and $51,801 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease in gross profit of $17,925 or 34.6%.
The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue to 4.4% from 14.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively is primarily due to the volume of wholesale service sales which is at low margins due to the growth in our wholesale
customer base, which offsets the higher margins we earn on our kiosk sales and services and payment processing fees we earn on
the Company owned kiosks. 

Total expenses  

Total expenses were
$555,501 and $369,193 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $186,308 or 50.5%. 

Total expenses consisted primarily of
the following: 

c)  offset by a decrease in payroll and related costs of 16% as
                                         part of the Company s effort to control cost and streamline the business;   

d)  Further offset by a reduction of other minor overhead expenses.   

b)  Legal fees of
                                         8,309 related to general corporate matters. 

Other income  

Other income was $636
and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Interest expense, net  

Interest expense
of $3,025 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 consists primarily of interest on a loan due to YP Holdings. This loan
with a principal balance of $100,000 remains outstanding and earns interest at 12% per annum. 

Foreign currency loss  

The foreign currency
loss was $101,854 and $205,179 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $103,325. The
decrease is primarily due to the conversion of US Dollar denominated loans in the prior year into equity prior to the current
quarter. We continue to experience foreign currency losses on other US$ denominated liabilities, such as intercompany balances
due to the strengthening of the US $ exchange rate from an average of $16.4289 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $18.7377
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a strengthening of 14.1%. 

3  

Net loss  

We incurred a net
loss of $625,868 and $522,571, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $103,297 or
approximately 19.8%, primarily due to the increased operating expenses discussed above.

were $2,026,248 and $525,050 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, an increase of $1,501,198 or
285.9%. Qpagos operates in Mexico and its functional currency is the Mexican Peso. Qpagos  revenue in Mexican Pesos
increased to MXN 37,115,585 from MXN 8,443,126 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an
increase of MXN 28,672,459 or 339.6%. The increase in revenue in MXN Pesos is primarily due to an increase in the volume of
prepaid services sold from MXN 5,232,913 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to MXN 33,557,400 in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 the increased deployment of kiosks during the current year, and we also increased the number of our
customers over the prior year. The average US $ exchange rate has strengthened against the MXN Peso over the prior period,
from $15.6623 to $18.2859 or 16.8%, which results in a lower revenue growth in US $ terms of $343,492. 

Cost of goods sold  

Cost of goods
sold was $1,942,957 and $455,715 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of
$1,487,242 or 326.4%. Qpagos  cost of goods sold in Mexican Pesos increased to MXN 35,588,077 from MXN 7,293,645 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of MXN 28,294,432 or 387.9%. The increase in
cost of goods sold in MXN Pesos is primarily due to the increase in the volume of prepaid services sold. Cost of goods sold
consists primarily of services acquired from third parties, such as prepaid air time and the cost of the kiosks and any
retrofitted component. The average US $ exchange rate has strengthened against the MXN Peso over the prior period, from
$15.6623 to $18.2859 or 16.8%, which results in a lower cost of sales in US $ terms of approximately $329,255. 

Gross profit  

Gross profit was $83,291
and $69,335 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase in profit of $13,956 or 20.1%. The
decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue to 4.1% from 13.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively is primarily due to the volume of wholesale service sales which is at low margins due to the growth in our wholesale
customer base, which offsets the higher margins we earn on our kiosk sales and services and payment processing fees we earn on
the Company owned kiosks. 

Total expenses  

Total expenses were
$3,903,832 and $1,179,484 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $2,724,348 or 231.0%. 

Total expenses consisted primarily of
the following: 

c)  offset by a decrease in payroll and related costs of 3.6% as part of the Company s effort to control cost and streamline
the business;   

d)  further offset by a reduction of other minor overhead expenses.   

a)  Consulting fees
                                         expensed of $2,032,275 relating to consulting agreements entered into with various parties
                                         to assist us in developing the Mexican market, these consulting fees were settled by
                                         the issue of 2,572,500 shares of common stock of Qpagos Corporation which were exchanged
                                         for 5,145,000 shares of our Common Stock upon consummation of the reverse merger. 

b)  Executive salaries
                                         and consulting fees related to our information technology of $301,591 and $78,000 related
                                         to accounting services. 

d)  Legal fees of
                                         $63,797 primarily due to the reverse merger of the Company 

e)  Restricted stock
                                         awards of $144,000 related to the value of restricted stock issued to management in the
                                         prior year which was fully vested on April 30, 2016.

Other income  

Other income totaled
$4,651 and $471 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Interest expense, net  

Interest expense
of $9,008 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consists primarily of interest on a loan due to YP Holdings. This loan
with a principal balance of $100,000 remains outstanding and earns interest at 12% per annum. 

Foreign currency loss  

The foreign currency
loss was $216,699 and $418,368 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $201,669. The
decrease is primarily due to the conversion of US Dollar denominated loans in the prior year into equity prior to the current
quarter. The Company continues to experience foreign currency losses on other US$ denominated liabilities, such as intercompany
balances due to the strengthening of the US $ exchange rate from an average of $16.6623 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 to $18.2859 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a strengthening of 9.7%. 

Net loss  

We incurred a net
loss of $4,041,597 and $1,528,046, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $2,513,551
or approximately 164.5%, and which consist of the various items discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

To date, our primary
sources of cash have been funds raised from the sale of its securities and the issuance of debt as well as revenue derived from
operations. 

We incurred an accumulated
deficit of $8,031,286 through September 30, 2016 and incurred negative cash flow from operations of $1,342,098 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. We have spent, and need to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our
business strategy, including our planned product development effort and will be required to raise additional funding. 

We will need to generate
additional revenue from operations and/or obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy, repay our outstanding note
obligations and take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. To meet our financing needs, we are considering multiple
alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings and, debt financings and/or funding from partnerships.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise ad may have
to significantly curtail our operations. 

At September 30, 2016,
we had cash of $25,638 and a working capital of $543,545. We believe that the current cash balances together with revenue anticipated
to be generated from operations will not be sufficient to meet our current working capital needs and as mentioned above, we will
seek further funding from either equity issues or further debt funding, should we not be successful, we may have to curtail our
operations significantly. 

We utilized cash of $1,342,098, and $1,646,211
in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $304,113 or 18.5%.
Primarily due to an additional $387,737 increase in cash operating expenditure before working capital changes offset by an improvement
in working capital flows from a cash expenditure of $310,403 in the prior year to a net cash release of $364,302 during the current
period, an improvement of $674,686. 

We had minimal investment
in property and equipment of $453 and $3,975 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

We funded our operations
by utilizing our cash balances and raising an additional $330,000 by the issue of common securities to certain investors in a
private placement and an additional $60,000 was raised in debt issuances. 

Subsequent to September
30, 2016 we raised the following funds: 

an
                                         additional $225,000 was raised in debt issuances from five investors. The investors were
                                         issued notes in the aggregate principal amount of $225,000 that bear interest at a rate
                                         of 10% per annum and mature between February 13, 2017 and November 23, 2017, we will
                                         need to generate additional revenue from operations or raise further debt or equity funding
                                         in the next two months to repay these notes.   

We have minimal commitments
which include a lease of premises, with a future commitment of $8,185 for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

We entered into an
additional ten-year licensing agreement with the Licensor on May 1, 2015, whereby we are committed to pay an annual license fee
in quarterly installments of $5,000 ($20,000 per annum) to the Licensor for an exclusive license for the Mexican market of certain
revenue payment services. 

Our primary financial
commitments as of the date hereof are payments owed under the License Agreement. The minimum commitments due under the license
agreement is summarized as follows: 

5  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

None 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risks  

None. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls
and procedures Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company
carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive
Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that due to a lack of segregation of duties and insufficient
controls over review and accounting for certain complex transactions, that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2016 were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, was recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company intends to retain additional individuals to remedy the ineffective controls. We have begun to take actions that we
believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified. In response to the identification of our material weaknesses,
we are in the process of expanding our finance and accounting staff. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over
financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting  

 There has been no change in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings
or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings
that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of
defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Investing in our Company involves a
high degree of risk. In addition to the risks related to our business set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should
carefully consider the risks described below before investing in us. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently
known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.  

Risks Related to our Business   

Risks Relating to Our Business and
Industry  

We have had limited operations to date.   

Qpagos  Corporation s
subsidiaries were incorporated in November 2013 and began deploying kiosks in Mexico in November 2014. As such, we have a very
limited operating history. We have yet to demonstrate our ability to overcome the risks frequently encountered in the payment
services industry and are still subject to many of the risks common to early stage companies, including the uncertainty as to
our ability to implement our business plan, market acceptance of our proposed business and services, under-capitalization, cash
shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources and uncertainty of our ability to generate revenues.
There is no assurance that our activities will be successful or will result in any revenues or profit, and the likelihood of our
success must be considered in light of the stage of our development. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate
our business strategy and plans, or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations may force us to modify, alter,
significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of such plans. We have insufficient results for investors to use
to identify historical trends. Investors should consider our prospects in light of the risk, expenses and difficulties we will
encounter as an early stage company. Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually evolving.
We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able
to successfully address these risks. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements of QPAGOS
have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern.   

QPAGOS  operating
losses, negative cash flows from operations and limited alternative sources of revenue raise substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern.  The condensed consolidated financial statements of QPAGOS for the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  If
we or Qpagos Corporation cannot raise adequate capital on acceptable terms or generate sufficient revenue from operations, we
and Qpagos Corporation will need to revise our business plans. 

We may continue to generate operating losses and experience
negative cash flows and it is uncertain whether we will achieve profitability.   

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $4.0 million and $2.5 million,
respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $8.0 million through September 30, 2016. We expect to continue to incur operating
losses until such time, if ever, as we are able to achieve sufficient levels of revenue from operations. There can be no assurance
that we will ever generate significant sales or achieve profitability. Accordingly, the extent of future losses and the time required
to achieve profitability, if ever, cannot be predicted at this point. 

We also expect to
experience negative cash flows for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses. As a result, we will need to generate
significant revenues or raise additional financing in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate
these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability would likely negatively
impact the value of our securities and financing activities.

The payment services industry is highly competitive,
and we have a number of competitors that are larger and have greater financial and other resources.   

The payment services
industry is highly competitive, and our continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively. Although we do not face
direct competition from any competitor in exactly the same line of business, we face competition from a variety of financial and
non-financial business groups. These competitors include retail banks, non-traditional payment service providers, such as retailers
and mobile network operators, traditional kiosk and terminal operators and electronic payment system operators, as well as other
companies that provide various forms of payment services, including electronic payment and payment processing services. Competitors
in our industry seek to differentiate themselves by features and functionalities such as speed, convenience, network size, accessibility,
hours of operation, reliability and price. A significant number of our competitors have greater financial, technological and marketing
resources than we have, operate robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers. 

There is uncertainty as to market
acceptance of our technology and services.   

We have conducted
our own research into the markets for our services; however, because we are a new entrant into the market, we cannot guarantee
market acceptance of our services and have somewhat limited information on which to estimate our anticipated level of sales. Our
services require consumers and service providers to adopt our technology. Our industry is susceptible to rapid technological developments
and there can be no assurance that we will be able to match any new technological advances. If we are unable to match the technological
changes in the needs of our customers the demand for our products will be reduced. 

The technology upon which our business
is dependent is licensed from a third party under the terms of a ten year license agreement, which if terminated, would result
in the cessation of our business operations  . 

The license with Janor
Enterprises Ltd. (Janor) is for the rights to use three software programs upon which our business is completely dependent. The
agreement is for a term of ten years, and may be extended for an additional ten years but may be terminated early by Janor if
we fail to comply with its terms and conditions or make certain payments. The rights to the licensed programs terminate upon expiration
or termination of the agreement. We have no guarantee that Janor will renew our agreement upon expiration of the extended term.
If we are not able to maintain this license, we would have to cease operations unless we have developed or secured the rights
to technology that would provide the same functionality and we are able to reconfigure our installed base of kiosks, terminals
and other system infrastructure to work with the new technology. These hurdles would be extremely expensive and time consuming,
and it is unlikely that we would be able stay in business. 

Our exclusive right to the technology that we license
is subject to forfeiture if we fail to make certain quarterly payments.   

The technology that
we license from Janor is licensed pursuant to the terms of a license agreement. Subject to us making quarterly payments of $5,000
per quarter, Janor has agreed that neither it nor any of its subsidiary or affiliated entity will install a terminal and/or kiosk
that incorporates the Programs or a technology having the same or a similar effect nor will they provide any person or entity
with the right to install a terminal and/or kiosk in Mexico that incorporates the Programs or a technology having the same or
a similar effect; provided; however, If we should fail to make the quarterly payments, there is no prohibition from Janor licensing
the same technology to another entity in Mexico that could compete with us. If Janor were to license the same technology to a
third party our competitive position in Mexico could be substantially harmed. 

We rely on one outside vendor for
the supply of key kiosk parts and the partial or complete loss of this supplier could cause customer supply or production delays
and as a result potentially a loss of revenues.   

We rely on one outside
vendor based outside Mexico to manufacture substantial portions of critical hardware that are used with or included in our kiosks.
Although there are other suppliers that could supply the hardware required for the kiosks, we do not have a contract with such
other suppliers and therefore, if our present vendor was to delay or terminate its performance, our business would likely be disrupted. 

Our reliance on this
vendor is expected to continue and involves other risks, including our limited control over the availability of components, delivery
schedules, pricing and product quality. We may experience delays, additional expenses and lost sales as a result of our dependency
upon this vendor. Although we expect that other existing vendors would be able to supply us with any needed products if this vendor
was to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply us with an adequate supply of required parts, if these other
existing vendors were unable to supply us in a timely manner, or on comparable terms, our business could be materially adversely
impacted. 

8  

Our reliance on outside
suppliers for our kiosk hardware involves several risks, including the following: 

our suppliers of required
    parts may cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply us with an adequate supply of required parts for a number
    of reasons, including contractual disputes with our supplier or adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier;   

we have reduced control over the pricing of
    third party-supplied materials, and our supplier may be unable or unwilling to supply us with required materials on commercially
    acceptable terms, or at all;   

we have reduced control over the timely delivery
    of third party-supplied materials; and   

our suppliers may be unable to develop technologically
    advanced products to support our growth and development of new systems.   

Disruptions in international
trade and finance or in transportation also may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operation.  Any significant disruption in our operations for any reason, such as regulatory requirements, scheduling
delays, quality control problems, loss of certifications, power interruptions, fires, hurricanes, war or threats of terrorism,
labor strikes, contract disputes, could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships. In addition, in the event of a
breach of law by a vendor based outside of Mexico or a breach of a contractual obligation that has an adverse effect upon our
operations, we may have little or no recourse because all of our vendors  assets could be located in a foreign country,
such as Russia, Italy, Germany, Canada or the People s Republic of China where it may not be possible to effect service
of process and uncertainty exists as to whether the courts in such foreign jurisdiction would recognize or enforce a judgment
of a Mexican court obtained against the vendor. 

We are subject to the economic risk and business cycles
of our merchants and agents and the overall level of consumer spending.   

The payment services
industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect
consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits. Economic factors
such as employment levels, business conditions, energy and fuel costs, interest rates, and inflation rate could reduce consumer
spending or change consumer purchasing habits. A reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our
revenue and profits. If our merchants make fewer sales of their products and services using our services or consumers spend less
money per transaction, we will have fewer transactions to process at lower amounts, resulting in lower revenue. Weakening in the
Mexican economy could have a negative impact on our merchants, as well as consumers who purchase products and services using our
payment processing systems, which could, in turn, negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations,
particularly if the recessionary environment disproportionately affects some of the market segments that represent a larger portion
of our payment processing volume. In addition, these factors could force some of our merchants and/or agents to liquidate their
operations or go bankrupt, or could cause our agents to reduce the number of their locations or hours of operation, resulting
in reduced transaction volumes. We also have a certain amount of fixed costs, including salaries and rent, which could limit our
ability to adjust costs and respond quickly to changes affecting the economy and our business. 

We do not control the rates of the fees levied by Qpagos
Corporation s agents on consumers.   

Qpagos Corporation s
agents pay it an agreed fee using a portion of the fees levied by them on consumers. The fee paid to Qpagos Corporation by the
agent is based on a percentage of the value of each transaction that Qpagos Corporation s processes or a fixed rate per
transaction. However, in most cases the amount of fees levied by an agent on a consumer for each particular transaction is determined
by such agent at its own discretion. Qpagos Corporation usually does not cap the amount of such fees or otherwise control it.
We believe that the fees set by agents are market-driven, and that our interests and Qpagos Corporation s agents 
interests are aligned with a view to maintaining fees at a level that would simultaneously result in our agents  profitability
and customer satisfaction. However, we can provide no assurance that agents will not raise fees to a level that will adversely
affect the popularity of our services among consumers. At the same time, if Qpagos Corporation is forced to cap customer fees
to protect the strength of our brand or otherwise, it may lose a significant number of agents, which would reduce the penetration
of our physical distribution network. In limited instances, we have introduced such caps at the request of our merchants. No assurance
can be made that this trend will not increase. Material increases in customer fees by our agents or the imposition of caps on
the rates of such fees by us could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. 

9  

If consumer confidence in our business deteriorates,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.   

Our business is built
on consumers  confidence in our brands, as well as our ability to provide fast, reliable payment services. As a consumer
business, the strength of our brand and reputation are of paramount importance to us. A number of factors could adversely affect
consumer confidence in our brand, many of which are beyond our control, and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
These factors include: 

any regulatory action or investigation against
    us;   

any significant interruption to our systems
    and operations; and   

any breach of our security system or any compromises
    of consumer data.   

In addition, we are
largely dependent on our agents and, in the future, will be dependent, on franchisees to which we license our products to maintain
the reputation of our brand. Despite the measures that we put in place to ensure their compliance with our performance standards,
our lack of control over their operations may result in the low quality of service of a particular agent or franchisee being attributed
to our brand, negatively affecting our overall reputation. Furthermore, negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our
agents and/or merchants are implicated in fraudulent transactions, irrespective of the accuracy of such publicity or its connection
with our current operations or business, could harm our reputation. Any event that hurts our brand and reputation among consumers
as a reliable payment services provider could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

A decline in the use of cash as
a means of payment may result in a decline in the use of our kiosks and terminals.   

Substantially all
of our operations are in Mexico where a substantial part of the population relies on cash payments rather than credit and debit
card payments or electronic banking. We believe that consumers making cash payments are more likely to use our kiosks and terminals
than where alternative payment methods are available. As a result, we believe that our profitability depends on the use of cash
as a means of payment. There can be no assurance that over time, the prevalence of cash payments in Mexico will not decline as
a greater percentage of the population adopts credit and debit card payments and electronic banking. The shift from cash payments
to credit and debit card payments and electronic banking could reduce our market share and payment volumes and may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our business operations are geographically
concentrated and could be significantly affected by any adverse change in the regions in which we operate.   

Our business operations
are located substantially in Mexico. While Qpagos Corporation recently invested in a company performing similar services in the
United States and we may expand our business to new geographic regions, we are and will continue to still be highly concentrated
in Mexico. Because to date we derive all of our total revenues from our operations in Mexico and expect to continue to derive
a significant portion of our revenue from operations in Mexico for the near future, our business is exposed to adverse regulatory
and competitive changes, economic downturns and changes in political conditions in Mexico. Moreover, due to the concentration
of our businesses in Mexico, our business is less diversified and, accordingly, is subject to greater regional risks than some
of our competitors. 

We are not currently subject to
extensive government regulation; however, we could be subject to extensive government regulation, and there can be no guarantee
that new regulations applicable to our business will not be enacted.   

Currently our business
is not impacted by government regulation; however, we may be subject to a variety of regulations aimed at preventing money laundering
and financing criminal activity and terrorism, financial services regulations, payment services regulations, consumer protection
laws, currency control regulations, advertising laws and privacy and data protection laws and therefore experience periodic investigations
by various regulatory authorities in connection with the same, which may sometimes result in monetary or other sanctions being
imposed on us. Many of these laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and are often unclear and inconsistent with other applicable
laws and regulations making compliance challenging and increasing our related operating costs and legal risks. In particular,
there has been increased public attention and heightened legislation and regulations regarding money laundering and terrorist
financing. We may have to make significant judgment calls in applying anti-money laundering legislation and risk being found in
non-compliance with such laws. 

If local authorities
in Mexico choose to enforce specific interpretations of the applicable legislation that differ from ours or enact new laws, we
may be found to be in violation and subject to penalties or other liabilities. This could also limit our ability in effecting
such payments going forward and may increase our cost of doing business. 

10  

In addition, there
is significant uncertainty regarding future legislation on taxation of electronic payments in Mexico, including the place of taxation.
Subsequent legislation and regulation and interpretations thereof, litigation, court rulings, or other events could expose us
to increased costs, liability and reputational damage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

We may not be able to complete or integrate successfully
any potential future acquisitions, partnerships or joint ventures.   

From time-to-time,
we may evaluate possible acquisition transactions, partnerships or joint ventures, some of which may be material. Potential future
acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures may pose significant risks to our existing operations if they cannot be successfully
integrated. These projects would place additional demands on our managerial, operational, financial and other resources, create
operational complexity requiring additional personnel and other resources and require enhanced control procedures. In addition,
we may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any businesses, services or technologies that we acquire or with which
we form a partnership or joint venture. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition may divert management s time and
resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. Moreover, even if we were successful in integrating newly acquired
assets, expected synergies or cost savings may not materialize, resulting in lower than expected benefits to us from such transactions.
We may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue. Additionally, when making acquisitions it may not be
possible for us to conduct a detailed investigation of the nature of the assets being acquired due to, for instance, time constraints
in making the decision and other factors. We may become responsible for additional liabilities or obligations not foreseen at
the time of an acquisition. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions, we must comply with various antitrust requirements.
It is possible that perceived or actual violations of these requirements could give rise to regulatory enforcement action or result
in us not receiving all necessary approvals in order to complete a desired acquisition. To the extent we pay the purchase price
of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it
could be dilutive to our stockholders. To the extent we pay the purchase price with proceeds from the incurrence of debt, it would
increase our level of indebtedness and could negatively affect our liquidity and restrict our operations. All of the above risks
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. 

As our business develops we will need to implement enhanced
compliance processes, procedures and controls with respect to the rules and regulations that apply to our business.   

Our success requires
significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing payment volumes and amounts of consumer funds, as well
as comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to manage consumer funds or to comply with applicable regulatory
requirements could result in the imposition of fines, harm our reputation and significantly diminish use of our products. In addition,
if we are not in compliance with anti-corruption laws and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities
and/or officials (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which
could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

If we cannot keep pace with rapid
developments and change in our industry and provide new services to our clients, the use of our services could decline, reducing
our revenues.   

The payment services
industry in which we operate is characterized by rapid technological change, new product and service introductions, evolving industry
standards, changing customer needs and the entrance of more established market players seeking to expand into these businesses.
In order to remain competitive, we continually seek to expand the services we offer and to develop new projects, including, for
example, the electronic wallet. These projects carry risks, such as delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of customer
acceptance. In our industry, these risks are acute. Any delay in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate
our services or to accurately predict and address market demand could render our services less desirable, or even obsolete, to
consumers. In addition, if alternative payment mechanisms become widely available, substituting our current products and services,
and we do not develop and offer similar alternative payment mechanisms successfully and on a timely basis, our business and prospects
could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new services. Our
development efforts could result in increased costs and we could also experience a loss in business that could reduce our earnings
or could cause a loss of revenue if promised new services are not timely delivered to our clients, are not able to compete effectively
with our competitors  or do not perform as anticipated. If we are unable to develop, adapt to or access technological changes
or evolving industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected. 

11  

Our systems and our third party
providers  systems may fail due to factors beyond our control, which could interrupt our service, cause us to lose business
and increase our costs.   

We depend on the efficient
and uninterrupted operation of numerous systems, including our computer systems, software and telecommunications networks, as
well as the data centers that we lease from third parties. We only have one data center in central Mexico that controls our operations
and hosts our main equipment. Our systems and operations, or those of our third party providers, could be exposed to damage or
interruption from, among other things, fire, flood, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, vendor failure,
unauthorized entry, improper operation and computer viruses. Substantial property and equipment loss, and disruption in operations,
as well as any defects in our systems or those of third parties or other difficulties could expose us to liability and materially
adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any outage or disruptive efforts to
our data center would result in the failure of our computers and kiosks to operate and would, if for an extensive period of time,
adversely impact our reputation, brand and future prospects. 

Unauthorized disclosure of data,
whether through cybersecurity breaches, computer viruses or otherwise, could expose us to liability, protracted and costly litigation
and damage our reputation.   

We store and/or transmit
sensitive data, such as mobile phone numbers, and we have ultimate liability to our consumers for our failure to protect this
data. If breaches occur our encryption of data and other protective measures may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of data.
Unauthorized disclosure of data or a cybersecurity breach could harm our reputation and deter clients from using electronic payments
as well as kiosks and terminals generally and our services specifically, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the
breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, result
in the imposition of material penalties and fines by state authorities and otherwise materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Customer complaints or negative
publicity about our customer service could affect attractiveness of our services adversely and, as a result, could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   

Customer complaints
or negative publicity about our customer service could diminish consumer confidence in, and the attractiveness of, our services.
Breaches of our consumers  privacy and our security systems could have the same effect. We sometimes take measures to combat
risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security, such as freezing consumer funds, which could damage relations with our consumers.
These measures heighten the need for prompt and attentive customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes. Effective customer
service requires significant personnel expense, and this expense, if not managed properly, could impact our profitability significantly.
Any inability by us to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer
complaints effectively. If we do not handle customer complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer, and we may lose our customers 
confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Qpagos Corporation s agreements
with our agents and our merchants do not include exclusivity clauses and may be terminated unilaterally at any time or upon short
notice.   

Qpagos Corporation
normally does not include exclusivity clauses in its agreements with agents or merchants, which is standard in the payment services
industry. Accordingly, merchants and agents do not have any restrictions on dealings with other providers and can switch from
Qpagos Corporation s payment processing system to another without significant investment. The termination of contracts with
existing agents or merchants or a significant decline in the amount of business we do with them as a result of contracts not having
exclusivity clauses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our payment system might be used
for fraudulent, illegal or improper purposes, which could expose us to additional liability and harm our business.   

Despite measures we
have taken and continue to take, our payment system remains susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses. These may include
use of our payment services in connection with fraudulent sales of goods or services, illicit sales of prescription medications
or controlled substances, software and other intellectual property piracy, money laundering, bank fraud and prohibited sales of
restricted products. In the past there have been news articles on how organized crime groups have used other payment services
to transfer money in the course of illegal transactions. 

Criminals are using
increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud. It is possible that incidents
of fraud could increase in the future. Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify, monitor
and manage these risks. We are not able to monitor in each case the sources for our counterparties  funds or the ways in
which they use them. Increases in chargebacks or other liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Furthermore, an increase in fraudulent transactions or publicity regarding chargeback disputes
could harm our reputation and reduce consumer confidence in the use of our kiosks and electronic wallets. 

12  

We are subject to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates.   

We are exposed to
currency risks. Our financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars, while its revenues and expenses are in Mexican pesos.
Accordingly, its results of operations and assets and liabilities are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and the Mexican peso. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates also affect the carrying value of assets on the balance
sheet, which may result in a decline in the dollar amount of our total assets on the balance sheet. During the year ended December
31, 2015, we incurred a foreign currency loss of ($ 466,920) attributable to the deterioration of the Mexican Peso against the
US Dollar. However, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a foreign currency loss of $(216,699). 

We may not be able to successfully
protect the intellectual property we license and may be subject to infringement claims.   

We rely on a combination
of contractual rights, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We customarily
require our employees and independent contractors to execute confidentiality agreements or otherwise to agree to keep our proprietary
information confidential when their relationship with us begins. Typically, our employment contracts also include clauses requiring
our employees to assign to us all of the inventions and intellectual property rights they develop in the course of their employment
and to agree not to disclose our confidential information. Nevertheless, others, including our competitors, may independently
develop similar technology to that licensed by us, duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property. Further,
contractual arrangements may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information or ensure an adequate remedy
in the event of any unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information. Because of the limited protection and enforcement
of intellectual property rights in Mexico, our intellectual property rights may not be as protected as they may be in more developed
markets such as the United States. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope or enforceability of our intellectual
property rights (including trade secrets and know-how), which could be expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may
not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete and could result
in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain service offerings or other competitive harm. Additionally, we do not hold
any patents for our business model or our business processes, and we do not currently intend to obtain any such patents in Mexico,
the United States or elsewhere. 

We may also be subject
to costly litigation in the event our services or the technology that we license are claimed to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise
violate any third party s intellectual property or proprietary rights. Such claims could include patent infringement, copyright
infringement, trademark infringement, trade secret misappropriation or breach of licenses. We may not be able to successfully
defend against such claims, which may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these
claims and also might require us to redesign affected services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly
damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our services. In
such circumstances, if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology
from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted. Additionally, in recent years, non-practicing entities
have been acquiring patents, making claims of patent infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies in our
industry. Even if we believe that such claims are without merit and successfully defend these claims, defending against such claims
is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees. 

We may use open source software in a manner that could
be harmful to our business.   

We use open source
software in connection with our technology and services. The original developers of the open source code provide no warranties
on such code. Moreover, some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their
software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the
open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The use of such open source code may ultimately require us to replace certain
code used in our products, pay a royalty to use some open source code or discontinue certain products. Any of the above requirements
could be harmful to our business, financial condition and operations. 

We do not have and may be unable to obtain sufficient
insurance to protect ourselves from business risks.   

The insurance industry
in Mexico is not yet fully developed, and many forms of insurance protection common in more developed countries are not yet fully
available or are not available on comparable or commercially acceptable terms. Accordingly, while we hold certain mandatory types
of insurance policies, we do not currently maintain insurance coverage for business interruption, property damage or loss of key
management personnel, as we have been unable to obtain these on commercially acceptable terms. We do not hold insurance policies
to cover for any losses resulting from counterparty and credit risks or fraudulent transactions. We also do not generally maintain
separate funds or otherwise set aside reserves for most types of business-related risks. Accordingly, our lack of insurance coverage
or reserves with respect to business-related risks may expose us to substantial losses, which could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

13  

In a dynamic industry like ours, the ability to attract,
recruit, retain and develop qualified personnel is critical to our success and growth.   

Our business functions
at the intersection of rapidly changing technological, social, economic and regulatory developments that require a wide ranging
set of expertise and intellectual capital. In order for us to compete and grow successfully, we must attract, recruit, retain
and develop the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of our capital needs. This
is particularly true with respect to qualified and experienced software engineers and IT staff, who are highly sought after and
are not in sufficient supply in Mexico. The market for such personnel is highly competitive, and we may not succeed in recruiting
additional personnel or may fail to replace effectively current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Our
efforts to retain and develop personnel may result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract
key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

If we cannot establish profitable
operations, we will need to raise additional capital to fully implement our business plan, which may not be available on commercially
reasonable terms, or at all, and which may dilute your investment.   

Achieving and sustaining
profitability will require us to increase our revenues and manage our operating and administrative expenses. We cannot guarantee
that we will be successful in achieving profitability. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to pay our expenses and
our existing sources of cash and cash flows are otherwise insufficient to fund our activities, we will need to raise additional
funds to continue our operations and in order to fully implement our business plan. To date, we have raised an aggregate of $7,115,187
from the sale of debt and equity securities. We estimate that we will need approximately $3,000,000 to implement our current business
plan and repay our outstanding debt. If we do not generate such revenue from operations, we may be forced to limit our expansion.
Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders, may experience dilution,
and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders.
If we are unsuccessful in achieving profitability, and we cannot obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at
all, we may be required to curtail significantly or cease its operations, which could result in the loss to investors of their
investment in our securities. 

The substantial share ownership
position of ten of our largest stockholders may limit your ability to influence corporate matters.   

As of the date of
this Quarterly Report, 10 stockholders own 32,080,199 shares of our Common Stock, representing approximately 58% of the voting
power of our issued share capital. As a result of this concentration of share ownership, the 10 stockholders have sole discretion
over certain matters submitted to our stockholders for approval that require a simple majority vote and has significant voting
power on all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval that require a qualified majority vote, including the power to
veto them. This concentration of ownership could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination, which
could negatively impact the value of our shares. The interests of these 10 stockholders may not always coincide with the interests
of our other stockholders. 

Certain of our officers may have a conflict of interest.   

Certain of our officers are currently working
for our Company on a part-time basis. One such officer also works at other jobs and has discretion to decide what time he devotes
to our activities, which may result in a lack of availability when needed due to responsibilities at other jobs. 

Risks Relating to  Doing Business in  Mexico  

Emerging markets, such as Mexico,
are subject to greater risks than more developed markets, including significant legal, economic and political risks.   

Investors in emerging
markets, such as Mexico, should be aware that these markets are subject to greater risk than more developed markets, including
in some cases significant legal, economic and political risks. Investors should also note that emerging economies are subject
to rapid change and that the information set out herein may become outdated relatively quickly. Accordingly, investors should
exercise particular care in evaluating the risks involved and must decide for themselves whether, in light of those risks, their
investment is appropriate. Generally, investment in emerging markets is only suitable for sophisticated investors who fully appreciate
the significance of the risks involved, and investors are urged to consult with their own legal and financial advisors before
making an investment in our securities. 

14  

Mexican federal governmental policies
or regulations, as well as economic, political and social developments in Mexico, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.   

Substantially all
of our assets and operations are located in Mexico. As a result, we are subject to political, legal and regulatory risks specific
to Mexico, which can have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Mexican federal
government has exercised, and continues to exercise, significant influence over the Mexican economy. Accordingly, Mexican federal
governmental actions, fiscal and monetary policy could have an impact on Mexican private sector entities, including our Company,
and on market conditions. We cannot predict the impact that political conditions will have on the Mexican economy. Furthermore,
our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be affected by currency fluctuations, price instability,
inflation, interest rates, regulation, taxation, social instability and other political, social and economic developments in or
affecting Mexico, over which we have no control. We cannot assure potential investors that changes in Mexican federal governmental
policies will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Mexico has recently
experienced periods of violence and crime due to the activities of drug cartels. In response, the Mexican government has implemented
various security measures and has strengthened its police and military forces. Despite these efforts, drug-related crime continues
to exist in Mexico. These activities, their possible escalation and the violence associated with them may have a negative impact
on the Mexican economy or on our operations in the future. The social and political situation in Mexico could adversely affect
the Mexican economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.   

We currently offer
our services in Mexico and therefore our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: 

trade restrictions and changes in tariffs;   

the impact of business
    cycles and downturns in economies outside of the United States;   

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements
    that may limit its ability to export its products or sell into particular jurisdictions;   

import and export license requirements and restrictions;   

difficulties in maintaining effective communications
    with employees and customers due to distance, language and cultural barriers;   

disruptions in international transport or delivery;   

difficulties in protecting our intellectual
    property rights, particularly in countries where the laws and practices do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent
    as do the laws and practices of the United States;   

difficulties in enforcing agreements through
    non-U.S. legal systems;   

longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting
    receivables; and   

potentially adverse tax consequences.   

If any of these risks
materialize, our operations could suffer. 

Risks Relating to our Securities  

There is currently a limited public
trading market for our common stock and one may never develop  . 

There currently is
a limited public trading market for our securities, and it is not assured that any such public market will develop in the foreseeable
future. While this is true of any small cap company, the fact that one of our services are provided solely in Mexico, may make
the path to a listing on an exchange or actively traded in the over-the-counter market more problematic. Moreover, there can be
no assurance that even if our common stock is approved for listing on an exchange or is quoted in the over-the-counter market
in the future, that an active trading market will develop or be sustained. Therefore, we cannot predict the prices at which our
common stock will trade in the future, if at all. As a result, our investors may have limited or no ability to liquidate their
investments. 

15  

Trading in our common
stock is conducted on the OTCQB, as we currently do not meet the initial listing criteria for any registered securities exchange.  The
OTCQB and OTC Markets are less recognized markets than the registered securities exchanges and is often characterized by low trading
volume and significant price fluctuations.  These and other factors may further impair our stockholders  ability
to sell their shares when they want to and/or could depress our stock price. As a result, stockholders could find it difficult
to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations of the price of our securities because smaller quantities of shares could be bought
and sold, transactions could be delayed and security analyst and news coverage of our Company may be limited.  If a
public market for our common stock does develop, these factors could 

The market price of our common stock
may be highly volatile and such volatility could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.   

The market price of
our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as: 

the announcement of new products or product
    enhancements by us or our competitors;   

developments concerning intellectual property
    rights;   

changes in legal, regulatory, and enforcement
    frameworks impacting our services;   

variations in our and our competitors 
    results of operations;   

fluctuations in earnings estimates or recommendations
    by securities analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts;   

the results of intellectual property lawsuits;   

future issuances of common stock or other securities;   

the addition or departure of key personnel;
    and   

general market conditions and other factors,
    including factors unrelated to our operating performance.   

Further, the stock
market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The volatility of our common stock could be further exacerbated
due to low trading volume. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock,
which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock and the loss of some or all of our investors  investment. 

Some or all of the
 restricted  shares of our common stock held by our stockholders, including, but not limited to, shares issued in
connection with: (i) our incorporation in 2013 and (ii) our 2015 private placements may be offered from time to time in the open
market pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or without registration pursuant to Rule 144
promulgated thereunder, and these sales may have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock. 

Because our common stock may be
a  penny stock,  it may be more difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock, and the market price of
our common stock may be adversely affected.   

Our common stock may
be a  penny stock  if, among other things, the stock price is below $5.00 per share, it is not listed on a national
securities exchange, or it has not met certain net tangible asset or average revenue requirements. Broker-dealers who sell penny
stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the SEC. This risk-disclosure
document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny-stock market.
A broker must also give a purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson
compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and obtain the purchaser s
written agreement to the purchase. Broker-dealers must also provide customers that hold penny stock in their accounts with such
broker-dealer a monthly statement containing price and market information relating to the penny stock. If a penny stock is sold
to an investor in violation of the penny stock rules, the investor may be able to cancel its purchase and get their money back. 

If applicable, the
penny stock rules may make it difficult for stockholders to sell their shares of our common stock. Because of the rules and restrictions
applicable to a penny stock, there is less trading in penny stocks and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.
Also, many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions. Accordingly, stockholders may not always be able to
resell their shares of our common stock publicly at times and prices that they feel are appropriate. 

16  

Because we became public by means
of a reverse Merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of brokerage firms   . 

Additional risks may
exist because we became public through a  Reverse Merger.  Securities analysts of brokerage firms may not provide
coverage of our Company since there is little incentive for brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No
assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct secondary offerings on our behalf in the future. 

Compliance with the reporting requirements
of federal securities laws can be expensive.   

We are a public reporting
company in the United States, and accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other
federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The costs of preparing and filing
annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders are substantial. If
we do not provide current information about our Company to market makers, they will not be able to trade our stock. Failure to
comply with the applicable securities laws could result in private or governmental legal action against us or our officers and
directors, which could have a detrimental impact on our business and financials, the value of our stock, and the ability of stockholders
to resell their stock. 

Our investors  ownership may
be diluted in the future.   

In the future, we
may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of ownership interests of
our present stockholders. We expect to need to issue a substantial number of shares of common stock or other securities convertible
into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, raising additional
capital in the future to fund our operations, and other business purposes. Additional shares of common stock issued by us in the
future, including shares issued upon exercise of the warrants, will dilute an investor s investment in the Company. 

Directors, executive officers, principal
stockholders and affiliated entities own a significant percentage of our capital stock, and they may make decisions that our stockholders
do not consider to be in their best interests  . 

As of the date of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliated entities beneficially
own, in the aggregate, approximately 71% of our outstanding voting securities as of the date hereof. As a result, if some or all
of them acted together, they would have the ability to exert substantial influence over the election of our board of directors
and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of
delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company that may be favored by other stockholders. This could prevent transactions
in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices. This concentration of ownership
and influence in management and board decision-making could also harm the price of our capital stock by, among other things, discouraging
a potential acquirer from seeking to acquire shares of our capital stock (whether by making a tender offer or otherwise) or otherwise
attempting to obtain control of our Company. 

Our board of directors has historically
had significant control over us and we have yet to establish committees comprised of independent directors  . 

We only have three
directors. Because of such limited number of directors, each of our board members had significant control over all corporate issues.
In addition, two of our three directors also held officer positions in Qpagos Corporation. The third director is the manager of
an entity that provides consulting services to us. We could not establish board committees comprised of independent members, and
we did not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors. Our three directors performed these functions,
despite not all being independent directors. Thus, there was potential conflict in that two of our directors were also engaged
in management and participated in decisions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management and
our performance. 

We have identified material weaknesses
in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional
material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic
reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to
a decline in our stock price.   

Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act. We have historically operated as a private company and the number and qualifications of our finance and
accounting staff have not been consistent with those of a public company. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal
controls with respect to our segregation of duties and review and accounting of certain complex transactions. 

We have restated out consolidated financial
statements as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.   

We have begun
to take actions that we believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified. In response to the identification
of our material weaknesses, we: (i) have retained a part-time Chief Financial Officer to segregate the duties of Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer; (ii) are in the process of establishing a review process for key aspects of our financial
reporting process, including the accounting for complex transactions; (iii) expanding our finance and accounting staff and (iv)
will seek to establish better operating controls and involve our board of directors in our internal controls process, which will
involve establishing formal procedures to communicate deficiencies in internal controls on a timely basis, and encourage our board
of directors to more actively participate in guiding management as it relates to internal controls matters. However, we cannot
assure you that our internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses
in the future. Regardless, following the completion of this offering we will be required to expend time and resources to further
improve our internal controls over financial reporting, including by expanding our finance and accounting staff.

Investors in our Common Stock may
have limited recourse against us, our directors and executive officers because we conduct our operations outside the United States
and our current directors and executive officers reside outside the United States.   

Our presence outside
the United States may limit investors  legal recourse against us. Our operating subsidiaries are incorporated under the
laws of Mexico and all of our current directors and senior officers reside outside the United States, principally in Mexico. Substantially
all of our assets and the assets of our current directors and executive officers are located outside the United States, principally
in Mexico. As a result, investors may not be able to effect service of process within the United States upon our Company or its
directors and executive officers or to enforce U.S. court judgments obtained against our Company or its directors and executive
officers in Mexico or other jurisdictions outside the United States, including actions under the civil liability provisions of
U.S. securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions
outside the United States, liabilities predicated upon U.S. securities laws. 

We do not expect to pay dividends
on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future.   

We do not expect to
pay dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay dividends.  Consequently, the only
opportunity for investors to achieve a return on their investment may be if a trading market develops, and investors are able
to sell their shares for a profit or if our business is sold at a price that enables investors to recognize a profit, neither
of which we can guarantee will ever take place. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of
Directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to our financial condition, operating results,
cash needs, and growth plans. 

We do not have an independent compensation
committee, which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to those executive officers who are board members and other
officers may not be commensurate with its financial performance.   

A compensation committee
consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by company executives. Our board of directors, is comprised
of two executive officers and one other director, and absent an independent compensation committee currently determines the compensation
and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans, and reviews policies relating to the
compensation and benefits of our employees Our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive
officers on the board may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with
its financial performance. 

Limitations on director and officer liability and indemnification
of our officers and directors by it may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against an officer or director.   

Our certificate of
incorporation and by-laws provide, with certain exceptions as permitted by Nevada law, that a director or officer shall not be
personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, unless the director or officer
committed both a breach of fiduciary duty and such breach was accompanied by intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation
of law. These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director or officer for breach of fiduciary
duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on behalf of us against a director or officer. 

We are responsible for the indemnification
of our officers and directors.   

Should our officers
and/or directors require us to contribute to their defense in an action brought against them in their capacity as such, we may
be required to spend significant amounts of our capital. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws also provide for the indemnification
of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against attorney's fees and other expenses incurred
by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on behalf of us. This
indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup. If these expenditures are significant,
or involve issues which result in significant liability for our key personnel, we may be unable to continue operating as a going
concern. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds for the Nine months ended September 30, 2016  

During July 2016, we sold an aggregate
of 140,000 shares of common stock to a certain investor for gross proceeds of $105,000. The issuances of the common stock were
made in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for the offer and sale of securities not involving
a public offering. The recipients of securities in each of these transactions acquired the securities for investment only and
not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were affixed to the securities
issued in these transactions. Each of the recipients of securities in these transactions was an accredited investor within the
meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act and had adequate access, through employment, business or other relationships,
to information about us.
