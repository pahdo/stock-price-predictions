  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

Microphase Corporation (the  Company )
is a design to manufacture original equipment manufacturer (OEM) industry leader delivering world-class radio frequency (RF) and
microwave filters, diplexers, multiplexers, detectors, switch filters, integrated assemblies and detector logarithmic video amplifiers
(DLVA) to the military, aerospace and telecommunications industries. Sales to military markets represent 100% of sales. The Company
is headquartered in Shelton, Connecticut. 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information
and pursuant to the regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for
the three months ending September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full fiscal
year. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries
which include Microphase West LLC and Microphase Instruments, LLC, as of October 23, 2015. All intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. 

For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30,
2016. As of June 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $13,939,651 and a total stockholders  deficit of $602,207. As
of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $14,605,924 and a total stockholders  deficit of $940,313. A significant
amount of capital will be necessary to sustain, grow and advance our business and these conditions raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern, as expressed in the report of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for
the year ended June 30, 2016. 

The Company s ability to continue
as a going concern and its future success is dependent upon its ability to raise capital in the near term to: (1) satisfy its current
obligations, (2) continue its research and development efforts, and (3) allow the successful wide scale development, deployment
and marketing of its products. 

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   Are
stated at cost. Provision for depreciation and amortization for financial reporting and income tax purposes is made by annual charges
to operations principally under the following methods and estimated useful lives:

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS
  Charged to expenses as incurred. Cost of major replacements and renewals are capitalized. Upon retirement or
other disposition of equipment and improvements, the cost and related depreciation is removed from the accounts, and any gain
or loss is recognized in income. 

INVENTORIES   are stated
at the lower of average cost or market under the first-in, first-out method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities
on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand,
anticipated end of product life and production requirements. 

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (  continued  )  

OTHER LONG LIVED ASSETS   The
Company reviews long-term assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets
may not be recoverable. The Company assesses these assets for impairment based on their future cash flows. Management has determined
that there was no impairment charge to be recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE   Management
records receivables at net realizable value and they generally do not bear interest. This value includes an allowance for estimated
uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances which is charged to the provision for
doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs, level of past due accounts and economic status
of the customers. We consider a receivable delinquent if it is unpaid after 180 days after it is due. 

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES   Management
uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those
estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities,
and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing the financial
statements. 

COMPENSATED ABSENCES   Employees
of the Company are entitled to vacation pay depending on length of service and current salary. Vacation days accrued in a given
year are available in the following year. A limit of 5 days of unused vacation may be carried over to a subsequent year. The Company
has provided for vacation liabilities in the accompanying financial statements. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES   The
Company charges the cost of research and development to operations when incurred. 

REVENUE
RECOGNITION   The Company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been
shipped, the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured.  Revenue is recognized net of estimated sales
returns and allowances. 

GRANT INCOME  
During the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company was awarded and received the proceeds of a Small Business Express
Matching Grant in an amount of $100,000 from the state of Connecticut in connection with the move of our California operation to
Connecticut and with the development of the T   M products to be acquired in the Company s Microphase Instruments, LLC,
subsidiary. State grant funding requires a dollar for dollar match on behalf of the Company, which the Company s obligation
was considered funded in full prior to the Grant award. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded $26,800
as a reduction in Selling, General   Administrative expenses for qualified expenditures incurred in the period and at September
30, 2016 has included $73,200 in deferred revenue. Qualified expenditures for capital assets will be recognized as income over
the life of the assets based upon the amortization or depreciation of any capitalized assets acquired with grant funds. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS-
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to current year
classifications 

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (  continued  )  

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE   Basic
earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) is determined by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number
of shares of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted
average number of common shares used in the basic EPS calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming
conversion of all potentially dilutive securities (such as stock options, preferred stock and convertible securities) outstanding
under the treasury stock method. As of September 30, 2016 we have outstanding (i) options to purchase 75,000 shares, (ii) 15,382
shares of preferred stock convertible into 1,025,467 shares, and (iii) $479,129 of debts to related parties convertible into 312,420
shares of our Common stock. In periods reporting a loss the inclusion of warrants and potential common shares to be issued in connection
with convertible debt have an anti-dilutive effect on diluted loss per share and have been omitted in such computation. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  The
Company is evaluating several pronouncements issued by the FASB which may result in the adoption by the Company of these standards
in upcoming accounting periods as follows: 

ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   

On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of
Debt Issuance Costs, which requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. The guidance in Update 2015-03 (see below) does not address presentation
or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance
within Update 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity
deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably
over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit
arrangement to be effective for Fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015;
which for us is 1 st  interim period of fiscal 2017, or the current quarter ended September 30 2016. The adoption of
this standard had no material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

ASU 2014-12   Compensation Stock-Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share Based Payments When
the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (a consensus of the
FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) to be effective for Annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015; which for us would be our 1 st  interim period of fiscal 2017, or the
current quarter ended September 30 2016.  The adoption of this standard had no material effect on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows. 

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET
EFFECTIVE   

The Company is evaluating several pronouncements
issued by the FASB which may result in the adoption by the Company of these standards in upcoming accounting periods as follows: 

ASU 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Deferral of the Effective Date-In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes
nearly all revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP and supersedes some cost guidance for construction-type and production-type
contracts. The guidance in this standard is principles-based, and accordingly, entities will be required to use more judgment and
make more estimates than under prior guidance, including identifying contract performance obligations, estimating variable consideration
to include in the contract price and allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations. 

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (  continued  )  

The guidance in this standard is applicable
to all contracts with customers, regardless of industry-specific or transaction-specific fact patterns. Additionally, this standard
provides guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (e.g., service revenue, contract modifications
and licenses of intellectual property) and modifies guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The core principle of this standard
is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To help financial statement
users better understand the nature, amount, timing and potential uncertainty of the revenue that is recognized, this standard requires
significantly more interim and annual disclosures. This standard allows for either  full retrospective  adoption (application
to all periods presented) or  modified retrospective  adoption (application to only the most current period presented
in the financial statements, as well as certain additional required footnote disclosures). On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a
one-year deferral of the effective date, while permitting entities to elect to adopt one year earlier on the original effective
date. As a result, this standard is now effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2017, which for us is our fiscal 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard, if any, will have
on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

ASU 2015-11   Inventory
(Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. For public business entities, the content that links to this paragraph shall
be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which for
us is our first quarter of fiscal 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. 

ASU 2016-02   In February 2016, the FASB issued a new
lease standard that supersedes existing lease guidance under GAAP. This standard requires lessees to record most leases on their
balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to existing lease guidance under GAAP. Entities
are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest
comparative period in the financial statements, with the option to use certain relief. Full retrospective application is prohibited.
This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018,
which for us is our fiscal 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows. 

ASU 2014-15   Presentation
of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 20540): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern to be effective for Annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016; which for us would be our fiscal 2017 and although early adoption is permitted for this standard,
the Company has not adopted nor determined its applicability. 

ASU 2016-09   In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting
standards update making final targeted amendments to the accounting for employee share-based payments. These amendments will require
entities to recognize the income tax effects of awards when the awards vest or are settled, will change an employer s accounting
for an employee s use of shares to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation and will require
entities to elect whether to account for forfeitures of share-based payments by either recognizing forfeitures of awards as they
occur or estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited as is currently required. The required method of adoption varies
by amendment. This accounting standards update is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2016, which for us is our first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted in any annual
or interim period, but all of the guidance is required to be adopted in the same period and any adjustments must be reflected as
of the beginning of the fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact this accounting standards update will have on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. 

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (  continued  )  

ASU 2015-17   Deferred
Taxes (topic 740): For a particular tax-paying component of an entity and within a particular tax jurisdiction, all current deferred
tax liabilities and assets shall be offset and presented as a single amount and all noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and assets,
as well as any related valuation allowance, shall be offset and presented as a single noncurrent amount. However, an entity shall
not offset deferred tax liabilities and assets attributable to different tax-paying components of the entity or to different tax
jurisdictions. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is our first quarter
of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted in any annual or interim period, but all of the guidance is required to be adopted
in the same period and any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the
impact this accounting standards update will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

ASU 2016-15  The
FASB recently issued ASU 2016-15 to clarify whether the certain items should be categorized as operating, investing
or financing in the statement of cash flows.  For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for
financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
which for us is our fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted in any annual or interim period, but all of the guidance is required
to be adopted in the same period and any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year. We are currently
evaluating the impact this accounting standards update will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

NOTE 2   SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION  

NOTE 3   INVENTORIES  

Inventories consist of the following:  

In August 2016, Microphase West operations were transferred
to the Shelton Connecticut plant. As of September 30, 2016 Microphase West inventory was combined with the Shelton Connecticut
inventory. The inventory reserves were similarly combined to equal $37,000 for September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 4   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:  

Property and equipment was comprised of the following:  

Depreciation expense was $17,994 and $19,389
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 5   ACCRUED EXPENSES:  

Accrued expenses were comprised of the
following:  

401 (K) Employee Benefit Plan:  

The Company sponsors a 401(K) plan for
all eligible employees. Employee contributions are based on a percentage of compensation. Employer contributions for both matching
and profit sharing are discretionary and determined annually by management. 

Deferred Lease Obligation  

At September 30, 2016 the Company has $95,441
of deferred lease obligation associated with the amendment in May of 2016 for its long term lease on the Shelton, Connecticut facility. 

NOTE 6   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  

The fair value of a financial instrument
is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale. Quoted market prices are used to establish fair value when they are available and other valuation techniques
are utilized to estimate the fair value of financial instruments that do not have quoted market prices. 

The Company has long term debt with fixed
interest rates, the carrying amount of which may be different from fair value as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The Company
decided that it is not practical to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments on the basis that they are held-to-maturity
debts which have no immediately available market information on the fair value and the cost of making assumptions and applying
estimation methodologies to assess the fair value estimates exceeds the benefit. Information pertinent to estimating the fair value
such as carrying amount, effective interest rate, maturity and repayment term are disclosed in Notes 7, 8, 9. 

The Company has applied the fair value
concepts to its available-for-sale securities. As such, the valuation techniques used to measure fair value is based on the source
of the data used to develop the prices. The priority of these sources is defined as follows: 

Level 1   quoted prices
in active markets. 

 Level 2   other than quoted
prices that are directly or indirectly observable. 

 Level 3   unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability. 

Marketable securities, classified as
available-for-sale securities, are measured at fair market value (Level 1) on a recurring basis. As of September 30, 2016
these amounted to $385,667. 

NOTE 7   REVOLVING CREDIT LINE

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS   ACQUISITION
NOTES PAYABLE:  

The Company acquired certain assets including
specific inventory and fixed assets from a RF services provider, Microsemi Corp-RF Integrated Solutions ( Microsemi );
which had eliminated providing certain RF services similar to that of the Company for approximately 10 customers. The acquisition
was pursuant to a contract, originally dated March 27, 2013, which provided for a $100,000 down payment and a note payable for
$650,000, with payments through December, 2014 as amended. The total purchase price of $750,000 was allocated to tangible assets
inventory and fixed assets associated with these specific RF services, and $155,277 intangible assets consisting of a customer
list, non-compete clause and an exclusive license. The Contract also provided for 5% royalty on certain RF services we will provide
to the specified 10 customers. 

On August 8, 2014 the Company initially
signed a strategic partnership agreement with Dynamac, Inc. to develop, manufacture and market a portfolio of low cost RF/Microwave
and Millimeter-wave calibrated test probes and related universal test platforms. 

On January 21, 2016, Microphase
Instruments LLC, a subsidiary of Microphase Corporation (the  Company ) entered into a Purchase Agreement (the
 Agreement ) with Dynamac, Inc. (the  Seller ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire
certain assets in a line of proprietary RF and microwave test and measurement products, as well as related intellectual
property (the  Dynamac Assets ). On November 2, 2016, the Company entered into that certain First Amendment to
Purchase Agreement with Dynamac (the  Dynamac Amendment ), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company
agreed that Dynamac would retain ownership of the Dynamac assets until the Company has paid all amounts owed pursuant to the
Dynamac agreement, with such amounts due within 10 days of the closing of the offering of the Company s common stock as
contemplated in the Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on July 28, 2016 (the  Offering ). 

Asset allocation on Acquisition date   

Microsemi   

The Exclusive License associated with the
Microsemi Inc. ( Microsemi ) asset acquisition was valued at $56,861, was ascribed a perpetual life and is subject
to evaluation annually for impairment. Management has determined that there was no impairment charge to be recorded for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Customer Lists and Non-Compete agreements associated with the Microsemi asset acquisition
were ascribed useful lives of 7 and 5 years respectively. The consideration paid for this portion of business was allocated to
the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.
We assigned $155,277 to identifiable intangible assets, which consist of a customer list, non-compete clause and an exclusive license.
The acquired intangible assets will be amortized over their estimate lives, which range from 5 to 10 years, primarily using accelerated
amortization methods based on the cash flow streams used to value those assets. The exclusive license has a contractual indefinite
life and is reviewed annually for impairment. There was no excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net
assets acquired and as such no goodwill was recorded. Amortization expense recorded for these intangible assets was $3,878 and
$3,878 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Dynamac   

The Dynamac License was recorded at cost.
The Company deposited $50,000 and provided a $300,000 note payable toward the initial contract during fiscal 2015 which was subsequently
revised by the Dynamac agreement of January 21, 2016. 

The assets acquired in the Dynamac agreement
of January 21, 2016 have been valued at the contract price in our initial measurement, resulting in intangible assets other than
goodwill, primarily Intellectual Property consisting of two (2) patents with remaining lives of over 12 years each, a portfolio
of product prototypes to be patented, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information and other intellectual property. We expect
to incur additional costs to apply for eighteen (18) new patents, in addition to various trademarks and copyrights. 

Our accounting for the allocation of the
relative fair value of the intangible assets, other than goodwill, acquired in the Dynamac acquisition is still preliminary. The
fair value estimates for the assets acquired were based on preliminary calculations, and our estimates and assumptions of the allocation
of the relative fair value of these assets to possibly amortizable components, and if any, what period of amortization would be
appropriate, are subject to change as we obtain additional information for our estimates during the measurement period (up to one
year from the acquisition date). These assets will be subject to periodic evaluation and at a minimum will be reviewed annually
for impairment. The Company assesses these assets for impairment based on their future cash flows. 

Our Acquisitions have resulted in
the following Asset allocation:   

Asset Acquisition Note Payable is
comprised of the following:   

The acquisition of Microsemi on March 27,
2013, provided for a $100,000 down payment and a note payable for $650,000, with payments through December, 2014 and was paid in
full during Fiscal 2015. 

The Dynamac agreement, as revised, of January
21, 2016 was funded by the $50,000 original deposit paid in connection with the previous agreement, $350,000 paid at closing, $100,000
paid in February 2016, and a series of four $550,000 payments payable on the note semi-annually, due in August 2016   2017
and February 2017   2018. The Company imputed interest at 7%, its most favorable credit line rate, and as such is valued at
$2,020,425. On November 2, 2016 the Agreement was extended whereby the initial payment is due November 22, 2016. See Note 13

Also in October 2016, the Company has offered

ITEM 2.       MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL
CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and
other reports filed by Microphase Corporation (the  Company ) from time to time with the SEC (collectively, the  Filings )
contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available
to, the Company s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company s management. Readers are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof.
When used in the Filings, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect, 
 future,   intend,   plan,  or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they
relate to the Company or the Company s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current
view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including
the risks relating to the Company s business, industry, and the Company s operations and results of operations. Should
one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned. 

Although the Company
believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future
results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws
of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to
actual results. 

Our financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would
not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW  

Microphase Corporation designs and manufactures
custom RF (radio frequency) and microwave products from DC to 40 GHz. Our products include components, subsystems and multi-function
assemblies for the military and commercial markets. The Company has been in business for over 60 years and is one of the oldest
and most established RF and microwave products companies in the industry. 

The Company s RF and microwave products
enable the transmission, reception and processing of high frequency signals in defense electronics, homeland security systems and
telecommunication networks. Our RF products are typically used in high frequency applications and include filters, switch filters,
diplexers, multiplexers, detectors, detector logarithmic video amplifiers (DLVA) and multi-function assemblies. The end products
in which the Company s products are used include fighter planes, missiles, submarines, ships, drones, and IED jammers. Customers
include Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Saab, BAE Systems and the U. S. Government. Sales to the military markets comprised 100% of
sales for 2016 and the first three months of fiscal 2017. 

Many years of deficit spending have caused
U.S. Government budgets to come under significant pressure in recent years. In particular, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted
in automatic spending reductions known as sequestration, through budget caps for both defense and non-defense spending. According
to  usgovernmentspending.com  spending on Military Defense has gone from $693.5 billion in the government fiscal year 2010
(ending September 30) to $705.6 billion in 2011, $677.9 billion in 2012, $633.4 billion in 2013, $603.5 in 2014, $597.5 in 2015
and $604.5 in 2016. This decrease has had a significant negative impact on Microphase s customers, with a resultant negative
impact on Microphase s results during and prior to the past three fiscal years. 

The Company has been selling the same products
to the same customers for many years. While every product order is manufactured to each customer s specifications, the overall
product offering has not changed substantially. The Company believes it will need to introduce new products to the market in order
to grow sales, in accordance with its strategy described in  Current Status and Management s Plans.  The Company
has been addressing its working capital needs by raising additional debt from insiders, by executing private placements of common
stock, and through debt facility with Gerber Finance, Inc. 

Growth Strategy  

While our core market historically has
been the military electronics defense industry, we intend to leverage our high-frequency RF and microwave expertise to expand into
high growth sectors of the wireless and RF microwave industries where we believe that we can command significant leadership. Our
strategic plan for future growth is to develop and/or acquire proprietary technologies and solutions that will improve upon existing
solutions and products in the areas of cost, size, weight, reliability and performance. 

As a customer-driven global provider of
RF/Microwave components, devices, and integrated assemblies, we plan to expand market penetration in emerging technology markets,
including fifth generation (5G) wireless mobile communications, commercial drone systems, and the Internet of Things ( IoT ),
which provides for advanced interconnection of devices, systems, and services within the existing Internet infrastructure and is
expected to rely heavily on wireless links to enable automation in nearly all fields from residential to commercial, healthcare
and industrial markets. 

The Company is working to develop innovative
solutions that we expect will drive our strategic roadmap for long-term growth and profitability. Discussions are underway for
collaboration and joint development with certain potential strategic partners as we aggressively pursue access to niche products
and solutions with first-to-market opportunities in these high growth market segments. This strategy could enable Microphase to
broaden its customer base and reduce risk by spreading its revenue base across multiple market sectors. Acquisitions and/or joint
ventures, if completed successfully, could increase our market share and the technology value of our product lines as well as broaden
our product offerings and diversify our customer base. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities
in the following three key market segments: 

test and measurement;   

electronic filters; and   

high power amplifiers.   

ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS  

The Company is responding to the decrease
in the defense budget by pursuing the acquisition of companies and product lines which are similar and/or related to the Company s
existing product lines and which may provide the Company with opportunities to expand beyond military markets. On March 27, 2013,
the Company acquired the assets of a DLVA manufacturing business in Folsom, California from Microsemi Corp. pursuant to a purchase
agreement (the  Microsemi Agreement ) for a purchase price comprised of $100,000 in cash plus a $650,000 note, which
was paid in full prior to its maturity in December 2014 (the  Microsemi Transaction ). The assets acquired pursuant
to the Microsemi Transaction were operated as a division and referred to as  Microphase West,  until such operations
were moved to Shelton, Connecticut in July 2016. 

On July 9, 2014, the Company executed a
securities purchase agreement with AmpliTech Group Inc. of Bohemia, N.Y. to purchase, as amended, 8,666,666 AmpliTech common shares
at $0.023 per share for a total purchase price of $200,000. The purchase price was made up of two installments of $100,000. AmpliTech
designs, engineers and assembles amplifiers for micro-wave components primarily for communication systems. As of May 12, 2016,
we owned 18.8% of the outstanding shares of Amplitech Common Stock. To date, this has been a passive investment. As of September
30, 2016, the value of these shares was $385,667. 

On January 21, 2016, the Company entered
the T M industry by entering into a purchase agreement (as subsequently amended, the  Dynamac Agreement ) with
Dynamac, Inc. ( Dynamac ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire certain assets in a line of proprietary
RF and microwave test and measurement products, as well as related intellectual property ( Dynamac Assets ). On November
2, 2016, the Company entered into that certain First Amendment to Purchase Agreement with Dynamac (the  Dynamac Amendment ),
pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed that Dynamac would retain ownership of the Dynamac assets until the Company
has paid all amounts owed pursuant to the Dynamac agreement, with such amounts due within 10 days of the closing of the Offering. The Company intends to pay all amounts owed to Dynamac pursuant
to the Dynamac agreement from the proceeds thereof. 

We believe the Dynamac Assets to be acquired
pursuant to the Dynamac Transaction will enable us to grow sales revenue in accordance with our growth strategy. 

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016
VS. SEPTEMBER 30, 2015  

Revenues.     Total
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,373,064, down from $2,451,855 in the same period in 2015, a decrease
of $1,078,791 or 44%. The revenue decrease was primarily due to a reduction in overall customer orders resulting in a reduced backlog,
with a less efficient mix of products. In addition, the closure of the California plant in July 2016 and the transfer of inventory
and work in process back to the East Coast plant in Shelton reduced shipments in the quarter. Additionally, there was a significant
slow-down for the quarter on an important program, due to a critical vendor part not being available. The decrease to domestic
customers was $913,391 in that period for 2016 and the decrease in shipments to foreign customers was $165,400. 

Cost of Sales.     Cost
of sales decreased $471,301 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 from $1,451,183 in 2015 to $979,882 in 2016, a
decrease of 33%. The decrease in the cost of sales was primarily due to the decrease in revenues. The gross profit margin for that
same period for 2015 was 42%, whereas the gross profit margin for the same 2016 period was 29%. The decrease in the gross profit
margin was due to a less profitable product mix. 

General and Administrative Expenses.  
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $738,850 for the 3 months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $703,000
for the same period in 2015, an increase of $35,850 or 5%. The increase resulted from stock-based compensation of $97,500 plus
Microphase Instruments rental expense of $40,704 for their new Shelton work spaces adjacent to Microphase, less reduced SG A
costs resulting from the California plant closure, and $26,800 reduction of expenses from a grant received from the State of Connecticut. 

Engineering and Research Expenses.  
  Engineering and research for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were up to $207,660 from $206,314 in the same
period in 2015, an increase of $1,346 or 0.7%. Engineering and research expenses were essentially flat year over year. 

Non-operating Income (Loss).  
  Non-operating income was $2,250 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and $0 for the same period in 2016. 

Interest (Expense and Credit costs)
net.     Interest expense and credit costs were $58,171 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and $111,895
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $53,734. The higher interest costs in 2016 were primarily the result
of increased interest rates on over-advances from the Gerber Loan facility plus approximately $35,000 accrued interest on the Dynamac
Loan repayment plan. 

Net Income (Loss).  
  The Company recorded a net loss of ($666,273) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net
income of $70,387 for the same period in 2015, a decrease of $736,660. The decrease was caused by the significant decline in
revenues period over period, initial operational costs of $81,259 for Microphase Instruments in 2016 vs $0 in 2015, and the
extra costs relative to the move of our California operations to Connecticut. 

This represents basic (loss) per common
share of $(0.107) in 2016 as compared to income per common share of $0.015 in 2015, based upon basic weighted average common
shares outstanding during the three month periods ending September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 of 6,201,858 and 4,775,306,
respectively. This represents diluted loss per common share of $(0.107) in 2016 as compared to diluted income per common share
of $0.011 in 2015, based upon basic weighted average   diluted common shares outstanding during the same periods, of 6,201,858
 and 6,122,456 respectively. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Through the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company reported net loss of $666,273 and had cash of $16,389. At September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit
of $14,605,924. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $2,706,671 as compared to a working capital
deficit of $2,301,573 as of June 30, 2016, an increase of $405,098 in the deficit. 

This decrease is primarily due to the reduction
in accounts receivable of $725,463, other current assets of $60,480 and inventory of $118,955. The working capital deficit was
also increased by $140,000 additional expenditures in connection with our impending stock offering. We were able to reduce our
credit line by $629,203 due to the dramatic reduction in accounts receivable. 

Our financial condition raises substantial
doubt that we will be able to continue as a  going concern , and our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
included an explanatory paragraph regarding this uncertainty in their report on our financial statements as of June 30, 2016 when
we had an accumulated deficit of $13,939,651 and a working capital deficit of $2,301,573. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the cash from operating activities was $225,495, primarily because of the net loss of ($666,273) was offset by depreciation
and amortization of $21,872, decreases in accounts receivable of $725,463, inventory of $118,955 and other current assets of $60,480,
and an increase in accrued expenses of $56,609. The cash from operating activities was reduced primarily by a reduction of accounts
payable of $158,763 and deferred revenue of $44,600. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2015, the cash used in operating activities was ($87,988), primarily because of net income of $70,387, which was offset by
an increase in accounts receivable of $224,429, a decrease in accounts payable of $61,823, and an increase in amounts due from
related parties of $2,250. Cash provided by operating activities increased due to depreciation and amortization of $23,266, to
a decrease in inventory of $12,755, and to an increase in accrued expenses of $98,519. 

Cash (Used In) Investing Activities consisted
of no activity during the three month period ended in September 30, 2016, as compared to the purchase of $35,919 of fixed assets
during the same three month period in 2015. 

During the three months
ended September 30, 2016, the company received net $45,000 pursuant to a stock purchase agreement where the Company will
issue 33,334 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 33,334 shares of common stock to an accredited
investor in a private placement of its common stock pursuant to section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
During the same 3 month period in 2015, the Company did not issue any shares of its common stock. 

The Company entered into a revolving
credit facility with Gerber Finance, Inc ( Gerber ) in 2012 with a maximum for this line, as amended, of
$1,400,000. The outstanding balance as of September 30, 2016 was $844,926 and as of June 30, 2015 was $1,474,129. Under this
agreement the Company receives funds based on a borrowing base which consists of various percentages of certain assets. The
current interest rate is 7%, and there is an annual facility fee of 1.75%, plus monthly collateral monitoring fees of $1,500
and other fees. As of September 30, 2016 the Company was not in compliance with these financial covenants regarding minimum
levels of net worth, net income and subordinated debt. The Company has not received a notice of default from Gerber regarding
these covenants and has been in discussions with Gerber regarding resolving the noncompliance. The Company expects to meet
the minimum level of net worth covenant upon completion of the Offering. 

Cash (Used In) Financing activities totaled
$290,330 during the three month period in 2016, primarily from the $629,203 pay down of the borrowings from our line from Gerber,
reduced by debt service of $3,161 for our equity lines, reduced by $871 for long term debt, and reduced by $2,095 for payments
for extended term arrangements. There was also an increase in financing activities from a note from the State of Connecticut for
$300,000 and also the issuance of common stock for $45,000. 

The terms and conditions of the purchase agreement with Dynamac
require semi-annual payments due in August 2016 and 2017 and February 2017 and 2018 of $550,000, which the Company imputed interest
at 7%, its most favorable credit line rate, and as such is valued at $2,020,425. The payment owed to Dynamac in August 2016 has
a grace period until October 22, 2016. On November 2, 2016, we entered into that certain First Amendment to Purchase Agreement
with Dynamac (the  Dynamac Amendment  and, the January Dynamac Agreement, as amended by the Dynamac Amendment, the
 Dynamac Transaction ), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed that Dynamac would retain ownership
in the Dynamac Assets until the Company has delivered all amounts owed pursuant to the Dynamac Transaction, with such amounts due
upon closing of the Offering and the Company to pay such amounts from the proceeds thereof. 

The amounts owed by the Company pursuant to the related party
notes are four months in arrears. 

THE COMPANY HAS MATERIAL DEBT SERVICE
COMMITMENTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 8   9 SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:  

During September and October 2016, the
Company commenced a private placement for 333,334 shares issuable to accredited investors in an interim private placement of our
common stock pursuant to section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This pending private placement and issuance is
expected to generate $450,000 of net proceeds to the Company after deducting $50,000 of placement fees upon completion. The terms
also provide for 333,334 shares issuable upon exercise of warrants issued in connection with the private placement of 333,334 shares
discussed above at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. Additionally, the Company entered into a one year agreement for investment
banking services which calls for $60,000 of consulting fees to be paid in cash from the proceeds of this placement and $50,000
to be paid in common stock, at the per share value of the Offering, upon the completion of the Offering. 

Through November 9, 2016 the Company has
received $400,000 of these proceeds, of which $50,000 was received during the Quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Also in October 2016, the Company has offered
to issue notes for bridge loans for a total of $700,000 from accredited investors that are expected to generate $630,000 in net
proceeds to the Company after deducting $70,000 of placement fees upon completion. Additionally; the Company entered into a one
year agreement for investment banking services which calls for $120,000 of consulting fees to be paid in cash from the proceeds
of the bridge loans and $90,000 to be paid in common stock, at the per share value of the Offering, upon the completion
of the Offering. 

The terms of this bridge debt will
be pursuant to note purchase agreements with purchasers that are accredited investors, for notes (up to) in the aggregate
amount of $700,000, at an interest rate of 10% per annum (the  Notes ), from financing sources identified by and
placed by Spartan Capital Securities, LLC ( Spartan ) in accordance with a certain Selling Agreement by and
between the Company and Spartan. Each of the Notes will be repaid as follows: (i) in the event that the public offering of
the Company s securities that is contemplated pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on
July 28, 2016 (the  Offering ) closes prior to the first anniversary of the issuance date of such Note, the
amount that is equal to (A) the entire original principal amount of such Note multiplied by 1.25 plus (B) the interest, if
any, accrued quarterly, every 90 days, beginning on the date that is 90 days from the issuance date of such Note on the
entire outstanding principal amount, will be due and payable by no later than five days from the date of the closing of the
Offering; or (ii) in the event that the Offering has not closed prior to the first anniversary of the issuance date of such
Note, on such first anniversary of the issuance date of such Note, the amount that is equal to (A) the amount that is equal
to the entire original principal amount of such Note multiplied by 1.25, plus (B) the interest accrued quarterly, every 90
days, beginning on the date that is 90 days from the issuance date of such Note on the entire outstanding principal amount
will be due and payable. In the event that the Offering closes on a date that is sooner than 90 days from the issuance date
of the Notes, no interest will accrue. 

CURRENT STATUS AND MANAGEMENT S
PLAN OF OPERATIONS  

The Company has been seeking to diversify
its market focus beyond its core products. By utilizing our current capabilities together with positioning ourselves through targeted
acquisitions, strategic alliances and product partnering we believe we can augment our current product offerings enabling us to
continue to introduce a mix of new military and commercial products for the wireless telecom, autonomous auto, test   measurements,
and medical instrumentation markets. This strategy should enable Microphase to broaden its customer base and reduce risk by spreading
its revenue base across multiple market sectors. Targeted strategic acquisitions should increase our market share and the technology
value of our product lines as well as broaden our product offering and diversify our customer base. 

The Company plans on continuing financing
operations through its debt facility with Gerber Financial, the issuance of debt to management, the settlement of debts for equity,
and the sale of common and preferred securities though private placements, until such time it can complete its initial public offering,
when and if declared effective, as described in its registration statement and impending amendment(s) on Form S-1, during the second
quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company also continues to boost efforts to increase the sales of its traditional RF and DLVA business
and anticipates the product growth plan to include the launch of its initial T M products by the later portion of fiscal 2017
implementing the assets acquired from Dynamac in January 2016. Management has also taken steps in fiscal 2016 to contain operating
expenses, including a reduction in the number of employees, primarily by consolidating all of its traditional design to manufacture
RF and DLVA business into the Shelton, Connecticut location. The Company has expanded its facility in square footage and utility
as such to house both our traditional RF and DLVA business, and enable the launch and delivery of its initial T M products. 

Management believes that these steps will
permit the Company to maintain the continuation of our traditional operations, and should we become further capitalized, allow
us to implement our product growth plan, which we believe will enable the Company to achieve and maintain a level of operations
which generates sustainable profitability and to continue as a going concern. However there can be no assurance that this will
be the case. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS  

The SEC defines critical accounting policies
as those that are, in management s view, most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations
and those that require significant judgments and estimates. 

The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including
the allowance for doubtful accounts, the salability and recoverability of inventory, income taxes and contingencies. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

We cannot predict what future laws and
regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations. We assess the impact of significant
changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements
when we deem it necessary. 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

The Company provides an allowance for doubtful
accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company s estimate is based on historical collection experience
and a review of the current status of Accounts Receivable. It is reasonably possible that the Company s estimate of the allowance
for doubtful accounts will change in the future. 

Depreciation and Amortization   

Property and equipment are recorded at
cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method for financial
statement purposes. The Company uses other depreciation methods (generally, accelerated depreciation methods) for tax purposes
where appropriate. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining
lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. 

Income Taxes   

The Company accounts for income taxes under
the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
740     Income Tax    . ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
tax bases of certain assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets
and liabilities generating the differences. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to
the amount expected to be realized. The Company has adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10-05  Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes . The ASC clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial
statements. The ASC prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The ASC provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. 

Inventory Obsolescence   

Inventory quantities and related values
are analyzed at the end of each fiscal quarter to determine those items that are slow moving or obsolete. An inventory reserve
is recorded for those items determined to be slow moving with a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold. Inventory items that
are determined obsolete are written off currently with a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold. 

Revenue Recognition   

Revenues and costs of revenues are recognized
during the period in which the products are shipped. The Company applies the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) 605-10, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ASC 605-10, which provides guidance on the recognition,
presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. ASC 605-10 outlines the basic criteria that
must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. In general, the
Company recognizes revenue for sale of products when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred,
(iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) the collectability is reasonably assured. 

The Company s sources of revenue
are from the sale of various component amplifiers and filters. Revenue is recognized upon shipment of such products, FOB shipping
point. The Company offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee against defects for 90 days after the sale of their product except for
a few circumstances. There are no maintenance or service contracts related to any product sale. 

OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS  

As of November 11, 2016, we did not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

ITEM 3.       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK  

The Company is not exposed to changes in
interest rates as the Company has no debt arrangements and no investments in certain held-to-maturity securities. Under our current
policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. A hypothetical 100 basis
point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of any
financial instruments at September 30, 2016. 

ITEM 4.       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures.  

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls
and procedures are effective. 

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

We are currently not involved in any litigation
that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body
pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting
our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in
their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

Right to Purchase [ ] shares of Common Stock of Microphase Corporation (subject to adjustment as provided herein)   

COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT  

MICROPHASE CORPORATION , a corporation
organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut (the   Company  ), hereby certifies that, for value received,
 ______________ , with an address at  _______________________________________,   or its assigns (the   Holder  ),
is entitled, subject to the terms set forth below, to purchase from the Company at any time after the Issue Date until 5:00 p.m.,
E.D.T. on the five (5) year anniversary of the Issue Date (the   Expiration Date  ), up to [ ] [ NTD:
100% coverage ] fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock at a per share purchase price of $2.50. The aforedescribed
purchase price per share, as adjusted from time to time as herein provided, is referred to herein as the   Purchase Price . 
The number and character of such shares of Common Stock and the Purchase Price are subject to adjustment as provided herein. The
Company may reduce the Purchase Price for some or all of the Warrants, temporarily or permanently,  provided  such reduction
is made as to all outstanding Warrants for all Holders of such Warrants.  

As used herein the
following terms, unless the context otherwise requires, have the following respective meanings: 

(a)        The
term   Common Stock   includes (i) the Company s Common Stock, no par value per share and (ii) any other
securities into which or for which any of the securities described in (i) may be converted or exchanged pursuant to a plan of recapitalization,
reorganization, merger, sale of assets or otherwise. 

(b)        The
term   Other Securities   refers to any stock (other than Common Stock) and other securities of the Company or
any other person (corporate or otherwise) which the holder of the Warrant at any time shall be entitled to receive, or shall have
received, on the exercise of the Warrant, in lieu of or in addition to Common Stock, or which at any time shall be issuable or
shall have been issued in exchange for or in replacement of Common Stock or Other Securities pursuant to  Section 4  hereof
or otherwise. 

(c)        The
term   Warrant Shares   shall mean the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. 

1.          Exercise
of Warrant. 

1.1.          Number
of Shares Issuable upon Exercise . From and after the Issue Date through and including the Expiration Date, the Holder shall
be entitled to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant in whole in accordance with the terms of  Section 1.2  hereof or upon
exercise of this Warrant in part in accordance with  Section 1.3  hereof, shares of Common Stock of the Company, subject to
adjustment pursuant to  Section 2  hereof. 

1.2.         Full
Exercise . This Warrant may be exercised in full by the Holder hereof by delivery to the Company of an original or facsimile
copy of the form of subscription attached as  Exhibit A  hereto (the   Subscription Form  ) duly executed
by such Holder and delivered within two (2) business days thereafter of payment, in cash, wire transfer or by certified or official
bank check payable to the order of the Company, in the amount obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for
which this Warrant is then exercisable by the Purchase Price then in effect. The original Warrant is not required to be surrendered
to the Company until it has been fully exercised. 

1.3.         Partial
Exercise . This Warrant may be exercised in part (but not for a fractional share) by delivery of a Subscription Form in the
manner and at the place provided in  Section 1.2  hereof, except that the amount payable by the Holder on such partial exercise
shall be the amount obtained by multiplying (a) the number of whole shares of Common Stock designated by the Holder in the Subscription
Form by (b) the Purchase Price then in effect. On any such partial exercise, upon the written request of the Holder, provided the
Holder has surrendered the original Warrant, the Company, at its expense, will forthwith issue and deliver to or upon the order
of the Holder a new Warrant of like tenor, in the name of the Holder hereof or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any
applicable transfer taxes) may request, the whole number of shares of Common Stock for which such Warrant may still be exercised. 

1.4.         Fair
Market Value . For purposes of this Warrant, the  Fair Market Value  of a share of Common Stock as of a particular date
(the   Determination Date  ) shall mean: 

(A)        If
the Company s Common Stock is traded on an exchange or on the NASDAQ Capital Market, NASDAQ Global Select Market, the New
York Stock Exchange or the NYSE Euronext, the average of the closing sale prices of the Common Stock for the five (5) trading days
immediately prior to (but not including) the Determination Date; 

(B)        If
the Company s Common Stock is not traded on an exchange or on the NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ Global Select Market, the
NASDAQ Capital Market, the New York Stock Exchange or the NYSE Euronext, but is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the over-the-counter
market or Pink Sheets, the average of the closing bid and ask prices reported for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to
(but not including) the Determination Date; 

2   

(C)        Except
as provided in clause (D) below, if the Company s Common Stock is not publicly traded, then as the Holder and the Company
shall mutually agree, or in the absence of such an agreement after good faith efforts of the Company and the Holder to reach an
agreement, by arbitration in accordance with the rules then standing of the American Arbitration Association, before a single arbitrator
to be chosen from a panel of persons qualified by education and training to pass on the matter to be decided; or 

(D)        If
the Determination Date is the date of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or any event deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution
or winding up pursuant to the Company s charter, then all amounts to be payable per share to holders of the Common Stock
pursuant to the charter in the event of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, plus all other amounts to be payable per share
in respect of the Common Stock in liquidation under the charter, assuming for the purposes of this clause (d) that all of the shares
of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of all of the Warrants are outstanding at the Determination Date. 

1.5.         Company
Acknowledgment . The Company will, at the time of the exercise of the Warrant, upon the request of the Holder hereof, acknowledge
in writing its continuing obligation to afford to such Holder any rights to which such Holder shall continue to be entitled after
such exercise in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant. If the Holder shall fail to make any such request, such failure
shall not affect the continuing obligation of the Company to afford to such Holder any such rights. 

1.6.         Delivery
of Stock Certificates, etc. on Exercise . The Company agrees that, provided the purchase price listed in the Subscription Form
is received as specified in  Section 2  hereof, the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be
deemed to be issued to the Holder hereof as the record owner of such shares as of the close of business on the date on which delivery
of a Subscription Form shall have occurred and payment made for such shares as aforesaid. As soon as practicable after the exercise
of this Warrant in full or in part and the payment is made, and in any event within five (5) business days thereafter (  Warrant
Share Delivery Date  ), the Company, at its expense (including the payment by it of any applicable issue taxes), will
cause to be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the Holder hereof, or as such Holder (upon payment by such Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may direct in compliance with applicable securities laws, a certificate or certificates for the number of duly
and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) to which such Holder shall be entitled
on such exercise, plus, in lieu of any fractional share to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled, either (i) cash equal
to such fraction multiplied by the then Fair Market Value of one full share of Common Stock, together with any other stock or other
securities and property (including cash, where applicable) to which such Holder is entitled upon such exercise pursuant to  Section
1  hereof or otherwise (ii) an extra share of Common Stock. The Company understands that a delay in the delivery of the Warrant
Shares after the Warrant Share Delivery Date could result in economic loss to the Holder. If a warrant holder notifies the Company
of such Holder s election to exercise and the Company does not deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise,
and the Holder has to buy shares of the Company s Common Stock on the open market because of the Holder s obligation
to deliver shares of Common Stock, then the Company will pay such Holder the difference between the price paid on the open market
and the value of such Common Stock on the date of exercise. The Company will also pay interest at the annual rate of 15% for each
day that it is late in delivering shares of its Common Stock.  

3   

2.        Adjustment
for Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, etc. 

2.1.         Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (A) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the
Company with or into another entity, (B) the Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series
of related transactions, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another entity) is completed pursuant
to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property, (D) the
Company consummates a stock purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, or spin-off) with one or more persons or entities whereby such other persons or entities acquire more than 50%
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by such other persons or entities making
or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other persons or entities making or party to, such stock purchase agreement or
other business combination), (E) any  person  or  group  (as these terms are used for purposes of Sections
13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  1934 Act ) is or shall become the  beneficial
owner  (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly, of 50% of the aggregate Common Stock of the
Company, or (F) the Company effects any reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which
the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a   Fundamental
Transaction  ), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each
Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction,
at the option of the Holder, (a) upon exercise of this Warrant, the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring
corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the   Alternate Consideration  )
receivable upon or as a result of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition of assets by a Holder
of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event or (b) if the Company
is acquired in (1) a transaction where the consideration paid to the holders of the Common Stock consists solely of cash, (2) a
 Rule 13e-3 transaction  as defined in Rule 13e-3 under the 1934 Act, or (3) a transaction involving a person or entity
not traded on a national securities exchange, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nasdaq Capital Market,
cash equal to the Black-Scholes Value (as defined herein). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Purchase
Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable
in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Purchase Price among
the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration.
If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction,
then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant
following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Company
or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder a new warrant consistent with the foregoing provisions
and evidencing the Holder s right to exercise such warrant into Alternate Consideration. The terms of any agreement pursuant
to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the
provisions of this  Section 2.1  and insuring that this Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted
upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction.   Black-Scholes Value   shall be determined
in accordance with the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model obtained from the  OV  function on Bloomberg L.P. using (i)
a price per share of Common Stock equal to the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock for the trading day immediately
preceding the date of consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, (ii) a risk-free interest rate corresponding to the
U.S. Treasury rate for a period equal to the remaining term of this Warrant as of the date of such request and (iii) an expected
volatility equal to the 100 day volatility obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg L.P. determined as of the trading day immediately
following the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction. 

4   

2.2.         Continuation
of Terms . Upon any reorganization, consolidation, merger or transfer (and any dissolution following any transfer) referred
to in this  Section 2  hereof, this Warrant shall continue in full force and effect and the terms hereof shall be applicable
to the Other Securities and property receivable on the exercise of this Warrant after the consummation of such reorganization,
consolidation or merger or the effective date of dissolution following any such transfer, as the case may be, and shall be binding
upon the issuer of any Other Securities, including, in the case of any such transfer, the person acquiring all or substantially
all of the properties or assets of the Company, whether or not such person shall have expressly assumed the terms of this Warrant
as provided in  Section 5  hereof. 

3.         Accredited
Investor Status . This Warrant may only be exercised by a Holder that is an  accredited investor  as that term is
defined in Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

4.         Extraordinary
Events Regarding Common Stock . In the event that the Company shall (a) issue additional shares of Common Stock as a dividend
or other distribution on outstanding Common Stock, (b) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (c) combine its outstanding
shares of the Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then, in each such event, the Purchase Price shall,
simultaneously with the happening of such event, be adjusted by multiplying the then Purchase Price by a fraction, the numerator
of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event and the denominator of which
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the product so obtained shall thereafter
be the Purchase Price then in effect. The Purchase Price, as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening
of any successive event or events described in this  Section 4 . The number of shares of Common Stock that the Holder of this
Warrant shall thereafter, on the exercise hereof, be entitled to receive shall be adjusted to a number determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise (but for the provisions of this  Section 4 ) be issuable on such
exercise by a fraction of which (a) the numerator is the Purchase Price that would otherwise (but for the provisions of this  Section
4 ) be in effect, and (b) the denominator is the Purchase Price in effect on the date of such exercise. 

5   

5.         Certificate
as to Adjustments . In each case of any adjustment or readjustment in the shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable
on the exercise of the Warrants or in the Purchase Price, the Company at its expense will promptly cause its Chief Financial Officer
or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of the Warrant and prepare
a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment
is based, including a statement of (a) the consideration received or receivable by the Company for any additional shares of Common
Stock (or Other Securities) issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (b) the number of shares of Common Stock (or
Other Securities) outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (c) the Purchase Price and the number of shares of Common Stock
to be received upon exercise of this Warrant, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as adjusted or
readjusted as provided in this Warrant. The Company will forthwith mail a copy of each such certificate to the Holder of the Warrant
and any Warrant Agent (as defined herein) of the Company (appointed pursuant to  Section 10  hereof). Holder will be entitled
to the benefit of the adjustment regardless of the giving of such notice. The timely giving of such notice to Holder is a material
obligation of the Company. 

6.         Reservation
of Stock, etc. Issuable on Exercise of Warrant; Financial Statements . The Company will at all times reserve and keep available,
solely for issuance and delivery on the exercise of the Warrants, all shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) from time to
time issuable on the exercise of the Warrant. This Warrant entitles the Holder hereof, upon written request, to receive copies
of all financial and other information distributed or required to be distributed to the holders of the Company s Common Stock. 

7.         Assignment;
Exchange of Warrant . Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, this Warrant, and the rights evidenced hereby,
may be transferred by any registered holder hereof (a   Transferor  ). On the surrender for exchange of this Warrant,
with the Transferor s endorsement in the form of  Exhibit B  attached hereto (the   Transferor Endorsement Form  )
and together with an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the transfer of this Warrant will be in compliance
with applicable securities laws, the Company will issue and deliver to or on the order of the Transferor thereof a new Warrant
or Warrants of like tenor, in the name of the Transferor and/or the transferee(s) specified in such Transferor Endorsement Form
(each a   Transferee  ), calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of shares of Common
Stock called for on the face or faces of the Warrant so surrendered by the Transferor. 

6   

8.         Replacement
of Warrant . On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of
this Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction of this Warrant, on delivery of an indemnity agreement or
security reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the Company or, in the case of any such mutilation, on surrender and cancellation
of this Warrant, the Company at its expense, twice only, will execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor. 

9.         Maximum
Exercise . The Holder shall not be entitled to exercise this Warrant on an exercise date, in connection with that number of
shares of Common Stock which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the
Holder and its Affiliates on an exercise date, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this
Warrant with respect to which the determination of this limitation is being made on an exercise date, which would result in beneficial
ownership by the Holder and its Affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on such date. For the purposes
of the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act
and Rule 13d-3 thereunder. Subject to the foregoing, the Holder shall not be limited to aggregate exercises which would result
in the issuance of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. The restriction described in this paragraph may be
waived, in whole or in part, upon sixty-one (61) days  prior notice from the Holder to the Company to increase such percentage. 

10.         Warrant
Agent . The Company may, by written notice to the Holder, appoint an agent (a   Warrant Agent  ) for the purpose
of issuing Common Stock (or Other Securities) on the exercise of this Warrant pursuant to  Section 1  hereof, exchanging this
Warrant pursuant to  Section 7  hereof, and replacing this Warrant pursuant to  Section 8  hereof, or any of the foregoing,
and thereafter any such issuance, exchange or replacement, as the case may be, shall be made at such office by such Warrant Agent. 

11.         Transfer
on the Company s Books . Until this Warrant is transferred on the books of the Company, the Company may treat the registered
holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 

12.         Notices .
All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals, and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing
and, unless otherwise specified herein, shall be (i) personally served, (ii) deposited in the mail, registered or certified, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, (iii) delivered by reputable air courier service with charges prepaid, or (iv) transmitted

13.         Law
Governing This Warrant . This Warrant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws or of any other State. Any action brought by either party hereto against
the other concerning the transactions contemplated by this Warrant shall be brought only in the state courts of New York or in
the federal courts located in the state and county of New York. The parties to this Warrant hereby irrevocably waive any objection

be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney s fees and costs. In the event that any provision of
this Warrant or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or
rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified
to conform to, such statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of any agreement. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives personal
service of process and consents to process being served in any suit, action or proceeding in connection with this Warrant or any
other transaction document by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery)
to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Warrant and agrees that such service shall constitute good

person (a   controlling person  ) may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (  Claims  ) arise out of or are based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement at the time of its effectiveness,
any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are

upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information pertaining to the Subscriber, as such, furnished in writing to the Company by the Subscriber specifically for use in

(iii)        Promptly
after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof,
but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified
party other than under this section and shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party under
this section except and only if and to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such omission. In case any
such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense
thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified
party under this section for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected; provided, however, that, if the defendants
in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the
indemnifying party, the indemnified parties, as a group, shall have the right to select one separate counsel and to assume such
legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate
counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. The indemnifying
party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding affected without its written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. 

(iv)        In
order to provide for just and equitable contribution in the event of joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which
either (i) the Subscriber, or any controlling person of a Subscriber, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this section
but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration
of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding
the fact that this section provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required
on the part of the Subscriber or controlling person of the Subscriber in circumstances for which indemnification is not provided
under this section, then, and in each such case, the Company and the Subscriber will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims,
damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in a manner that reflects, as near as practicable,
the economic effect of the foregoing provisions of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person or entity guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person
or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

placement of a legend thereon, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the
Unlegended Shares by crediting the account of Subscriber s broker with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system.
Such delivery must be made on or before the Unlegended Shares Delivery Date but is subject to the cooperation of the Subscriber s
broker (the so-called DTC participant). 

(iii)        The
