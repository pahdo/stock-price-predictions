ORGANIZATION

New Asia Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as DM Products, Inc, previously known as Midwest E.S.W.T. Corp, and previously known as Effective Sport Nutrition Corporation) (the "Company" or "NAHD") was incorporated on March 1, 2001. Prior to December 2014, we were in the business of locating inventive products and introducing these products (such as the Banjo Minnow Fishing Lure System) through a Direct Response Model, a form of marketing that allows potential consumers direct access to the seller without the necessity of traditional retail. In December 2014, the Company underwent a change in control as a result of approximately 90% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company being acquired by New Asia Holdings, Ltd. (wholly owned by Lin Kok Peng, Ph.D.) and other accredited investors and management adopting a new business plan based on developing highly advanced, proprietary, neural trading models for the financial community.

We offer trading software solutions to clients on the basis of a "Software as a Service (SaaS)" licensing and delivery models with licensed users availing themselves of service-based contractual arrangements. In addition, we will utilize our in-house proprietary neural trading models to trade our own funds, thus providing added value to our shareholders.

The Company's focus is to capitalize the large volume of the 24 hours Forex markets to achieve capital appreciation over a medium to long term combined with the usage of a good wealth vehicle in order to control risk, profit from both bull or bear markets, maximize liquidity and economic resilience.

On January 21, 2015, Lin Kok Peng resigned from the position of Secretary of the Company while Scott C. Kline was appointed as the Secretary, replacing Lin Kok Peng, and as General Counsel of the Company.

On January 23, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada effecting a name change of the Company from DM Products, Inc. to New Asia Holdings, Inc. (the "Name Change"). The Company notified the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") of the Name Change and a new trading symbol, "NAHD", was assigned effective February 13, 2015 as well as a new CUSIP number (64202A109) for the Company's common stock.

On August 19, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a resolution acknowledging that New Asia Holdings Ltd, the principal controlling shareholder of the Company, (i) had been advancing funds in the amount of $220,000 to the Company since December 24, 2014 to pay for operating expenses of the Company and (ii) would be required to advance an additional $80,000 to the Company to fund further operating expenses of the Company. The Board further resolved that these advances would constitute an interest-free loan to the Company to be repaid by the close of business on October 31, 2015. However, if the Company was unable to repay these advances by such date, New Asia Holdings Ltd, at its sole discretion, would have the option to extend the repayment deadline or convert all or a portion of the above advances into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $0.02 per share. As of September 30, 2016, the principal shareholder, New Asia Holdings Ltd, had not yet acted to exercise its option to convert the advances to shares of common stock, thus the Advances presently remain as an interest-free loan to the Company.

On August 28, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Magdallen Quant Pte Ltd., a Singapore-based company, which is focused on the research, development and deployment of advanced, proprietary, trainable trading algorithms. The acquisition was accomplished through a share exchange with Mr. Anthony Ng Zi Qin of 7,422,000 new restricted shares of common stock of the Company with a fair value of $3,043,020 in exchange for the entire issued and outstanding capital of Magdallen Quant Pte Ltd., held by Mr. Anthony Ng Zi Qin, consisting of 8,000,100 shares issued at par value of SGD$1.00 per share, or USD$0.714 on the acquisition date and additional contingent consideration of $4,099,837.

On September 7, 2015, Mr. Scott C. Kline ("Mr. Kline") resigned as Secretary and General Counsel of the Company. The resignation was not as a result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. On that date, Mr. Jose A. Capote ("Mr. Capote") was appointed to serve as the Company's Secretary and Vice President. There is no family relationship between Mr. Capote and any of the Company's directors or officers. Mr. Capote is currently a shareholder of the Company through his 50% ownership of Earth Heat Ltd.

On August 19, 2016, the Company entered into an Addendum to the Magdallen Quant Pte Ltd Share and Purchase Agreement with Mr. Anthony Ng Zi Qin to extend the August 25, 2016 anniversary date for the adjustment of issued shares for an additional period of twelve (12) months.

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim consolidated financial information and with the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Form 10-Q and Article 8 of SEC Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been included.  Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year.  These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  In preparing these financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, and advances from shareholder. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates, unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.

ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, "Financial Instruments," defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company currently has a purchase price contingency.

At September 30, 2016, the Company identified the following liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheet at fair value:

At December 31, 2015, the Company identified the following liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheet at fair value:

Note 2:   Going Concern  

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has substantial losses, has a working capital deficit of $343,832 (not including the contingent liability of $5,806,897), and is in need of additional capital to grow its operations so that it can become profitable. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

In view of these matters, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon growth of revenues and the ability of the Company to raise additional capital. Management believes that its successful ability to raise capital and increases in revenues will provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Note 3:   Related Party Transactions  

There were advances in the amount of $99,421 from significant shareholders during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.  The total advances due are $415,954 and $316,533 to the significant shareholders as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Pursuant to the Board resolutions described in Note 1 above, $316,533 of the advances constitute unsecured interest-free loans to the Company.  The advances accruing under the Board resolutions were supposed to have been repaid by the close of business on October 31, 2015. In 2015, however, in accordance with the Board resolutions, if the Company was unable to repay these advances by such date, New Asia Holdings Ltd, at its sole discretion, would have the option to extend the repayment deadline or convert all or a portion of the above advances into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $0.02 per share. As of September 30, 2016, the principal shareholder, New Asia Holdings Ltd, had not yet acted to exercise its option to convert the advances to shares of common stock, thus the advances presently remain as an interest-free loan to the Company. The $99,421 borrowed during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are non-interest bearing unsecured, and due on demand.

On September 7, 2015, Mr. Jose A. Capote ("Mr. Capote") was appointed to serve as the Company's Secretary and Vice President. There is no family relationship between Mr. Capote and any of the Company's directors or officers. Mr. Capote is currently a shareholder of the Company through his 50% ownership of Earth Heat Ltd. The Company has paid Mr. Capote consulting fees for acting in the capacity as Secretary and Vice President of the Company in the amount of $13,500 and $7,500 for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

Pursuant to the Sale   Purchase Agreement, and the addendum executed on August 19, 2016, relating to the Company's acquisition of issued and outstanding shares of Magdallen Quant Pte Ltd in exchange for new restricted shares of common stock of the Company, if the average trading price of the Company's shares based on the 7 days closing price over the period immediately before the second anniversary date (August 25, 2017) of this Agreement and the 7th day falling on the first anniversary date of the agreement is below USD $1.00, the Company shall issue additional shares to Anthony Ng Zi Qin to make up the difference between the value of the Consideration Shares based on such 7 days closing history and the sum of SGD 10,000,000. The difference between the fair value of the assets acquired and the value of the shares swapped ($4,099,837) as well as the negative change in the common stock share price ($1,707,060) for the period ended September 30, 2016 created a contingent liability in amount of $5,806,897 in U.S. Dollars. The negative change in common share price occurred because the stock price decreased from $0.20 per share as of June 30, 2016 to $0.18 per share as of September 30, 2016. The Company recorded a loss in change in fair value of $148,440 and $371,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This item contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about our industry, management beliefs, and certain assumptions made by our management. Words such as "anticipates", "expects", "intends", "plans", "believes", "seeks", "estimates", variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. However, readers should carefully review the risk factors set forth in other reports and documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form 8-K.

Executive Overview

New Asia Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as DM Products, Inc, previously known as Midwest E.S.W.T. Corp, and previously known as Effective Sport Nutrition Corporation) (the "Company" or "NAHD") was incorporated on March 1, 2001. Prior to December 2014, we were in the business of locating inventive products and introducing these products (such as the Banjo Minnow Fishing Lure System) through a Direct Response Model, a form of marketing that allows potential consumers direct access to the seller without the necessity of traditional retail. In December 2014, the Company underwent a change in control as a result of approximately 90% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company being acquired by New Asia Holdings, Inc. (wholly owned by Lin Kok Peng, Ph.D.)  and management adopting a new business plan based on developing highly advanced, proprietary, neural trading models for the financial community.

It is our belief that our state-of-the-art, trainable, algorithms in our models will emulate aspects of the human brain, providing our algorithms with a self-training ability to formalize unclassified information and thus develop an enhanced ability to make forecasts based on the historical information and other data available at their disposal. Our neural networks will not make forecasts, instead, they will analyze price data and uncover opportunities. Using our proprietary neural network, trade decisions will be made based on thoroughly analyzed data (which is not generally possible when using traditional technical analysis methods). We anticipate offering a series of "next-generation" tools that can detect subtle non-linear interdependencies and patterns that other methods of technical analysis are unable to uncover.

10

We will offer trading software solutions to clients on the basis of a "Software as a Service (SaaS)" licensing and delivery models with licensed users availing themselves of service-based contractual arrangements. In addition, we will utilize our in-house proprietary neural trading models to trade our own funds, thus providing added value to our shareholders.

Our proprietary trading models will be developed by a team of professional engineers in communications, electronic circuitry design and financial engineering. This diverse team will be the key factor of our successful development of non-traditional and innovative trading models. Our systems will be designed to take intelligent positions as the market moves/changes and, upon development, our systems will bring a proven, rigorously tested, track-record. We anticipate that our proprietary algorithmic trading systems will generate superior, risk adjustable, returns for our clients.

The Company's focus is to capitalize the volatility of the 24 hours Forex markets to achieve capital appreciation over a medium to long term combined with the usage of a good wealth vehicle in order to control risk, profit from both bull or bear markets, maximize liquidity and economic resilience (recession proof).

The NAHD systems have been designed to constantly adapt themselves and to take intelligent positions as the market moves/changes. The models are subjected to rigorous testing akin to the volatile trading environment of major financial events/crisis that happened in recent history. These models are also programmed to have the ability to learn and adapt new manners of trading; effectively translating the human behavioral of trading into a predictive science. The NAHD cutting edge quantitative strategies and proprietary algorithmic trading system are developed to generate superior risk adjustable returns for the Holders.

On August 28, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Magdallen Quant Pte Ltd. The acquisition was accomplished through a share exchange with Mr. Anthony Ng Zi Qin of 7,422,000 new restricted shares ("Consideration Shares") of common stock of the Company, at a market value of $0.41 per share, with an aggregate fair value of $3,043,020 in exchange for the entire issued and outstanding capital of Magdallen Quant Pte Ltd., held by Mr. Anthony Ng Zi Qin, consisting of 8,000,100 shares of stock issued at par value of SGD$1.00 per share, or USD$0.714 on the acquisition date.

Results of Operations

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

We had related party revenue of $5,638, and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015 respectively. These revenues resulted from fees received from the Company's licensee, New Asia Momentum Limited, NAML, (a Company owned and controlled by NAHD Chairman and CEO). Since placing the Algorithms into operations, the Company's licensee, NAML has increased its Assets Under Management (AUM) from zero to approximately $1,515,000 and from zero clients to 47 in the span of nine months. The Algorithms have achieved an average return of between 16% to 21% per month.

Operating expenses were $45,309 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, and consisted primarily of general and administrative expenses, communication expenses and professional fees. This compares with operating expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 of $65,874 which consisted primarily of general and administrative expenses, stock compensation expense, and professional fees. The material decreases in such operating expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were related to a decrease in legal and accounting fees and the absence of stock-based compensation.  As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss from operations of $39,671 and a net loss of $188,111 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, which includes a contingent liability associated with the change in fair value of the acquired asset of $148,440 for the period ended September 30, 2016.  This compares with a net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 of $436,974, which includes a contingent liability associated with the change in fair value of the acquired asset of $371,100 for the period ended September 30, 2015

11

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

We had related party revenue $27,237 and $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015 respectively.

Operating expenses were $172,313 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, and consisted primarily of general and administrative expenses, communication expenses and professional fees. This compares with operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 of $964,985, which consisted primarily of general and administrative expenses, stock compensation expense, and professional fees. The material decrease in such operating expenses in third quarter of 2016 were related to a decrease in legal and accounting fees and the absence of stock based compensation.  As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss from operations of $145,076 and net loss of $293,516, which includes $148,440 in contingent liabilities as described above, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.  This compares with a net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 of $1,336,085, including $371,100 of contingent liabilities, as described above.

After the change in control, the Company is focused on a new business model, as described above. We expect that we will need to raise additional funds to support the expansion of our new business model, including, working capital to support the implementation of new projects, or if we must respond to unanticipated events that require us to make additional investments. We cannot assure that additional financing will be available when needed on favorable terms, or at all.

From our acquisition of our proprietary trainable trading algorithms, we generated revenues from second quarter 2016, however, notwithstanding these developments we expect to incur operating losses through the balance of this year because we will be incurring expenses and not generating sufficient revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs. We expect to cover such shortfall in operating margins through advances from our principal shareholder and other fund-raising measures that the Company deems appropriate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources.

We had cash in the amount of $71,806 and $105,385 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  We had net cash used in operating activities for $134,167 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and $162,472 of net cash used by operating activities for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2015. We had no cash flows from investing activities and had cash flow of $99,421 from financing activities (from advances from shareholders) during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and $320,053 cash flows from financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.

12

Future Financings

While we have revenues through the 3rd Quarter 2016, we expect that we will continue to rely on advances from our principal shareholder as well as from other sources of financing, including private placements of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act").

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of September 30, 2016.

13

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The Company is not required by current SEC rules to include, and does not include, an auditor's attestation report. The Company's registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which our director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest averse to our interest.
