Note 1:   
 
  Basis of Presentation     
     
  The accompanying unaudited financial statements of CKX Lands, Inc. ( Company ) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information. They do not include all information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Except as described herein, there has been no material change in the information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements included in our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the accompanying financial statements.  
     
  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. These financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Form 10-Q for the quarter period ended September 30, 2015.  

Note 2:     
 
  Income Taxes     
     
  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company has analyzed its filing positions in federal and state income tax returns for the tax years that remain subject to examination, generally three years after filing. The Company believes that all filing positions are highly certain and that all income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained upon a taxing jurisdiction s audit. Therefore, no reserve for uncertain tax positions is required. No interest or penalties have been levied against the Company and none are anticipated.  

Note 3.   
 
  Company Operations     
     
  The Company s operations are classified into three principal operating segments that are all located in the United States: oil and gas, timber and surface. The Company s reportable business segments are strategic business units that offer income from different products all of which are derived from the Company lands. They are managed separately due to the unique aspects of each area.  
     
  Following is a summary of segmented operations information for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

Note 3.   
 
  Company Operations (continued)     

There are no intersegment sales reported in the accompanying income statements. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company evaluates performance based on income or loss from operations before income taxes excluding any nonrecurring gains and losses on securities held available-for-sale. Income before income tax represents net revenues less costs and expenses less other income and expenses of a general corporate nature. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used solely in the Company's operations within that segment.  
     
  Revenue from customers representing 5% or more of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively are:

  Land Purchases and Sales     
     
    Purchases    
     
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased the following 100% interest in approximate acres, land, timber and mineral rights:   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company purchased the following 100% interest in approximate acres, land, timber and mineral rights:   

1031 exchange proceeds of $187,500, discussed below, were applied to purchase of the 200 acres in Natchitoches parish, Louisiana.  
     
    Sales    
     
  During the second quarter of 2015, the Company sold its 1/6 th  interest in approximately 155 acres of land located in Jefferson Davis Parish for $187,500 and reported a gain of $170,853. This transaction was structured as a  deferred exchange using a qualified intermediary  pursuant to Paragraph 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code (1031 Exchange) for income tax purposes. Due to the 1031 exchange, the gain of $170,853 is deferred for income tax purposes. At September 30, 2015, the 1031 exchange has been completed and $187,500 in proceeds was used for the purchase of the 200 acres in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana discussed above.  

Note 5:   
 
  Subsequent Event   Related Party Transaction     
       
  On October 16, 2016, the Company entered into a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ) with Stream Wetlands Services, LLC ( Stream ). Under the terms of the MOU, Stream paid the Company $37,667 for a non-exclusive right to evaluate and market certain lands owned by the Company to their client for beneficial use purposes to compensate for wetlands impact. This non-exclusive right terminates in 6 months. If Stream is chosen to perform their client s project, the Company has agreed to put forth its best efforts to negotiate and enter into a mutually acceptable lease form. Due to the uncertainty of the contract award and project scope, we are unable to estimate the potential financial benefit, if any, to the Company. William Gray Stream, Company Director, is the president of Stream Wetlands Services, LLC.

Item 2.     
 
   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION   AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      
       
   Results of Operations   
     
    Revenue    
     
  Comparison of Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows:  

Oil and Gas   
     
  CKX leases its property to oil and gas operators and collects income through its land ownership in the form of oil and gas royalties and lease rentals revenues. A breakdown of oil and gas revenues follows:  

CKX received oil and/or gas revenues from 114 and 129 wells during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  The following schedule summarizes barrels and MCF produced and average price per barrel and per MCF.  

Notes to above schedule:  
     
   (1)  Before deduction of production and severance taxes.  
   (2)  Excludes plant products.   

Oil and Gas revenues declined by $313,035 from 2015 revenues. As indicated in the schedule above the decline was due to a decrease in production and declines in the average sales prices for both oil and gas and lower lease and geophysical revenues. Oil and Gas revenues are dependent on oil and gas producers  activities, are not predictable and can vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter  

8

Item 2.     
 
   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION   AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)      

Management believes oil and gas activity is driven by current and forecasted commodity prices, demand for oil and gas, and upstream and downstream industry activity. Based on available public information, management believes that oil and gas activity which includes oil and gas production as well as lease rentals will continue to be depressed when compared to 2015 reported amounts.  
     
  During 2016, the Company received timber revenues of $112,835 from a stumpage agreement executed in 2014. The Company has entered into an additional stumpage agreement in 2016 with a 24-month term and received an advance payment of $52,300 to be applied as the subject timber is harvested. We believe that due to heavy rains during the quarter, timber harvesting activities have not occurred.  
     
  Surface revenue decreased due to the timing of pipeline right of way agreements. As previously noted by management, pipeline, utility and other right of ways are not unusual to the Company; however, these types of revenue are not predictable and can vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter  
     
    Costs and Expenses    
     
  Oil and gas costs, primarily severance taxes, decreased by $22,511 in 2016. With the reduction in oil and gas revenues, the decrease was expected.  
     
  General and administrative expenses increased by $74,669 primarily due to increased officer salary, additional officer salary and property taxes related to successful land acquisitions in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, property managers  fees, and director fees which were offset by a decrease in professional fees.  
     
  Other costs and expenses incurred for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were materially consistent with 2015 reported amounts.

Item 2.     
 
   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION   AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)      
     
   Financial Condition   
     
  Current assets totaled $4,743,473 and total liabilities equaled $139,427 at September 30, 2016. Management believes available cash and certificates of deposit together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements and provide funds for strategic acquisitions. The Company has an available bank line of credit of $3,000,000.  
     
  In determining whether a dividend will be declared, the Board of Directors will take into account the Company s prior fiscal year s cash flows from operations and current economic conditions among other information deemed relevant.  
     
  Pursuant to a dividend reversion clause in the Company s Articles of Incorporation, dividends not claimed within one year after a dividend becomes payable will expire and revert in full ownership to the Company and the Company s obligation to pay such dividend will cease. During 2016 the Company received $6,507 in dividend reversions and none in 2015.  
     
    Issues and Uncertainties    
     
  This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those discussed below, which, among others, should be considered in evaluating the Company s financial outlook.  
     
  Revenues from oil and gas provide a significant portion of the Company s net income and cash flows. These revenues come from wells operated by other companies which CKX Lands, Inc. owns a royalty interest. Consequently, these revenues fluctuate due to changes in oil and gas prices and changes in the operations of these other companies.  

Item 3.     
 
   Not applicable.      

Item 4.     
 
   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES      
     
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
     
  The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the President, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by the report.  
     
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
     
  There were no significant changes with respect to the Company s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter covered by this report.
