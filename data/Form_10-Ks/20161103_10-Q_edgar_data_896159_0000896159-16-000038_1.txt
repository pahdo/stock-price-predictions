1  . General 
    
  a) Basis of presentation 
  On January 14, 2016, we completed the acquisition of The Chubb Corporation (Chubb Corp), creating a global leader in property and casualty insurance. We have changed our name from ACE Limited to Chubb Limited and plan to adopt the Chubb name globally, although some subsidiaries may continue to use ACE as a part of their name.  
    
  Chubb Limited is a holding company incorporated in Zurich, Switzerland. Chubb Limited, through its subsidiaries, provides a broad range of insurance and reinsurance products to insureds worldwide. Effective the first quarter of 2016, our results are reported through the following business segments: North America Commercial P C Insurance, North America Personal P C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance. This reflects our significantly larger and expanded operations subsequent to our acquisition of Chubb Corp. We have also redefined Corporate to include all run-off asbestos and environmental (A E) exposures, the results of our run-off Brandywine business, the results of Westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years, and certain run-off exposures. Prior period amounts of Chubb Limited (i.e., excluding the historical results of Chubb Corp) contained in this report have been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. Refer to Note   12   for additional information.  
    
  The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements, which include the accounts of Chubb Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, Chubb, we, us, or our), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting of normally recurring accruals) necessary for a fair statement of the results and financial position for such periods. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions, including internal reinsurance transactions, have been eliminated. 
    
  The results of operations and cash flows of Chubb Corp are included from the acquisition date forward (i.e., after January 14, 2016). The results of operations and cash flows for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  b) Accounting guidance adopted in 2016 
    
  Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued new guidance related to the accounting for debt issuance costs. The new guidance requires presentation of debt issuance costs in the Consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as a deferred charge. We retrospectively adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016 and reclassified $  60 million   of debt issuance costs from Other assets to Long term debt ($  58 million  ) and Trust preferred securities ($  2 million  ) as of December 31, 2015.  
    
  c) Accounting guidance not yet adopted 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard excludes from its scope the accounting for insurance contracts, leases, financial instruments, and certain other agreements that are governed under other GAAP guidance, but could affect the revenue recognition for certain of our claims management and risk control services. The updated guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met, in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. The standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Short-Duration Contracts 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires additional disclosures for short-duration insurance contracts. New disclosure will be required to provide more information about initial claim estimates and subsequent adjustments to those estimates, the methodologies and judgments used to estimate claims, and the timing, frequency, and severity of claims. The guidance is effective for us beginning with our 2016 annual reporting on Form 10-K. The guidance requires a change in disclosure only and adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Financial Instruments   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance that affects the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The guidance requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) and an assessment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses of available for sale debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. The standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018.  We are in the process of evaluating the effect the updated guidance will have on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for credit losses of financial instruments that are measured at amortized cost, including held to maturity securities and reinsurance recoverables, by applying an approach based on the current expected credit losses (CECL). The estimate of expected credit losses should consider historical information, current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset in order to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset on the Consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  The guidance also amends the current available for sale (AFS) security other-than-temporary impairment model by requiring an estimate of the expected credit loss (ECL) only when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset. The length of time the fair value of an AFS debt security has been below the amortized cost will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists. The AFS debt security model will also require the use of a valuation allowance.  
    
  The standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2019. We will be able to assess the effect of adopting this guidance on our financial condition and results of operations closer to the date of adoption. 
    
  Stock Compensation 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires recognition of the excess tax benefits or deficiencies of awards through net income rather than through additional paid in capital. Additionally, entities can elect to account for forfeitures related to share-based payments either as they occur or through an estimation method. If elected, the change to recognize forfeitures as they occur would be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings. The updated guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of 2017 with early adoption permitted. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Statement of Cash Flows 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows, including distributions received from equity method investments. The guidance requires entities to make an accounting policy election to present cash flows received either in operating cash flows or investing cash flows based on cumulative equity-method earnings or on the nature of the distributions. The updated guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 with early adoption permitted. The updated guidance should be applied retrospectively, unless it is impracticable to do so, at which point the guidance should be applied prospectively. We are in the process of evaluating the effect the updated guidance will have on our statements of cash flows.

2  . Acquisitions 
    
  The Chubb Corporation  
  On January 14, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Chubb Corp, a leading provider of middle-market commercial, specialty, surety, and personal insurance for   $29.5 billion  , comprising   $14.3 billion   in cash and   $15.2 billion   in newly-issued stock, based on the Chubb Limited (formerly ACE Limited) closing price on the acquisition date. In addition, we assumed outstanding equity awards to employees and directors with an attributed value of approximately   $323 million  .  The total consideration, including the assumption of equity awards, was   $29.8 billion  . We financed the cash portion of the transaction through a combination of   $9.0 billion   sourced from various Chubb Limited and Chubb Corp companies plus   $5.3 billion     of senior notes, which were issued in November 2015. Refer to Note   7   for additional information on the senior notes  .  
      
  Upon completion of the merger, each Chubb Corp common share (other than shares held by certain legacy Chubb Corp employee benefit plans) was canceled and converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the merger agreement, into the right to receive (i)   0.6019   of a Chubb Limited common share and (ii) $  62.93   in cash.  In addition, replacement equity awards were issued by Chubb Limited to the holders of Chubb Corp's outstanding equity awards (stock options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, deferred unit obligations, and performance units).  
    
  We believe the Chubb Corp acquisition is highly complementary to our existing business lines, distribution channels, customer segments, and underwriting skills. Chubb Corp has a substantial presence in the U.S. with a broad variety of coverages serving large corporate and upper middle market accounts, middle market and small commercial accounts, and personal lines. Together we are one of the largest commercial insurers in the U.S.  Internationally, where legacy ACE is a truly global insurer with extensive presence in 54 countries, Chubb Corp's operations in 25 markets added to our presence and capabilities and positioned us to better pursue important market opportunities globally.  The combined company is a leader in a number of global specialty and traditional products such as professional lines, risk management, workers' compensation, accident and health (A H), and other property and general casualty lines.

  Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries 

The table below details the purchase consideration and preliminary allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  During the second and third quarters of 2016, we reassessed certain components of our preliminary estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the net realizable value for Reinsurance recoverables on losses and loss expenses and Insurance and reinsurance balances receivable and certain components of the Deferred tax liabilities, which resulted in an adjustment to our preliminary estimates that increased Goodwill by   $85 million  . These estimates remain preliminary and are subject to adjustment. While they are not expected to be materially different than those shown, any material adjustments to the estimates will be reflected, retroactively, as of the date of the acquisition.       

            (1)   
    The estimated fair value of the replacement equity awards was $525 million, of which $323 million was attributed to service periods prior to the acquisition and was included in the purchase consideration. Refer to Note   10   for further information on these replacement equity awards. 
     Direct costs related to the Chubb Corp acquisition were expensed as incurred.  Chubb integration expenses were $  115 million   and $  361 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and include all internal and external

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   continued (Unaudited) 
  Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries 

costs directly related to the integration activities of the Chubb Corp acquisition, consisting primarily of personnel-related expenses, including severance and employee retention and relocation; consulting fees; and advisor fees. Chubb integration expenses were $  9 million   for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisting primarily of consulting and legal fees. 
  We recognized goodwill of $  10.5 billion  , attributable to expected growth and profitability, none of which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, indefinite lived intangible assets of $  2.9 billion   and finite lived intangible assets of $  4.8 billion  , which will be amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from   one   to   24   years.  Refer to Note   6   for additional information. 
    
  The following table summarizes the results of the acquired Chubb Corp operations since the acquisition date that have been included within our Consolidated statements of operations:    

The following table provides supplemental unaudited pro forma consolidated information for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, as if Chubb Corp had been acquired as of January 1, 2015.  The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are presented solely for informational purposes and are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that might have been achieved had the transaction been completed as of the date indicated, nor are they meant to be indicative of any anticipated consolidated future results of operations that the combined company will experience after the transaction.    

Total revenues and net income were higher for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior year, principally driven by net realized gains in the current year compared to net realized losses last year, primarily in our variable annuity reinsurance business.  This increase was partially offset by merger-related underwriting actions in the current year, including the purchase of additional reinsurance, which lowered net premiums earned. 
    
  Total revenues and net income were lower for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the merger-related underwriting actions in the current year, as noted above, as well as higher net realized losses in the current year, primarily in our variable annuity reinsurance business. 
    
  Prior year acquisition 
    
  Fireman's Fund Insurance Company High Net Worth Personal Lines Insurance Business in the U.S. (Fireman's Fund)  
  On April 1, 2015, we acquired the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company high net worth personal lines insurance business in the U.S., which included the renewal rights for new and existing business and reinsurance of all existing reserves for   $365 million   in cash. We acquired assets with a fair value of $  753 million  , consisting primarily of cash of $  629 million   and insurance and reinsurance balances receivable of $  124 million  .  We assumed liabilities with a fair value of $  863 million  , consisting primarily of unpaid losses and loss expenses of $  417 million   and unearned premiums of $  428 million  .  This acquisition generated $  196 million   of goodwill, attributable to expected growth and profitability, all of which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, and other intangible assets of $  278 million  , primarily related to renewal rights, based on Chubb s purchase price allocation. During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an adjustment to the valuation of our other intangible assets. The acquisition expanded our position in the high net worth personal lines insurers in the U.S. The Fireman s Fund business was

  Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries 

integrated into our existing high net worth personal lines business, offering a broad range of coverage including homeowners, automobile, umbrella and excess liability, collectibles, and yachts. Goodwill and other intangible assets arising from this acquisition are included in our North America Personal P C Insurance segment. 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include results of acquired businesses from the acquisition dates. 

3  . Investments  
    
  a) Fixed maturities 

As discussed in Note   3     c  ), if a credit loss is incurred on an impaired fixed maturity, an OTTI is considered to have occurred and the portion of the impairment not related to credit losses (non-credit OTTI) is recognized in OCI. Included in the  OTTI Recognized in AOCI  columns above are the cumulative amounts of non-credit OTTI recognized in OCI adjusted for subsequent

     Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   continued (Unaudited) 
  Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries 

sales, maturities, and redemptions. OTTI recognized in AOCI does not include the impact of subsequent changes in fair value of the related securities. In periods subsequent to a recognition of OTTI in OCI, changes in the fair value of the related fixed maturities are reflected in Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in the Consolidated statement of shareholders  equity. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , $  13 million   and $  57 million  , respectively, of net unrealized appreciation related to such securities is included in OCI. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   $4 million   and   nil  , respectively, of net unrealized depreciation related to such securities is included in OCI. At   September 30, 2016  , AOCI included cumulative net unrealized appreciation of   $7   million related to securities remaining in the investment portfolio for which a non-credit OTTI was recognized. At   December 31, 2015  , AOCI included cumulative net unrealized depreciation of   $35   million related to securities remaining in the investment portfolio for which a non-credit OTTI was recognized. 
    
  Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by U.S. government agencies are combined with all other to be announced mortgage derivatives held (refer to Note   8   c) (iv)) and are included in the category,  Mortgage-backed securities .  Approximately   81 percent   of the total mortgage-backed securities at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are represented by investments in U.S. government agency bonds. The remainder of the mortgage exposure consists of collateralized mortgage obligations and non-government mortgage-backed securities, the majority of which provide a planned structure for principal and interest payments and carry a rating of AAA by the major credit rating agencies.

c  ) Net realized gains (losses) 
  In accordance with guidance related to the recognition and presentation of OTTI, when an impairment related to a fixed maturity has occurred, OTTI is required to be recorded in Net income if management has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost. Further, in cases where we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security, Chubb must evaluate the security to determine the portion of the impairment, if any, related to credit losses. If a credit loss is incurred, an OTTI is considered to have occurred and any portion of the OTTI related to credit losses must be reflected in Net income while the portion of OTTI related to all other factors is recognized in OCI. For fixed maturities held to maturity, OTTI recognized in OCI is accreted from AOCI to the amortized cost of the fixed maturity prospectively over the remaining term of the securities. 
    
  Each quarter, securities in an unrealized loss position (impaired securities), including fixed maturities, securities lending collateral, equity securities, and other investments, are reviewed to identify impaired securities to be specifically evaluated for a potential OTTI. 
    
  For all non-fixed maturities, OTTI is evaluated based on the following: 

the amount of time a security has been in a loss position and the magnitude of the loss position; 
                
    the period in which cost is expected to be recovered, if at all, based on various criteria including economic conditions and other issuer-specific developments; and 
                
    Our ability and intent to hold the security to the expected recovery period. 
       
  As a general rule, we also consider that equity securities in an unrealized loss position for twelve consecutive months are other than temporarily impaired. For mutual funds included in equity securities in our consolidated balance sheet, we employ analysis similar to fixed maturities, when applicable. 
    
  We review each fixed maturity in an unrealized loss position to assess whether the security is a candidate for credit loss. Specifically, we consider credit rating, market price, and issuer-specific financial information, among other factors, to assess the likelihood of collection of all principal and interest as contractually due. Securities for which we determine that credit loss is likely are subjected to further analysis to estimate the credit loss recognized in Net income, if any. In general, credit loss recognized in Net income equals the difference between the security s amortized cost and the net present value of its projected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security. All significant assumptions used in determining credit losses are subject to change as market conditions evolve. 
    
  Projected cash flows for corporate securities (principally senior unsecured bonds) are driven primarily by assumptions regarding probability of default and also the timing and amount of recoveries associated with defaults. Chubb developed projected cash flows for corporate securities using market observable data, issuer-specific information, and credit ratings. We use historical default data by Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) rating category to calculate a 1-in-100 year probability of default, which results in a default assumption in excess of the historical mean default rate. Consistent with management's approach, Chubb assumed a   32   percent recovery rate (the par value of a defaulted security that will be recovered) across all rating categories rather than using Moody's historical mean recovery rate of   42   percent. We believe that use of a default assumption in excess of the historical mean is conservative in light of current market conditions. 
    
  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , credit losses recognized in Net income for corporate securities were   $4 million   and $  28 million  , respectively. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , credit losses recognized in Net income for corporate securities were   $14 million   and $  23 million  , respectively. 
    
  For mortgage-backed securities, credit impairment is assessed using a cash flow model that estimates the cash flows on the underlying mortgages, using the security-specific collateral and transaction structure. The model estimates cash flows from the underlying mortgage loans and distributes those cash flows to various tranches of securities, considering the transaction structure and any subordination and credit enhancements that exist in that structure. The cash flow model incorporates actual cash flows on the mortgage-backed securities through the current period and then projects the remaining cash flows using a number of assumptions, including default rates, prepayment rates, and loss severity rates (the par value of a defaulted security that will not be recovered) on foreclosed properties.

d) Gross unrealized loss 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   3,376   fixed maturities out of a total of   31,902   fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position. The largest single unrealized loss in the fixed maturities was   $2 million  . There were   73   equity securities out of a total of   326   equity securities in an unrealized loss position. The largest single unrealized loss in the equity securities was   $3 million  . Fixed maturities in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016  , comprised both investment grade and below investment grade securities for which fair value declined primarily due to widening credit spreads since the date of purchase.  
    
  The following tables present, for all securities in an unrealized loss position (including securities on loan), the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time the security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position: 

e) Restricted assets 
  Chubb is required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support its insurance and reinsurance operations. These requirements are generally promulgated in the statutory regulations of the individual jurisdictions. The assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Chubb is also required to restrict assets pledged under repurchase agreements, which represent Chubb's agreement to sell securities and repurchase them at a future date for a predetermined price. We also use trust funds in certain large reinsurance transactions where the trust funds are set up for the benefit of the ceding companies and generally take the place of letter of credit (LOC) requirements. We also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for LOC and derivative transactions. Included in restricted assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are investments, primarily fixed maturities, totaling   $19.4   billion and   $16.9   billion, respectively, and cash of   $162   million and   $110   million, respectively.

The following table presents the components of restricted assets:   

4  . Fair value measurements 
    
  a  ) Fair value hierarchy 
  Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is estimated based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data. 
    
  The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 
                
    Level 2   Includes, among other items, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as 
     interest rates and yield curves, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; and 
             
    Level 3   Inputs that are unobservable and reflect management s judgments about assumptions that market participants 
     would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
    
  We categorize financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy at the balance sheet date based upon the lowest level of inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement. Accordingly, transfers between levels within the valuation hierarchy occur when there are significant changes to the inputs, such as increases or decreases in market activity, changes to the availability of current prices, changes to the transparency to underlying inputs, and whether there are significant variances in quoted prices. Transfers in and/or out of any level are assumed to occur at the end of the period. 
    
  We use pricing services to obtain fair value measurements for the majority of our investment securities. Based on management s understanding of the methodologies used, these pricing services only produce an estimate of fair value if there is observable market information that would allow them to make a fair value estimate. Based on our understanding of the market inputs used by the pricing services, all applicable investments have been valued in accordance with GAAP. We do not adjust prices obtained from pricing services. The following is a description of the valuation techniques and inputs used to determine fair values for financial instruments carried at fair value, as well as the general classification of such financial instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
    
  Fixed maturities 
  We use pricing services to estimate fair value measurements for the majority of our fixed maturities. The pricing services use market quotations for fixed maturities that have quoted prices in active markets; such securities are classified within Level 1. For fixed maturities other than U.S. Treasury securities that generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing services prepare estimates of fair value measurements using their pricing applications, which include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. Additional valuation factors that can be taken into account are nominal spreads, dollar basis, and liquidity adjustments. The pricing services evaluate each asset class based on relevant market and credit information, perceived market movements, and sector news. The market inputs used in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. The extent of the use of each input is dependent on the asset class and the market conditions. Given the asset class, the priority of the use of inputs may change, or some market inputs may not be relevant. Additionally, fixed maturities valuation is  

17 

Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   continued (Unaudited) 
  Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries 

more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs (i.e., stale pricing), which may increase the potential that an investment's estimated fair value is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur. The overwhelming majority of fixed maturities are classified within Level 2 because the most significant inputs used in the pricing techniques are observable. For a small number of fixed maturities, we obtain a single broker quote (typically from a market maker). Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, we include these fair value estimates in Level 3.  
    
  Equity securities 
  Equity securities with active markets are classified within Level 1 as fair values are based on quoted market prices. For equity securities in markets which are less active, fair values are based on market valuations and are classified within Level 2. Equity securities for which pricing is unobservable are classified within Level 3. 
    
  Short-term investments 
  Short-term investments, which comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of purchase that are traded in active markets, are classified within Level 1 as fair values are based on quoted market prices. Securities such as commercial paper and discount notes are classified within Level 2 because these securities are typically not actively traded due to their approaching maturity and, as such, their cost approximates fair value. Short-term investments for which pricing is unobservable are classified within Level 3. 
    
  Other investments 
  Fair values for the majority of Other investments including investments in partially-owned investment companies, investment funds, and limited partnerships are based on their respective net asset values or equivalent (NAV) and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy table below.  Certain of our long-duration contracts are supported by assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP. These assets comprise mutual funds classified within Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy on the same basis as other equity securities traded in active markets. Other investments also include equity securities classified within Level 1, and fixed maturities, classified within Level 2, held in rabbi trusts maintained by Chubb for deferred compensation plans, and are classified within the valuation hierarchy on the same basis as other equity securities and fixed maturities. Other investments for which pricing is unobservable are classified within Level 3. 
    
  Securities lending collateral 
  The underlying assets included in Securities lending collateral in the consolidated balance sheets are fixed maturities which are classified in the valuation hierarchy on the same basis as other fixed maturities. Excluded from the valuation hierarchy is the corresponding liability related to Chubb s obligation to return the collateral plus interest as it is reported at contract value and not fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Investment derivative instruments 
  Actively traded investment derivative instruments, including futures, options, and forward contracts are classified within Level 1 as fair values are based on quoted market prices. The fair value of cross-currency swaps are based on market valuations and are classified within Level 2. Investment derivative instruments are recorded in either Other assets or Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Other derivative instruments 
  We generally maintain positions in other derivative instruments including exchange-traded equity futures contracts and option contracts designed to limit exposure to a severe equity market decline, which would cause an increase in expected claims and, therefore, an increase in reserves for our guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) and guaranteed living benefits (GLB) reinsurance business. Our position in exchange-traded equity futures contracts is classified within Level 1. At   September 30, 2016  , we held   no   positions in option contracts on equity market indices. The fair value of the majority of the remaining positions in other derivative instruments is based on significant observable inputs including equity security and interest rate indices. Accordingly, these are classified within Level 2. Other derivative instruments based on unobservable inputs are classified within Level 3. Other derivative instruments are recorded in either Other assets or Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Separate account assets 
  Separate account assets represent segregated funds where investment risks are borne by the customers, except to the extent of certain guarantees made by Chubb. Separate account assets comprise mutual funds classified within Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy on the same basis as other equity securities traded in active markets. Separate account assets also include fixed maturities classified within Level 2 because the most significant inputs used in the pricing techniques are observable. Excluded

from the valuation hierarchy are the corresponding liabilities as they are reported at contract value and not fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Separate account assets are recorded in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Guaranteed living benefits 
  The GLB arises from life reinsurance programs covering living benefit guarantees whereby we assume the risk of guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB) and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (GMAB) associated with variable annuity contracts. GLB s are recorded in Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities and Future policy benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. For GLB reinsurance, Chubb estimates fair value using an internal valuation model which includes current market information and estimates of policyholder behavior. All of the treaties contain claim limits, which are factored into the valuation model. The fair value depends on a number of factors, including interest rates, equity markets, credit risk, current account value, market volatility, expected annuitization rates and other policyholder behavior, and changes in policyholder mortality. 
    
  The most significant policyholder behavior assumptions include lapse rates and the GMIB annuitization rates. Assumptions regarding lapse rates and GMIB annuitization rates differ by treaty, but the underlying methodologies to determine rates applied to each treaty are comparable.  
    
  A lapse rate is the percentage of in-force policies surrendered in a given calendar year. All else equal, as lapse rates increase, ultimate claim payments will decrease. 
    
  GMIB annuitization rate is the percentage of policies for which the policyholder will elect to annuitize using the guaranteed benefit provided under the GMIB. All else equal, as GMIB annuitization rates increase, ultimate claim payments will increase, subject to treaty claim limits. 
    
  The effect of changes in key market factors on assumed lapse and annuitization rates reflect emerging trends using data available from cedants. For treaties with limited experience, rates are established in line with data received from other ceding companies adjusted, as appropriate, with industry estimates. The model and related assumptions are regularly re-evaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of updated information such as market conditions, market participant assumptions, and demographics of in-force annuities. Because of the significant use of unobservable inputs including policyholder behavior, GLB reinsurance is classified within Level 3. For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, no material technical refinements were made to the model. For detailed information on our lapse and annuitization rate assumptions, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our   2015   Form 10-K.

Investment funds 
  Chubb s investment funds employ various investment strategies such as long/short equity and arbitrage/distressed. Included in this category are investments for which Chubb has the option to redeem at agreed upon value as described in each investment fund s subscription agreement. Depending on the terms of the various subscription agreements, investment fund investments may be redeemed monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. If Chubb wishes to redeem an investment fund investment, it must first determine if the investment fund is still in a lock-up period (a time when Chubb cannot redeem its investment so that the investment fund manager has time to build the portfolio). If the investment fund is no longer in its lock-up period, Chubb must then notify the investment fund manager of its intention to redeem by the notification date prescribed by the subscription agreement. Subsequent to notification, the investment fund can redeem Chubb s investment within several months of the notification. Notice periods for redemption of the investment funds range between   5   and   120   days. Chubb can redeem its investment funds without consent from the investment fund managers. 
    
  Level 3 financial instruments 
  The fair values of assets and liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) consist of various inputs and assumptions that management makes when determining fair value. Management analyzes changes in fair value measurements classified within Level 3 by comparing pricing and returns of our investments to benchmarks, including month-over-month movements, investment credit spreads, interest rate movements, and credit quality of securities.

  The reported liability for GMDB reinsurance was   $119   million and $  117 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the reported liability for GLB reinsurance was   $1.2   billion and   $888   million, respectively, which includes a fair value derivative adjustment of $  883   million and   $609   million, respectively. Reported liabilities for both GMDB and GLB reinsurance are determined using internal valuation models. Such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty. The valuation of these products is subject to fluctuations arising from, among other factors, changes in interest rates, changes in equity markets, changes in credit markets, changes in the allocation of the investments underlying annuitants  account values, and assumptions regarding future policyholder behavior. These models and the related assumptions are regularly reviewed by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling assumptions and availability of updated information, such as market conditions and demographics of in-force annuities.

Additionally, in connection with the Chubb Corp acquisition, we recorded an increase to Unpaid losses and loss expenses acquired as part of Chubb Corp of $  715 million   to adjust the carrying value of Chubb Corp's historical unpaid losses and loss expenses to fair value as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value consists of the present value of the expected net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses payments adjusted for an estimated risk margin. The expected cash flows are discounted at a risk free rate. The estimated risk margin varies based on the inherent risks associated with each type of reserve. This fair value adjustment was recorded within Unpaid losses and loss expenses on the Consolidated balance sheets and will amortize through Amortization of purchased intangibles on the Consolidated statements of operations over a range of   5   to   17   years, based on the estimated payout patterns of unpaid loss and loss expenses as of the acquisition date. 
    
  The following table presents, as of   September 30, 2016  , the expected estimated pre-tax amortization expense (benefit), at current foreign currency exchange rates, for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the next five years, related to purchased intangibles as well as the fair value adjustment to Unpaid losses and loss expenses described above: 

The expected amortization, at current foreign currency exchange rates, for the remainder of the UPR intangible asset which amortizes through Policy acquisition costs on the Consolidated statements of operations is $  144 million   for the fourth quarter of 2016. 

7  . Debt 
  In connection with the Chubb Corp acquisition, Chubb INA Holdings Inc. (formerly ACE INA Holdings Inc.) assumed $  3.3 billion   par value outstanding debt of Chubb Corp, fair valued at $  3.8 billion   at the acquisition date. Chubb INA Holdings Inc. (Chubb INA) assumed Chubb Corp's rights, duties and obligations and Chubb Limited fully and unconditionally guarantees Chubb INA's payment obligations under these debts.  Additionally, during the first quarter of 2016 we adopted new guidance that required debt issuance costs be recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of the related debt liability (these costs

were previously included in Other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets). The debt balances at December 31, 2015 have been updated to reflect the adoption of this guidance. 

(2)   
    Redemption price is equal to accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date plus the greater of (i) 100 percent of the principal amount thereof, or (ii) sum of present value of scheduled payments of principal and interest on the debentures from the redemption date to April 1, 2030. 
       
  Certain of Chubb INA's senior notes and capital securities are redeemable at any time at Chubb INA's option subject to the provisions described in the table above.  A "make-whole" premium is the present value of the remaining principal and interest

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   continued (Unaudited) 
  Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries 

discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate.  The senior notes and capital securities are also redeemable at par plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of certain changes in tax law.  
  We have outstanding $  1.0 billion   of unsecured junior subordinated capital securities at   September 30, 2016  , which were assumed by Chubb INA in connection with the Chubb Corp acquisition.  The capital securities will become due on April 15, 2037, the scheduled maturity date, but only to the extent that we have received sufficient net proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying capital securities. We must use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to certain market disruption events, to sell enough qualifying capital securities to permit repayment of the capital securities on the scheduled maturity date or as soon thereafter as possible.  Any remaining outstanding principal amount will be due on March 29, 2067, the final maturity date.  The capital securities bear interest at a rate of   6.375   percent through April 14, 2017.  Thereafter, the capital securities will bear interest at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus   2.25   percent.  Subject to certain conditions, we have the right to defer the payment of interest on the capital securities for a period not exceeding ten consecutive years.  During any such period, interest will continue to accrue and we generally may not declare or pay any dividends on or purchase any shares of our capital stock.  
  In connection with the issuance of capital securities, a replacement capital covenant was entered into in which we agreed that we will not repay, redeem, or purchase capital securities before March 29, 2047, unless, subject to certain limitations, we have received proceeds from the sale of specified replacement capital securities.  The replacement capital covenant is not intended for the benefit of holders of the capital securities and may not be enforced by them.  The replacement capital covenant is for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of Chubb's indebtedness, which initially was and continues to be its   6.8   percent debentures due November 2031. 
  Subject to the replacement capital covenant, the $  1.0 billion   capital securities may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time (i) on or after April 15, 2017 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus any accrued interest or (ii) prior to April 15, 2017 at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) the principal amount or (2) a make-whole premium, in each case plus any accrued interest. 

8  . Commitments, contingencies, and guarantees 
    
  a)   Derivative instruments 
  Foreign currency management  
  As a global company,   Chubb   entities transact business in multiple currencies. Our policy is to generally match assets, liabilities, and required capital for each individual jurisdiction in local currency, which would include the use of derivatives discussed below. We do not hedge our net asset non-U.S. dollar capital positions; however, we do consider hedging for planned cross border transactions. 
    
  Derivative instruments employed 
  Chubb   maintains positions in derivative instruments such as futures, options, swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts for which the primary purposes are to manage duration and foreign currency exposure, yield enhancement, or to obtain an exposure to a particular financial market.   Chubb   also maintains positions in convertible securities that contain embedded derivatives.  Investment derivative instruments are recorded in either Other assets (OA) or Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities (AP), convertible bonds are recorded in Fixed maturities available for sale (FM AFS), and convertible equity securities are recorded in Equity securities (ES) in the consolidated balance sheets.  These are the most numerous and frequent derivative transactions. 
    
  In addition,   Chubb   from time to time purchases to be announced mortgage-backed securities (TBAs) as part of its investing activities.  
    
  Under reinsurance programs covering GLBs, Chubb assumes the risk of GLBs, including GMIB and GMAB, associated with variable annuity contracts. The GMIB risk is triggered if, at the time the contract holder elects to convert the accumulated account value to a periodic payment stream (annuitize), the accumulated account value is not sufficient to provide a guaranteed minimum level of monthly income. The GMAB risk is triggered if, at contract maturity, the contract holder s account value is less than a guaranteed minimum value. The GLB reinsurance product meets the definition of a derivative instrument. Benefit reserves in respect of GLBs are classified as Future policy benefits (FPB) while the fair value derivative adjustment is classified within AP. Chubb also generally maintains positions in exchange-traded equity futures contracts and options on equity market indices to limit equity exposure in the GMDB and GLB blocks of business. At   September 30, 2016  , we held   no   positions in option contracts on equity market indices.

All derivative instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Net realized gains (losses) in the Consolidated statements of operations. None of the derivative instruments are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. 
    
  The following table presents the balance sheet locations, fair values of derivative instruments in an asset or (liability) position, and notional values/payment provisions of our derivative instruments: 

(1)   
    Includes fair value of embedded derivatives. 
               (2)   
    Related to GMDB and GLB blocks of business. 
               (3)   
    Includes both future policy benefits reserves and fair value derivative adjustment. Refer to Note   5   for additional information. Note that the payment provision related to GLB is the net amount at risk. The concept of a notional value does not apply to the GLB reinsurance contracts. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, derivative assets of   $9 million   and   $1 million  , respectively, included in the table above were subject to a master netting agreement. The remaining derivatives included in the table above were not subject to a master netting agreement.   
    
  b) Secured borrowings 
  Chubb participates in a securities lending program operated by a third-party banking institution whereby certain assets are loaned to qualified borrowers and from which we earn an incremental return. At     September 30, 2016     and December 31, 2015, our securities lending collateral was     $1,140     million and     $1,046     million, respectively, and our securities lending payable,     reflecting our obligation to return the collateral plus interest,   was     $1,141     million and     $1,047     million, respectively. The securities lending collateral can only be drawn down by Chubb in the event that the institution borrowing the securities is in default under the lending agreement. An indemnification agreement with the lending agent protects us in the event a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to return any of the securities on loan.     The collateral is recorded in Securities lending collateral and the liability is recorded in Securities lending payable in the consolidated balance sheets.

    The carrying value of the securities lending collateral held is $  1 million   lower than the securities lending payable due to accrued interest recorded in the securities lending payable.  
       
  At     September 30, 2016     and December 31, 2015, our repurchase agreement obligations of     $1,406 million     and     $1,404 million  , respectively, were fully collateralized. In contrast to securities lending programs, the use of cash received is not restricted for the repurchase obligations.     The fair value of the underlying securities sold remains in Fixed maturities available for sale and Equity securities and the repurchase agreement obligation is recorded in Repurchase agreements in the consolidated balance sheets.   
    
  The following table presents the carrying value of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements by investment category and remaining contractual maturity of the underlying agreements: 

(1)   
    Per the repurchase agreements, the amount of collateral posted is required to exceed the amount of gross liability. 
       
  Potential risks exist in our secured borrowing transactions due to market conditions and counterparty exposure. With collateral that we pledge, there is a risk that the collateral may not be returned at the expiration of the agreement. If the counterparty fails to return the collateral, Chubb will have free use of the borrowed funds until our collateral is returned. In addition, we may encounter the risk that Chubb may not be able to renew outstanding borrowings with a new term or with an existing counterparty due to market conditions including a decrease in demand as well as more restrictive terms from banks due to increased regulatory and capital constraints. Should this condition occur, Chubb may seek alternative borrowing sources or reduce borrowings. Additionally, increased margins and collateral requirements due to market conditions would increase our restricted assets as we are required to provide additional collateral to support the transaction.

The following table presents net realized gains (losses) related to derivative instrument activity in the Consolidated statements of operations: 

(1)   
    Includes embedded derivatives. 
               (2)   
    Excludes foreign exchange gains (losses) related to GLB. 
               (3)   
    Related to GMDB and GLB blocks of business. 
       
  c) Derivative instrument objectives 
  (i) Foreign currency exposure management 
  A foreign currency forward contract (forward) is an agreement between participants to exchange specific foreign currencies at a future date.   Chubb   uses forwards to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies as discussed above. 
    
  (ii) Duration management and market exposure 
  Futures 
  Futures contracts give the holder the right and obligation to participate in market movements, determined by the index or underlying security on which the futures contract is based. Settlement is made daily in cash by an amount equal to the change in value of the futures contract times a multiplier that scales the size of the contract. Exchange-traded futures contracts on money market instruments, notes and bonds are used in fixed maturity portfolios to more efficiently manage duration, as substitutes for ownership of the money market instruments, bonds and notes without significantly increasing the risk in the portfolio. Investments in futures contracts may be made only to the extent that there are assets under management not otherwise committed. 
    
  Exchange-traded equity futures contracts are used to limit exposure to a severe equity market decline, which would cause an increase in expected claims and therefore, an increase in reserves for GMDB and GLB reinsurance business. 
    
  Options 
  An option contract conveys to the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a specified amount or value of an underlying security at a fixed price. Option contracts are used in the investment portfolio as protection against unexpected shifts in interest rates, which would affect the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio. By using options in the portfolio, the overall interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio can be reduced. Option contracts may also be used as an alternative to futures contracts in the synthetic strategy as described above. 
    
  Another use for option contracts is to limit exposure to a severe equity market decline, which would cause an increase in expected claims and therefore, an increase in reserves for GMDB and GLB reinsurance business. 
    
  The price of an option is influenced by the underlying security, expected volatility, time to expiration, and supply and demand. 
    
  The credit risk associated with the above derivative financial instruments relates to the potential for non-performance by counterparties. Although non-performance is not anticipated, in order to minimize the risk of loss, management monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties and obtains collateral. The performance of exchange-traded instruments is guaranteed by  

33 

Table of Contents  
    
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   continued (Unaudited) 
  Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries 

the exchange on which they trade. For non-exchange-traded instruments, the counterparties are principally banks which must meet certain criteria according to our investment guidelines. 
    
  Cross-currency swaps 
  Cross-currency swaps are agreements under which two counterparties exchange interest payments and principal denominated in different currencies at a future date.  We use cross-currency swaps to reduce the foreign currency and interest rate risk by converting cash flows back into local currency.  We invest in foreign currency denominated investments to improve credit diversification and also to obtain better duration matching to our liabilities that is limited in the local currency market.  
    
  Other 
  Included within Other are derivatives intended to reduce potential losses which may arise from certain exposures in our insurance business.  The economic benefit provided by these derivatives is similar to purchased reinsurance.  For example,   Chubb   may enter into crop derivative contracts to protect underwriting results in the event of a significant decline in commodity prices. Also included within Other are certain life insurance products that meet the definition of a derivative instrument for accounting purposes.   
    
  (iii) Convertible security investments 
  A convertible security is a debt instrument or preferred stock that can be converted into a predetermined amount of the issuer s equity. The convertible option is an embedded derivative within the host instruments which are classified in the investment portfolio as either available for sale or as an equity security.   Chubb   purchases convertible securities for their total return and not specifically for the conversion feature. 
    
  (iv) TBA 
  By acquiring TBAs, we make a commitment to purchase a future issuance of mortgage-backed securities. For the period between purchase of the TBAs and issuance of the underlying security, we account for our position as a derivative in the consolidated financial statements. Chubb purchases TBAs both for their total return and for the flexibility they provide related to our mortgage-backed security strategy. 
    
  (v) GLB 
  Under the GLB program, as the assuming entity,   Chubb   is obligated to provide coverage until the expiration or maturity of the underlying deferred annuity contracts or the expiry of the reinsurance treaty. Premiums received under the reinsurance treaties are classified as premium. Expected losses allocated to premiums received are classified as Future policy benefits and valued similar to GMDB reinsurance. Other changes in fair value, principally arising from changes in expected losses allocated to expected future premiums, are classified as Net realized gains (losses). Fair value represents management s estimate of an exit price and thus, includes a risk margin. We may recognize a realized loss for other changes in fair value due to adverse changes in the capital markets (e.g., declining interest rates and/or declining equity markets) and changes in actual or estimated future policyholder behavior (e.g., increased annuitization or decreased lapse rates) although we expect the business to be profitable. We believe this presentation provides the most meaningful disclosure of changes in the underlying risk within the GLB reinsurance programs for a given reporting period. 
    
  d) Fixed maturities 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we have commitments to purchase fixed income securities of   $788 million   over the next several years. 
    
  e) Other investments 
  At   September 30, 2016  , included in Other investments in the consolidated balance sheet are investments in limited partnerships and partially-owned investment companies with a carrying value of   $3.3   billion. In connection with these investments, we have commitments that may require funding of up to   $2.0   billion over the next several years. 
    
  f) Taxation 
  In September, the IRS completed its examination of one of our subsidiary s federal tax returns for the 2010-2012 tax years.  No material adjustments resulted from this examination. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $17 million   of unrecognized tax benefits remains outstanding. It is reasonably possible that over the next twelve months, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change resulting from the re-evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits arising from examinations of taxing authorities. With few exceptions,   Chubb   is no longer subject to state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2006.

g) Legal proceedings 
  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims litigation involving disputed interpretations of policy coverages and, in some jurisdictions, direct actions by allegedly-injured persons seeking damages from policyholders. These lawsuits, involving claims on policies issued by our subsidiaries which are typical to the insurance industry in general and in the normal course of business, are considered in our loss and loss expense reserves. In addition to claims litigation, we are subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions in the normal course of business that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on insurance policies. This category of business litigation typically involves, among other things, allegations of underwriting errors or misconduct, employment claims, regulatory activity, or disputes arising from our business ventures. In the opinion of management, our ultimate liability for these matters could be, but we believe is not likely to be, material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 

9  . Shareholders  equity 
    
  All of Chubb s Common Shares are authorized under Swiss corporate law. Though the par value of Common Shares is stated in Swiss francs, Chubb continues to use U.S. dollars as its reporting currency for preparing consolidated financial statements. Under Swiss corporate law, dividends, including distributions through a reduction in par value (par value reduction) or from legal reserves, must be stated in Swiss francs though dividend payments are made by Chubb in U.S. dollars. At September 30, 2016, our Common Shares had a par value of CHF   24.15   per share.  
    
  At our May 2014 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of   $2.60   per share, payable in four quarterly installments of   $0.65   per share after the annual general meeting in the form of a distribution by way of a par value reduction.  
    
  At our May 2015 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $  2.68   per share, which was paid in four quarterly installments of $  0.67   per share at dates determined by the Board of Directors (Board) after the annual general meeting by way of a distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment.  
    
  At our May 2016 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $  2.76   per share, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $  0.69   per share after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. The Board will determine the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2017 annual general meeting, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at their discretion.  
    
  The following table presents dividend distributions per Common Share in Swiss francs (CHF) and U.S. dollars (USD): 

Common Shares in treasury are used principally for issuance upon the exercise of employee stock options, grants of restricted stock, and purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). At   September 30, 2016  ,   14,497,754   Common Shares remain in treasury after net shares redeemed under employee share-based compensation plans. 
    
  Chubb Limited securities repurchase authorization 
  In November 2014, the Board authorized a share repurchase program of   $1.5 billion   of Chubb's Common Shares for the period January 1, 2015 through   December 31, 2015  . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, Chubb repurchased   nil   and   $734 million   (  6,677,663   Common Shares), respectively. There are   no   outstanding repurchase authorizations subsequent to December 31, 2015.

10  . Share-based compensation 
    
  The ACE Limited 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2004 LTIP) permitted grants of both incentive and non-qualified stock options principally at an option price per share equal to the grant date fair value of Chubb's Common Shares. Stock options are generally granted with a 3-year vesting period and a 10-year term. Stock options typically vest in equal annual installments over the vesting period, which is also the requisite service period. On   February 25, 2016  , Chubb granted   1,926,842   stock options with a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $21.52   each. The fair value of the options issued is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
    
  The 2004 LTIP also permitted grants of service-based restricted stock and restricted stock units as well as performance-based restricted stock awards. Chubb generally grants service-based restricted stock and restricted stock units with a 4-year vesting period, based on a graded vesting schedule. The performance-based stock awards comprise target awards which have four installments that vest annually based on tangible book value (shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets) per share growth compared to a defined group of peer companies, and premium awards, which are earned only if tangible book value per share growth over the cumulative 4-year period after the grant of the associated target awards exceeds a higher threshold compared to our peer group. The restricted stock is granted at market close price on the grant date. On   February 25, 2016  , Chubb granted   1,119,686   service-based restricted stock awards,   337,581   service-based restricted stock units, and   452,820   performance-based stock awards to employees and officers with a grant date fair value of   $118.39   each. Each restricted stock unit represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one Common Share upon vesting.  
    
  In connection with the Chubb Corp acquisition, we assumed outstanding equity awards consisting of service-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, and stock options issued by Chubb Corporation to employees and directors with a fair value of approximately   $525 million  , of which   $323 million   is attributed to purchase consideration for the acquisition. These awards were generally granted with a 3-year vesting period, and the stock options generally have a 10-year term. 
    
  In May 2016, our shareholders approved the Chubb Limited 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2016 LTIP), which replaced both the 2004 LTIP and The Chubb Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (2014). The 2016 LTIP is substantially similar to the 2004 LTIP in its operation and the types of awards that may be granted. 
    
  Under the 2016 LTIP,   19,500,000   Common Shares were authorized to be issued, in addition to any shares that have not been delivered pursuant to the 2004 LTIP and remain available for grant pursuant to the 2004 LTIP, including any shares covered by awards granted under the 2004 LTIP that are forfeited, expire, or are canceled after the effective date of the 2016 LTIP without delivery of shares or which result in the forfeiture of the shares back to Chubb. 

11. Postretirement benefits 
    
  We maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans that cover certain employees located in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Canada, and Mexico. All underlying plans are subject to periodic actuarial valuations by qualified actuarial firms using actuarial models to calculate the expense and liability for each plan. Components of the funded status of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  Chubb provides postretirement benefits to eligible employees and their dependents through various defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans sponsored by Chubb. With the acquisition, Chubb assumed the outstanding pension obligations of legacy Chubb Corp, which consisted of several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all its employees.  
    
  We also assumed legacy Chubb Corp other postretirement benefits plans, principally health care and life insurance, to retired employees, their beneficiaries, and covered dependents. Health care coverage is contributory.  Retiree contributions vary based upon retiree s age, type of coverage, and years of service requirements. Life insurance coverage is non-contributory. Chubb funds a portion of the health care benefits obligation where such funding can be accomplished on a tax-effective basis. Benefits are paid as covered expenses are incurred.   
    
  As part of purchase accounting, Chubb eliminated legacy Chubb Corp s postretirement benefit costs not yet recognized in Net income that were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income at the time of the acquisition. In addition, Chubb conformed the accounting policies for the acquired plans of legacy Chubb Corp to the accounting policies of Chubb, including  

36 

     Table of Contents

  Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries 

selecting the applicable discount rates using specific spot rates along a yield curve determined by the projected cash flows assumptions. This resulted in a lower overall discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation and therefore increased that obligation at the date of the acquisition. 
    
  At the date of the acquisition of Chubb Corp, we assumed the following postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations: 

Chubb s funding policy is to contribute amounts that meet regulatory requirements plus additional amounts determined based on actuarial valuations, market conditions and other factors. All benefit plans satisfy minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  
    
  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we contributed $  24 million   and $  156 million  , respectively, to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans.  At   September 30, 2016  , we estimate that we will contribute an additional $  8 million   for the remainder of 2016. These estimates are subject to change due to contribution decisions that are affected by various factors including our liquidity, market performance and management discretion. 
    
  The following tables summarize the components of net periodic benefit costs for our pension and postretirement benefit plans recognized in the Consolidated statements of operations:

12  . Segment information 
    
  Effective the first quarter of 2016, we are reporting our financial results within the following business segments: North America Commercial P C Insurance, North America Personal P C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance. We have also redefined Corporate to include all run-off asbestos and environmental (A E) exposures, the results of run-off Brandywine business, the results of Westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years and certain other run-off exposures. All legacy ACE prior period amounts (i.e., legacy Chubb Corp prior period results are not included in the prior period amounts in the tables below) have been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. 

The North America Commercial P C Insurance segment includes the business written by Chubb divisions that provide property and casualty (P C) insurance and services to large, middle market and small commercial businesses in the U.S., Bermuda and Canada. These divisions write a variety of coverages, including traditional commercial property, marine,

general casualty, workers  compensation, package policies, and risk management; specialty categories such as professional lines, marine and construction risk, environmental and cyber risk, excess casualty, as well as group accident and health (A H) insurance. This segment includes our North American Major Accounts and Specialty Insurance (principally large corporate accounts and wholesale business), and the Commercial Insurance divisions (principally middle market and small commercial accounts). 

The North America Personal P C Insurance segment includes the business written by Chubb s North America Personal Risk Services division, which comprises Chubb high net worth personal lines business and ACE Private Risk Services, with operations in U.S. and Canada. This segment provides affluent and high net worth individuals and families with homeowners, automobile, valuables, umbrella and recreational marine insurance and services. 

The North America Agricultural Insurance segment includes the business written by Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc. which provides comprehensive multiple peril crop and crop-hail insurance, and Chubb Agribusiness, which offers farm and ranch property as well as specialty P C coverages, including commercial agriculture products. 

The Overseas General Insurance segment includes the business written by two Chubb divisions that provide P C insurance and services in the 51 countries outside of North America where the company operates.  Chubb International provides commercial P C traditional and specialty lines serving large corporations, middle market and small customers, A H and traditional and specialty personal lines through retail brokers, agents and other channels locally around the world. Chubb Global Markets provides commercial P C excess and surplus lines and A H through wholesale brokers in the London market and through Lloyd s.  These divisions write a variety of coverages, including traditional commercial property and casualty, specialty categories such as financial lines, marine, energy, aviation, political risk and construction risk, as well as group A H and traditional and specialty personal lines.  

The Global Reinsurance segment primarily includes the reinsurance business written by Chubb Tempest Re as well as the legacy Chubb U.K. Assumed Reinsurance business, which is active, and the legacy Chubb Corp run-off Reinsurance business. 

The Life Insurance segment includes the business written by Chubb Life, Chubb Tempest Life Re and Combined Insurance s North America operations. 
       
  Corporate primarily includes loss and loss expenses of asbestos and environmental (A E) run-off liabilities, and the results of our non-insurance companies including Chubb Limited, Chubb Group Management and Holdings Ltd, and Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. Our exposure to A E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA s P C business in 1999, legacy Chubb Corp run-off business in 2016, and certain other run-off exposures.  
    
  In addition, revenue and expenses managed at the corporate level, including realized gains and losses, interest expense, the non-operating income of our partially-owned entities, and income taxes are reported within Corporate. Chubb integration expenses and other merger-related expenses (both included in Chubb integration expenses in the consolidated statements of operations) are also reported within Corporate. Chubb integration expenses are one-time costs that are directly attributable to the achievement of the annualized savings, including employee severance, third-party consulting fees, and systems integration expenses. Other merger-related expenses are one-time costs directly attributable to the merger, including rebranding, employee retention costs and other professional and legal fees related to the Chubb Corp acquisition. These items will not be allocated to the segment level as they are one-time in nature and are not related to the ongoing business activities of the segment. The Chief Executive Officer does not manage segment results or allocate resources to segments when considering these costs and they are therefore excluded from our definition of segment income. Therefore, the segment income statement will only include underwriting income, net investment income, and other operating income and expense items such as each segment's share of the operating income (loss) related to partially-owned entities and miscellaneous income and expense items for which the segments are held accountable. Beginning with the third quarter of 2016, segment income also included amortization of purchased intangibles related to business combination intangible assets acquired by the segment and other purchase accounting related intangible assets, including agency relationships, renewal rights, and client lists. These costs were previously included in Corporate. The amortization of intangible assets purchased as part of the Chubb Corp acquisition is considered a Corporate cost as these are incurred by the overall company. We determined that this definition of segment income is appropriate and aligns with how the business is managed.  The prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation. As we progress through the integration and refine our processes, we may continue to further refine our segments and segment income measures.

For segment reporting purposes, certain items have been presented in a different manner below than in the consolidated financial statements. Management uses underwriting income as the main measure of segment performance. Chubb calculates underwriting income by subtracting Losses and loss expenses, Policy benefits, Policy acquisition costs, and Administrative expenses from Net premiums earned. To calculate segment income, include net investment income, the operating portion of other (income) expense,     and amortization of purchased intangibles. For the North America Agricultural Insurance segment, management includes gains and losses on crop derivatives as a component of underwriting income. For example, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, underwriting income in our North America Agricultural Insurance segment was   $90 million  .  This amount includes   $3 million   of realized gains related to crop derivatives which are reported in Net realized gains (losses) in the Corporate column below. 
    
  For the Life Insurance segment, management includes Net investment income and (Gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP as components of Life Insurance underwriting income. For example, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, Life underwriting income of   $72 million   includes Net investment income of   $71 million   and gains from fair value changes in separate account assets of   $22 million  . The gains from fair value changes in separate account assets are reported in other (income) expense in the table below.

  The following tables present condensed consolidating financial information at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   for Chubb Limited (Parent Guarantor) and Chubb INA Holdings Inc. (Subsidiary Issuer). The transactions noted above are reflected in the tables below. The Subsidiary Issuer is an indirect 100 percent-owned subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor. The Parent Guarantor fully and unconditionally guarantees certain of the debt of the Subsidiary Issuer. Condensed consolidating financial information of the Parent Guarantor and Subsidiary Issuer are presented on the equity method of accounting.

Overview 

Chubb Limited is the Swiss-incorporated holding company of the Chubb Group of Companies. Chubb Limited, which is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Chubb Group of Companies, Chubb, we, us, or our) are a global insurance and reinsurance organization, serving the needs of a diverse group of clients worldwide. At   September 30, 2016  , we had total assets of   $162 billion   and shareholders  equity of   $48 billion  . Chubb was incorporated in 1985 at which time it opened its first business office in Bermuda and continues to maintain operations in Bermuda. 
    
  On January 14, 2016, we completed the acquisition of The Chubb Corporation (Chubb Corp), creating a global leader in property and casualty insurance. We have changed our name from ACE Limited to Chubb Limited and plan to adopt the Chubb name globally, although some subsidiaries may continue to use ACE as part of their names.  
    
  Products and Services 
             
    We are a global leader in traditional and specialty P C coverage for industrial, commercial and mid-market companies with claims and risk engineering capabilities to serve companies of all sizes. Our commercial P C business is focused on large corporate customers that are served by retail brokers, middle market and small commercial companies served by retail independent agents and brokers, and specialty excess and surplus lines (E S) distributed through wholesale brokers. 

On the consumer insurance side, we have a broad range of products for individual consumers and their families that include automobile, homeowners, fine art, planes and boats, personal liability, cell phones, accident, travel, supplemental health and life insurance.  The consumer insurance product area where the Chubb Corp acquisition makes the greatest impact is property and casualty personal lines, primarily in the U.S. where the new Chubb remains the premier provider of personal lines to high net worth individuals and families.  The balance of our global personal lines business is written outside the U.S. and ranges from general-market auto in Malaysia, Thailand and in Mexico, where we have over one million customers, to specialty mobile phone replacement coverage in Europe.   

A H business comprises personal accident and supplemental health coverage typically sold as either a group benefit via employer plans or as special insurance protection offerings from a sponsoring organization for its members and customers.  We sell our A H products through a variety of channels including independent agents, brokers, tied agents, direct marketing and bank branches.   

Chubb Life is focused on Asia and primarily uses exclusive agency and bancassurance distribution.   

Chubb Tempest Re, our global reinsurance business, provides a broad range of traditional reinsurance coverage to a diverse array of primary P C companies.  This business is offered worldwide through major business units in Bermuda, North America, Europe, and Asia, with expertise in property catastrophe reinsurance and other diversified lines. This business has been shrinking for several years in the face of declining reinsurance rates and increasing competition.   
       
  Customers 
  The new Chubb today has an extremely broad mix of commercial and personal customers.  On the commercial side, our customers range from large domestic companies and multinational corporations to middle market commercial businesses of all sizes to small commercial enterprises and even the microbusiness market.  On the personal insurance side, our customers range from high net worth families in the U.S., where we insure their homes, cars and precious valuables, to lower-middle income consumers in emerging markets purchasing accident insurance from their credit card, cell phone or utility provider.  The addition of Chubb Corp s leading franchises serving middle market commercial customers in the U.S., Europe and several major markets in Asia and Latin America, as well as their premier business serving U.S. high net worth individuals and families, substantially deepen and broaden the company s portfolio of customer segments.   
    
  Segment Reporting 
  Effective the first quarter of 2016 and subsequent to our acquisition of Chubb Corp, we operate through the following business segments: North America Commercial P C Insurance, North America Personal P C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance. 2015 results were revised to conform to the new segment presentation and only include legacy ACE results (i.e., does not include legacy Chubb results except in "As If" presentations as defined below).

Table of Contents  

The segments are as follows: 

The North America Commercial P C Insurance segment includes the business written by Chubb divisions that provide property and casualty (P C) insurance and services to large, middle market and small commercial businesses in the U.S., Bermuda, and Canada. These divisions write a variety of coverages, including traditional commercial property, marine, general casualty, workers  compensation, package policies, and risk management; specialty categories such as professional lines, marine and construction risk, environmental and cyber risk, excess casualty, as well as group accident and health (A H) insurance.  The divisions included in this segment are North America Major Accounts, Commercial Insurance, Westchester, and North America Small Commercial. 
                
    The North America Personal P C Insurance segment includes the business written by Chubb s North America Personal Risk Services division, which provides affluent and high net worth individuals and families with homeowners, automobile, valuables, umbrella, and recreational marine insurance and services. 
                
    The North America Agricultural Insurance segment continues to include the business written by Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc. which provides comprehensive multiple peril crop and crop-hail insurance, and Chubb Agribusiness, which offers farm and ranch property as well as specialty P C coverages, including commercial agriculture products. 
                
    The Overseas General Insurance segment includes the business written by two Chubb divisions that provide P C insurance and services in the 51 countries outside of North America where the company operates.  Chubb International provides commercial P C traditional and specialty lines serving large corporations, middle market, and small customers. In addition, Chubb International provides A H and traditional and specialty personal lines through retail brokers, agents and other channels locally around the world. Chubb Global Markets provides commercial P C excess and surplus lines and A H through wholesale brokers in the London market and through Lloyd s.  These divisions write a variety of coverages, including traditional commercial property and casualty, specialty categories such as financial lines, marine, energy, aviation, political risk and construction risk, as well as group A H and traditional and specialty personal lines.   
                
    The Global Reinsurance segment primarily includes the reinsurance business written by Chubb Tempest Re as well as the legacy Chubb U.K. Assumed Reinsurance business, which is active, and the legacy Chubb run-off Reinsurance business. 
                
    The Life Insurance segment includes the business written by Chubb Life, Chubb Tempest Life Re, and Combined Insurance s North America operations. The legacy Chubb life insurance business in Latin America is also included in this segment.  
       
  Corporate includes all run-off asbestos and environmental (A E) exposures, the results of its run-off Brandywine business, the results of its Westchester Specialty operations for 1996 and prior years, and certain other run-off exposures. Chubb s exposure to A E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when it purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA s P C business in 1999, and legacy Chubb business in 2016. These A E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites.  Corporate also includes the results of Chubb s non-insurance companies, including Chubb Limited, Chubb Group Management and Holdings Ltd., and Chubb INA Holdings Inc. (Chubb INA).  Corporate results consist primarily of investment income, including the amortization of the fair value adjustment of acquired invested assets related to the Chubb Corp acquisition, the non-operating income of our partially-owned entities, interest expense, corporate staff expenses, Chubb integration expenses and other merger-related expenses (both included in Chubb integration expenses in the consolidated statements of operations) and other expenses not attributable to specific reportable segments. Chubb integration expenses are one-time costs that are directly attributable to the achievement of the annualized savings, including employee severance, third-party consulting fees, and systems integration expenses. Other merger-related expenses are one-time costs directly attributable to the merger, including rebranding, employee retention costs and other professional and legal fees related to the Chubb Corp acquisition.  The Chief Executive Officer does not manage segment results or allocate resources to segments when considering these costs and they are therefore excluded from our definition of segment income.  
    
  Segment income includes underwriting income, investment income, other operating income and expense items such as each segment's share of the operating income (loss) related to partially-owned entities and miscellaneous income and expense items for which the segments are held accountable. Beginning with the third quarter of 2016, segment income also included amortization of purchased intangibles related to business combination intangible assets acquired by the segment and other purchase accounting related intangible assets, including agency relationships, renewal rights, and client lists. These costs were previously included in Corporate. The amortization of intangible assets purchased as part of the Chubb Corp acquisition is considered a Corporate cost as these are incurred by the overall company. We determined that this definition of segment income

     Table of Contents  

is appropriate and aligns with how the business is managed. As we progress through the integration and refine our processes, we may continue to further refine our segments and segment income measures.  
    
  Combined legacy ACE and legacy Chubb results ("As If") 
    
  We present financial measures on an "As If" basis on both the current and prior year periods throughout the Management's Discussion and Analysis section exclusive of the impact of the unearned premium reserves intangible amortization and the elimination of the historical policy acquisition costs as a result of purchase accounting related to the Chubb Corp acquisition in order to present the underlying profitability of our insurance business for the entire relevant periods.  We believe these measures provide visibility into our results, allow for comparability to our historical results and are consistent with how management evaluates results.  We define our results presented on an "As If" basis as follows: 
    
  2016 "As If" results: The combined company results do not include the impact of the unearned premium reserves intangible amortization and the elimination of the historical policy acquisition costs as a result of purchase accounting related to the Chubb Corp acquisition. The combined company results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are inclusive of the first 14 days of January 2016 (the Chubb Corp acquisition closed January 14, 2016). 
    
  2015 "As If" results: Legacy ACE plus legacy Chubb Corp historical results after accounting policy alignment adjustments, including reclassifying certain legacy Chubb Corp corporate expenses to administrative expenses and redefining legacy Chubb Corp segment underwriting income by allocating the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs to each segment.  2015 "As If" results exclude purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb Corp acquisition.  
    
  A reconciliation of "As If" results as defined above is provided under the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section starting on page   81  . 

Total company and P C net premiums written of $7.6 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, up 60.8 percent and 67.0 percent, respectively, reflecting the acquisition of Chubb Corp. P C net premiums written decreased 4.5 percent, or 3.4 percent in constant dollars, when compared with the prior year period as if legacy ACE and legacy Chubb were one company in 2015 ("As If" basis).  
                
    Since the acquisition of Chubb Corp, we have entered into new reinsurance agreements with third-party reinsurers for certain legacy Chubb Corp business. The purchase of additional merger-related reinsurance adversely impacted total company net premiums written growth by $260 million, of which $200 million relates to personal lines and $60 million relates primarily to commercial P C lines. The $200 million personal lines reinsurance premium included $128 million from a one-time unearned premium reserve (UPR) transfer which impacted net premiums written in the current quarter only. Excluding the one-time UPR transfer, the annual impact to personal lines of this new treaty is expected to be approximately $280 million. 
                
    Total company net premiums earned increased 62.9 percent, or 64.6 percent in constant dollars, reflecting the acquisition of Chubb Corp. On an "As If" basis, total company net premiums earned decreased 2.7 percent, or 1.6 percent in constant dollars. 
                
    P C combined ratio was 86.0 percent compared with 85.9 percent in the prior year period. On an  As If  basis, P C combined ratio was 85.5 percent compared with 85.0 percent in the prior year period. On an "As If" basis, current accident year P C combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 88.4 percent compared with 88.9 percent in the prior year period.  
                
    The P C expense ratio was 29.0 percent, compared with 27.1 percent in the prior year period. On an "As If" basis, the P C expense ratio was 28.5 percent, compared with 29.1 percent in the prior year period. 
                
    Total pre-tax and after-tax catastrophe losses were $144 million (2.0 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $107 million, respectively, compared with $72 million (1.7 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $59 million, respectively, in the prior year period. On an "As If" basis, total pre-tax and after-tax catastrophe losses for the prior year period were $101 million (1.4 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $78 million, respectively. 
                
    Total pre-tax and after-tax favorable prior period development was $349 million (4.9 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $252 million, respectively, compared with $210 million pre-tax (5.0 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $180 million after-tax in the prior year period. Favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter is net of a pre-tax environmental liability run-off charge in the company s Brandywine operation of $52 million. On an "As If" basis, total  

55 

Table of Contents  

pre-tax and after-tax favorable prior period development for the prior year period was $389 million (5.3 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $297 million, respectively. 
             
    Net investment income was $739 million which is net of $91 million related to the amortization of the fair value adjustment on acquired invested assets of Chubb Corp. Excluding this amortization, net investment income was $830 million, compared with $549 million last year.   
       
  Outlook 
    
  Chubb produced net income of $1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016, reflecting our strong underwriting results. Previously contemplated merger-related underwriting actions taken on select portfolios of business, particularly a greater use of reinsurance, reduced net premium growth in the quarter while improving our risk-reward profile.  We expect that the impact from these actions will continue through 2016 and 2017, but at a reduced level. In addition, a competitive insurance market and relatively weak global economic conditions impacted premium revenue in the quarter as we maintained our underwriting discipline.  We believe growth will improve as the impact from the underwriting actions dissipates and market conditions improve. In particular, we are building on the potential of our middle market businesses, both domestic and international, with both traditional core package and specialty products.  We also believe that we have greater growth potential in our A H and personal lines businesses.  For the large account and upper middle markets, we are combining product and expertise to bring total solutions to clients.   
  Our integration plans and activities are in good shape.  We are ahead of schedule in realized and annualized savings, as indicated in the table below, and we have now increased the total annualized run-rate savings we expect to achieve by the end of 2018 to $800 million, up from our first quarter 2016 estimate of $750 million.   
  The following table presents expected annualized and realized integration-related savings and integration and merger-related expenses by year:   

   1)    Realized savings are the portion that is recorded in the financial statements in the current period. Annualized savings are the annualized run rate of the realized savings that will impact future years. 
   (2)    Integration expenses related to savings are one-time costs that are directly attributable to the achievement of the annualized savings, including employee severance, third-party consulting fees, and systems integration expenses. Other merger-related expenses are one-time costs directly attributable to the merger, including rebranding, employee retention costs and other professional and legal fees related to the acquisition. 
    
  The anticipated integration-related savings and integration and merger-related expenses may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee. Some of the assumptions that we have made, such as the achievement of operating synergies, may not be realized.  Refer to the Risk Factors under Part II, Item 1A on page   107   for additional information.

    On a constant-dollar basis for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net premiums written increased   $2,914   million and   $7,982   million, respectively, and net premiums earned increased   $3,015   million and   $8,992   million, respectively.  Amounts are calculated by translating prior period results using the same local currency rates as the comparable current period.  
       
  Net premiums written reflect the premiums we retain after purchasing reinsurance protection. Consolidated net premiums written   increased     $2,864   million and   $7,638   million for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition, which added about $2.8 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, of growth to premiums.  This increase in premiums was partially offset by the adverse impact of foreign exchange of $50 million and $344 million, respectively. On a constant-dollar basis, as if legacy ACE and legacy Chubb were one company in 2015 and since the beginning of 2016 ("As If" basis), net premiums written   decreased     $226   million and   $625   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 

Net premiums written in our North America Commercial P C Insurance segment   increased     $1,677   million and   $4,499   million for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. On an "As If" basis, net premiums written declined $76 million and $191 million for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, principally due to merger-related underwriting actions ($75 million and $158 million, respectively), including the purchase of additional reinsurance. Excluding these actions, net premiums written were flat for the quarter and down slightly for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Net premiums written in our North America Personal P C Insurance segment   increased     $733   million and   $2,155   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. On an "As If" basis, net premiums written decreased   $199   million and   $456   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily driven by the purchase of additional reinsurance in the third quarter of 2016 ($200 million) primarily for our homeowners business written in the northeast United States. In addition, we experienced a decline in our Fireman s Fund high net worth personal lines business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $32 million and $296 million, respectively.  The decline for the three month period was primarily due to the conversion to Chubb legal entities. The decline for the nine month period was driven by $252 million of a non-recurring unearned premium reserves (UPR) transfer in the prior year as well as the conversion to Chubb legal entities in the

current year.  Excluding these items, net premiums written were up 3.1 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Net premiums written in our Overseas General Insurance segment   increased     $356   million and   $965   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , net premiums written   decreased     $34   million, on an "As If" constant-dollar basis, primarily driven by merger-related underwriting actions ($47 million), including the purchase of additional reinsurance. Excluding these actions, net premiums written were relatively flat as growth in personal lines in Asia and Europe was offset by declines in commercial property and casualty lines (P C) in Latin America, reflecting economic conditions. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net premiums written   increased     $14   million on a constant dollar "As If" basis, primarily driven by growth in personal and A H lines. 

Net premiums written in our North America Agricultural Insurance segment   increased     $112   million and   $84   million for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to higher premium retention as a result of the premium-sharing formulas with the U.S. government and lower cessions under existing third-party proportional reinsurance programs. Growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was partially offset by lower premium retention as a result of the government's crop insurance profit and loss calculation formulas related to the 2015 crop year in the first quarter.   

Net premiums written in our Life Insurance segment increased $  40   million and $  92   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and increased $  17   million and $  21   million, respectively, on an "As If" basis.  Growth in our international life operations and in our Combined Insurance Supplemental A H program business was partially offset by the adverse effect of foreign exchange. Our life reinsurance business continues to decline as there is no new life reinsurance business currently being written.  

Net premiums written in our Global Reinsurance segment decreased $  54   million and $  157   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and declined $  54   million and $  164   million, respectively, on an "As If" basis, as we maintained underwriting discipline in an environment of declining rates and increasing competition.  In addition, the decline in premiums reflects increased cessions of $6 million and $17 million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to the purchase of additional property catastrophe retrocession contracts in 2016.

    For purposes of this schedule only, A H results from our Combined North America and International businesses, normally included in the Life Insurance and Overseas General Insurance segments, respectively, as well as the A H results of our North America Commercial P C segment, are included in the Global A H line item above. 
       
  Total commercial P C increased $1,845 million (  89.2   percent) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the Chubb Corp acquisition.  On a constant-dollar  As If  basis, total commercial P C premiums declined $104 million (2.6 percent), primarily driven by merger-related underwriting actions ($104 million), including the purchase of additional reinsurance for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Total personal lines increased $830 million (140.4 percent) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the Chubb Corp acquisition.  On a constant-dollar  As If  basis, total personal lines growth declined $189 million (11.7 percent), primarily driven by the purchase of additional reinsurance and other merger-related underwriting actions in the third quarter of 2016 ($204 million), primarily for our homeowners business written in the northeast United States.  
    
  Global A H lines increased $101 million (11.4 percent) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the Chubb Corp acquisition. On a constant-dollar "As If" basis, Global A H lines decreased $4 million (0.4 percent) primarily reflecting merger-related underwriting actions ($14 million).

Table of Contents  

Reinsurance lines decreased $54 million (29.4 percent) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, or $51 million (28.5 percent) on a constant dollar "As If" basis, as we maintained underwriting discipline in an environment of declining rates, and due to increased cessions reflecting the purchase of additional property catastrophe retrocession contracts in 2016 ($6 million). 
    
  Net premiums earned for short-duration contracts, typically P C contracts, generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire.  Net premiums earned for long-duration contracts, typically traditional life contracts, generally are recognized as earned when due from policyholders. Net premiums earned increased   $2,969   million and   $8,684   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition which added about $3.0 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively, of growth to premiums partially offset by the adverse impact of foreign currency of $46 million and $308 million, respectively.  On a constant-dollar basis, net premiums earned increased   $3,015   million and   $8,992   million, for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  On an "As If" constant-dollar basis, net premiums earned   decreased     $123   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily in our North America Personal P C Insurance, North America Commercial P C Insurance, and Global Reinsurance segments due to the same factors driving the decrease in net premiums written as described above. Net premiums earned in our North America Agricultural Insurance segment increased due to the same factors driving the increase in net premiums written, as described above. 
    
  On an "As If" constant-dollar basis, net premiums earned   increased     $102   million, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , reflecting the earning in of prior year premium growth.  
    
  In evaluating our segments excluding Life, we use the P C combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio (including the impact of realized gains and losses on crop derivatives for the North America Agricultural Insurance segment), the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. We calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. We do not calculate these ratios for the Life segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that segment. The P C combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. A P C combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting loss. 
    
  The following table presents the components of the P C combined ratio. A reconciliation of the P C combined ratio to the GAAP combined ratio is provided under the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section starting on page   81  .  

The following table presents the pre-tax catastrophe losses, excluding reinstatement premiums, and pre-tax favorable prior period development:   

Catastrophe losses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were primarily related to severe weather-related events in the U.S. and Europe, a wildfire in Canada, and an earthquake in Ecuador. Catastrophe losses in the prior year periods were primarily related to severe weather-related events in the U.S. and Asia, a chemical plant explosion in Tianjin, China, a hailstorm in Australia, and flooding and an earthquake in Chile.  

60 

     Table of Contents  

Prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss events that occurred in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years.  
    
  The following table presents the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and prior period reserve development on our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio. The loss ratio numerator includes losses and loss expenses adjusted to exclude catastrophe losses and PPD. The loss ratio denominator includes Net premiums earned adjusted to exclude the amount of reinstatement premiums (expensed) collected. In periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from PPD and net earned premiums when calculating this ratio. We believe that excluding the impact of catastrophe losses and PPD provides a better evaluation of our underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our property   casualty business that may be obscured by these items. 

The adjusted loss and loss expense ratio   decreased     2.2   percentage points and   1.4   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the net favorable impact of the Chubb Corp acquisition which experienced a relatively lower loss ratio in our North America P C businesses but experienced a higher loss ratio in our international business. The current periods also included claims handling expense savings realized in connection with the integration of Chubb Corp of   $17 million   and   $35 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  On an "As-If" basis, the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio   increased     0.2   percentage points for both the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a shift in the mix of business to products which experienced a higher loss ratio, partially offset by integration related claims handling expense savings as noted above. The increase for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was also impacted by lower short-tail losses in the prior year. 
    
  Policy acquisition costs consist of commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs directly related to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract.  Our policy acquisition cost ratio   increased     3.9   percentage points and   4.2   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the normal impact of initial year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb Corp acquisition and the prior year acquisition of Fireman's Fund. The Chubb Corp purchase accounting includes a fair value adjustment related to the unearned premiums at the date of the purchase. This adjustment is then amortized into policy acquisition costs over the remaining coverage period. Partially offsetting this is a favorable impact related to the recognition of the acquired unearned premiums without having to recognize the associated policy acquisition costs. The net impact of these purchase accounting adjustments was an increase to policy acquisition costs of $39 million (0.5 percentage points) and $169 million (0.8 percentage points) for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. The prior year Fireman's Fund purchase accounting included the favorable impact related to the recognition of the acquired unearned premiums without having to recognize the associated policy acquisition costs of $33 million (0.8 percentage points) and $81 million (0.7 percentage points) reduction to the prior year, respectively. In addition, during 2016, we determined that certain underwriting costs that are directly attributable to the successful acquisition of business previously classified as administrative expenses were more appropriately classified as policy acquisition costs.  This resulted in a $73 million (1.0 percentage points) and $217 million (1.1 percentage points) increase to policy acquisition costs, with an offsetting decrease to administrative expenses for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  On an "As If" basis, the policy acquisition cost ratio increased   0.1   percentage points and   0.3   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the impact of the Fireman s Fund acquisition in 2015 which favorably impacted both of the prior year ratios by 0.4 percentage points. 
    
  Our administrative expense ratio   decreased     2.0   percentage points and   2.1   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the $73 million (1.0 percentage points) and $217 million (1.1

percentage points) reclassification of underwriting costs that are directly attributable to the successful acquisition of business, as discussed above, and cost savings realized as a result of the Chubb Corp acquisition of $  70 million   (1.0 percentage point) and $  144 million   (0.7 percentage points), respectively.  
    
  On an "As If" basis, our administrative expense ratio   decreased     0.7   percentage points and   0.5   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to cost savings realized as a result of the Chubb Corp acquisition as discussed above, partially offset by increased spending to support growth initiatives.  
    
  Policy benefits include gains and losses for changes in liabilities associated with our separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP.  Certain of our long duration contracts are supported by assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP.  These assets are classified as trading securities and reported in Other investments and the offsetting liabilities are reported in Future policy benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP are reported in Other income (expense) and the offsetting movements in the liabilities are included in the Policy benefits in the consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Policy benefits were $155 million, which included $22 million of separate account liabilities losses, compared to $89 million in the prior year, which included gains of $49 million related to separate account liabilities.  The offsetting movements of these liabilities are recorded in Other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations.  Excluding the separate account gains and losses, Policy benefits were $133 million and $138 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Policy benefits were $427 million, which included $22 million of separate account liabilities losses, compared to $384 million in the prior year, which included a gain of $32 million related to separate account liabilities.  Excluding the separate account gains and losses, Policy benefits were $405 million and $416 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our effective income tax rate, which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax, is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates. A change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate.  
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our effective income tax rate was 17.0 percent and 20.0 percent, respectively.  The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a higher percentage of realized gains being generated in lower taxing jurisdictions in the current year compared to realized losses in lower taxing jurisdictions in the prior year.  
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our effective income tax rate was 18.1 percent and 15.5 percent, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a higher percentage of realized losses being generated in lower taxing jurisdictions and a higher percentage of operating profits being generated in higher taxing jurisdictions, largely driven by earnings generated as a result of the Chubb Corp acquisition.  
    
  The lower tax rates attributed to our foreign operations primarily reflect the lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the U.S. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 55 percent and 51 percent of our total pre-tax income was tax effected based on these lower rates compared with 57 percent and 63 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The significant lower taxing jurisdictions outside of the U.S. include the U.K., Switzerland, and Bermuda with effective federal income tax rates in those countries of 20.0 percent, 7.83 percent, and 0.0 percent, respectively. In addition, as part of the Chubb Corp acquisition, we have an intercompany loan that decreased our income tax expense by $22 million and $64 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Prior Period Development 
  The following tables summarize (favorable) and adverse prior period development (PPD) by segment. Long-tail lines include lines such as workers' compensation, general liability, and professional liability; while short-tail lines include lines such as most property lines, energy, personal accident, aviation, marine (including associated liability-related exposures), and agriculture. Significant prior period movements by segment, principally driven by reserve reviews completed during each respective period, are discussed in more detail below. The remaining net development for long-tail and short-tail business for each segment comprises numerous favorable and adverse movements across a number of lines and accident years, none of which is significant individually or in the aggregate.

  2016 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , net favorable PPD was $187 million, which was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements, driven by the following principal changes: 

Net favorable development of $145 million in long-tail business, primarily from favorable development of $127 million in our commercial excess and umbrella portfolios, impacting the 2010 and prior accident years, driven by continued lower than expected reported loss activity and an increase in weighting towards experience-based methods; and 

Net favorable development of $42 million in short-tail business, primarily from net favorable development of $43 million in our property and inland marine portfolios, primarily impacting the 2014 and 2015 accident years, resulting from lower than expected loss emergence.

Favorable development of $272 million in our commercial excess and umbrella portfolios, primarily in accident years 2010 and prior, driven by lower than expected reported loss activity and an increase in weighting towards experience-based methods; in general, the severity of claims has been less than expected; 

Net favorable development of $134 million in our workers  compensation lines with favorable development of $40 million in the 2015 accident year related to our annual assessment of multi-claimant events including industrial accidents.  Favorable development of $91 million driven by accident years 2012 and prior was principally due to lower than expected loss experience and revision to the basis for selecting development patterns used in our loss projection methods; 

Favorable development of $65 million in our professional Errors   Omission (E O) portfolios, primarily impacting the 2012 and prior accident years and arising from both lower than expected reported loss activity and re-assessments of remaining claim-specific liabilities for the older accident years; 

Net favorable development of $23 million in our primary general and package liability lines from favorable development due to lower than expected reported and paid activity, principally in accident years 2007 through 2014; and 

Net adverse development of $40 million, including $16 million and $10 million in our high deductible general liability excess and automobile lines, respectively. 

Net favorable development of $79 million in short-tail business, primarily from net favorable development of $56 million in our property and inland marine portfolios, primarily impacting the 2014 and 2015 accident years, resulting from lower than expected loss emergence.

Net favorable development of $22 million in our workers  compensation lines with favorable development of $52 million in the 2014 accident year related to our annual assessment of multi-claimant events including industrial accidents. Consistent with prior years, we reviewed these potential exposures after the close of the accident year to allow for late reporting or identification of significant losses. Adverse development of $30 million impacting the 2009 and prior accident years was due to a combination of claim-specific deteriorations and higher than expected loss emergence. There was additional adverse development in the 2014 accident year due to revised account-level estimates, which proved to be higher than our original aggregate expectations; and 

Net favorable development of $47 million, due to several underlying favorable and adverse movements, none of which were significant individually or in the aggregate.

  Corporate 
  2016 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, adverse development was $62 million, driven principally by development of $52 million in environmental liabilities and $10 million for unallocated loss adjustment expenses, impacting the 1995 and prior accident years. The development in environmental liabilities was due to case specific settlements and both higher than expected remediation expense and defense costs. These higher costs impacted both large modeled accounts as well as smaller accounts. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net adverse PPD was $84 million, driven principally by development of environmental liabilities as described above and $27 million of unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid and incurred on our run-off lines.  
    
  2015 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, adverse development was   $84 million  , driven principally by development in Brandywine, including $76 million for environmental liabilities and $7 million for unallocated loss adjustment expenses, impacting the 1995 and prior accident years. Development in environmental liabilities was due to case specific settlements and both higher than expected remediation expense and defense costs. These higher costs impacted both large modeled accounts as well as small accounts.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net adverse development was   $140 million  , driven principally by development of $139 million in our Brandywine environmental and run-off portfolios, including $76 million for environmental liabilities and $41 million primarily in general and products liability lines, and $22 million of unallocated loss adjustment expenses, impacting the 1995 and prior accident years.  Development in environmental liabilities was due to the same factors experienced for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as described above.  Run-off lines development was primarily due to higher than expected loss activity. 

Effective the first quarter of 2016, reflecting our significantly larger and expanded operations, subsequent to the Chubb Corp acquisition, we implemented organizational changes that resulted in new business segments. We operate through six business segments: North America Commercial P C Insurance, North America Personal P C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance. We have also redefined Corporate to include all run-off asbestos and environmental (A E) exposures, the results of run-off Brandywine business, the results of Westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years and certain other run-off exposures. Prior period amounts contained in this report have been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation.  

North America Commercial P C Insurance 
    
  The North America Commercial P C Insurance segment comprises operations that provide property and casualty (P C) insurance and services to large, middle market, and small commercial businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Bermuda. This segment includes our North American Major Accounts and Specialty Insurance (principally large corporate accounts and wholesale business), and the North American Commercial Insurance divisions (principally middle market and small commercial accounts).    

Net premiums written   increased     $1,677   million and   $4,499   million for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition which added about $1.6 billion and $4.4 billion in premiums to this segment, respectively.  
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   on an "As If" basis, net premiums written declined $76 million, principally due to merger-related underwriting actions ($75 million), including the purchase of additional reinsurance. Excluding these actions, net premiums written were flat as the decline in our Commercial Insurance business was offset by growth in our Major Accounts and Wholesale businesses. The decline in Commercial Insurance was principally from lower new business written, reflecting competitive market conditions in the commercial multiple peril and property lines. The slight increase in Major

     Table of Contents  

Accounts was principally in our primary risk management business where we have been able to differentiate our offerings and global service platform. The increase in our Wholesale business was primarily in our small commercial business. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, on an "As If" basis, net premiums written declined $191 million, principally reflecting merger-related underwriting actions ($158 million), including the purchase of additional reinsurance which decreased premiums and lower new business written, driven by competitive market conditions and rate declines. Partially offsetting the decline was growth in our global risk management and workers' compensation lines reflecting new business and strong renewal retention. 
  Net premiums earned   increased     $1,676   million and   $4,921   million for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition which added $1.7 billion and $4.9 billion of growth in earned premiums, respectively. On an "As If" basis, net premiums earned decreased $  70   million and   $6   million, respectively, primarily due to the     same factors driving the decrease in net premiums written as described above, partially offset by the earning in of prior year premium growth. 
  The following table presents the pre-tax catastrophe losses and pre-tax favorable prior period development:   

Catastrophe losses through September 30, 2016 were primarily from severe weather-related events in the U.S. and a wildfire in Canada. Catastrophe losses through September 30, 2015, were primarily from severe weather-related events in the U.S. and the civil unrest in Baltimore, Maryland. 
  The following table presents the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and prior period reserve development on our loss and loss expense ratio: 

The adjusted loss and loss expense ratio   decreased     4.5   percentage points and   4.8   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the addition of the Chubb Corp business, which carried a lower loss ratio. On an "As If" basis, the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio increased 0.9 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to lower non-catastrophe losses in the prior year periods, partially offset by integration related claims handling expense savings realized in connection with the integration of Chubb Corp of $10 million (0.3 percentage points) and $19 million (0.2 percentage points), respectively. 
    
  The policy acquisition cost ratio   increased     6.8   percentage points and   7.4   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the addition of the Chubb Corp business which carried a higher acquisition cost ratio and due to the normal impact of initial year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb Corp acquisition. In addition, during 2016, we determined that certain underwriting costs that are directly attributable to the successful acquisition of business previously classified as administrative expenses were more appropriately classified as policy acquisition costs.  Excluding these items, the policy acquisition cost ratio was relatively flat for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
    
  The normal impact of initial year purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb Corp acquisition includes a fair value adjustment related to the unearned premiums at the date of the purchase. This adjustment is then amortized into policy

acquisition costs. Partially offsetting this is a favorable impact related to the recognition of the acquired unearned premiums without having to recognize the associated policy acquisition costs. The net impact of these purchase accounting adjustments was an increase to policy acquisition costs of $27 million (0.9 percentage points) and $119 million (1.3 percentage points) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. In addition, reclassification described above resulted in a   $32   million (1.0 percentage point) and   $95   million (1.0 percentage point) increase to policy acquisition costs for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, with an offsetting decrease to administrative expenses. 
    
  On an "As If" basis, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments, the policy acquisition cost ratio decreased by 0.3 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  The administrative expense ratio   decreased   by   2.1     percentage points and   1.7   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the   $32   million and   $95   million reclassification, respectively, noted above which decreased the administrative expense ratio by 1.0 percentage point for each period, and the inclusion of the Chubb Corp businesses which carried a lower administrative expense ratio. 
  On an "As If" basis, the administrative expense ratio decreased 0.3 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as cost savings realized of $27 million (0.9 percentage points) and $59 million (0.6 percentage points), respectively, were partially offset by increased spending to support growth.  

North America Personal P C Insurance 
    
  The North America Personal P C Insurance segment is the business written by the North America Personal Risk Services, which comprises Chubb high net worth personal lines business and ACE Private Risk Services, which includes operations in the U.S. and Canada.    

Net premiums written   increased     $733   million and   $2,155   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition which added about $800 million and $2.5 billion in premiums to this segment, respectively. 
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, on an "As If" basis, net premiums written decreased $199 million and $456 million, respectively, primarily driven by the purchase of additional reinsurance in the third quarter 2016 ($200 million), primarily for our homeowners business written in the northeast United States. In addition, we experienced a decline in our Fireman s Fund high net worth personal lines business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $32

     Table of Contents  

million and $296 million, respectively.  The decline for the three month period was primarily due to the conversion to Chubb legal entities. The decline for the nine month period was driven by $252 million of a non-recurring unearned premium reserves (UPR) transfer in the prior year as well as the conversion to Chubb legal entities in the current year.  Excluding these items, net premiums written were up 3.1 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to growth in our Chubb high net worth business, primarily within our homeowner lines, driven by strong renewal premium retention, rate and exposure increases as well as modest growth in new business.  
  Net premiums earned   increased     $809   million and   $2,558   million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition.  On an "As If" basis, net premiums earned decreased   $66   million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the same factors driving the decrease in net premiums written as described above.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, on an "As If" basis, net premiums earned increased   $41   million, reflecting the earning in of prior year premium growth. 
  The following table presents the pre-tax catastrophe losses and pre-tax favorable prior period development:   

Catastrophe losses through September 30, 2016 were primarily from severe weather-related events in the U.S. Catastrophe losses through September 30, 2015 were primarily from severe weather-related events in the U.S., including the California wildfires. 
  The following table presents the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and prior period reserve development on our loss and loss expense ratio: 

The adjusted loss and loss expense ratio   decreased     3.3   percentage points and   2.4   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the addition of the Chubb Corp business, which experienced a lower loss ratio. On an "As If" basis, the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio decreased   1.4   percentage points and   1.6   percentage points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, reflecting lower non-catastrophe weather related losses and integration related claims handling expense savings of $4 million (0.4 percentage points), and $10 million (0.3 percentage points), respectively. 
    
  The policy acquisition cost ratio   increased     16.3   percentage points and   16.7   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the impact of the Fireman's Fund purchase accounting in the prior year of $33 million (12.0 percentage points) and $81 million (11.8 percentage points), respectively, which included the favorable impact related to the recognition of the acquired unearned premiums without having to recognize the associated policy acquisition costs. In addition, the current year ratio was unfavorably impacted by the inclusion of the Chubb Corp business, which carried a higher acquisition cost ratio, and the normal impact of initial year purchase accounting related to the Chubb Corp acquisition. The Chubb Corp purchase accounting includes a fair value adjustment related to the unearned premiums at the date of purchase. This adjustment is then amortized into policy acquisition costs over the remaining coverage period.  Partially offsetting this is a favorable impact related to the recognition of the acquired unearned premiums without having to recognize the associated policy acquisition costs. The net impact of the Chubb Corp purchase accounting adjustments was an increase to acquisition expenses of $18 million (1.6 percentage points) and $78 million (2.4 percentage points), for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.

On an "As If" basis, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb Corp acquisition, the policy acquisition cost ratio increased   1.2   percentage points and   1.3   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to our Fireman's Fund acquisition in the prior year period which favorably impacted the prior year policy acquisition cost ratio by $33 million (2.8 percentage points) and $81 million (2.4 percentage points), respectively. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of the ceded commission benefits related to the merger-related purchase of additional reinsurance in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  The administrative expense ratio   decreased     4.7   percentage points and   4.5   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition which carried a lower administrative expense ratio. 
    
  On an "As If" basis, the administrative expense ratio decreased   0.2   percentage points for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily reflecting cost savings realized as a result of the Chubb Corp acquisition of $10 million (0.9 percentage points). For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, on an "As If" basis, the administrative expense ratio remained flat as cost savings realized of $25 million (0.7 percentage points), were offset by increased spending to support growth.  

North America Agricultural Insurance 
    
  The North America Agricultural Insurance segment comprises our North American based businesses that provides a variety of coverages in the U.S. and Canada including crop insurance, primarily Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) and crop-hail through Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc. (Rain and Hail) as well as farm and ranch and specialty P C commercial insurance products and services through our Chubb Agribusiness unit.    

            (1)   
    Gains on crop derivatives were     $3 million and $1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared with losses on crop derivatives of $4 million and $6 million for the prior year periods, respectively. These (gains) losses are included in Net realized gains (losses) in our consolidated statements of operations but are reclassified to Losses and loss expenses for purposes of presenting North America Agricultural Insurance underwriting income.  
     Net premiums written   increased     $112   million and   $84   million for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to higher premium retention as a result of the premium-sharing formulas with the U.S. government and lower cessions under existing third-party proportional reinsurance programs. Growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was partially offset by lower premium retention as a result of the government's crop insurance profit and loss calculation formulas related to the 2015 crop year.  
  Net premiums earned   increased     $80   million and   $45   million for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the same factors driving the increase in net premiums written as described above.

The following table presents the pre-tax catastrophe losses and pre-tax favorable prior period development:   

Catastrophe losses through September 30, 2016 and 2015 were primarily from our farm, ranch and specialty P C business. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, net favorable prior period development was   $11 million   and   $52 million  , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the prior period development amount included $85 million of favorable incurred losses due to lower than expected MPCI losses for the 2015 crop year, partially offset by $48 million of unfavorable decrease in net premiums earned related to the government s crop insurance profit and loss calculation formula.  Also included in prior period development but not impacting the loss and loss expense ratio was a $4 million favorable benefit of ceded profit share commissions earned from third-party reinsurers. For the three and   nine months ended   September 30, 2015, net favorable PPD was $5 million and $38 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the prior period development amount included a decrease in incurred losses of $36 million for lower than expected MPCI losses for the 2014 crop year, partially offset by a $3 million unfavorable decrease in net premiums earned related to the governments crop insurance profit and loss calculation formulas.  
  The following table presents the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and prior period reserve development on our loss and loss expense ratio:   

The adjusted loss and loss expense ratio   decreased     0.9   percentage points and   1.0   percentage point for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   respectively, primarily reflecting the gains on crop derivatives in 2016 compared to losses on crop derivatives in 2015.  
    
  The policy acquisition cost ratio remained relatively flat for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   the policy acquisition cost ratio   increased     1.2   percentage points, due primarily to the $48 million reduction in net premiums earned related to the government's crop insurance profit and loss calculation formula this year, compared to a reduction of $3 million in the prior year.  Excluding the impact of these reductions in net premiums earned, the policy acquisition ratio increased over prior year by 0.9 percentage points, primarily due to higher agent profit sharing commissions in the current year. In addition, during 2016, we determined that certain underwriting costs that are directly attributable to the successful acquisition of business previously classified as administrative expenses were more appropriately classified as policy acquisition costs.  This resulted in a $1 million (0.1 percentage points) and $2 million (0.2 percentage points) increase to policy acquisition costs, with an offsetting decrease to administrative expenses for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The administrative expense ratio remained relatively flat for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the administrative expense ratio   decreased     0.4   percentage points primarily due to higher Administrative and Operating (A O) reimbursements on the MPCI business and the reclassification as noted above.

    For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net premiums written increased $  397   million and   $1,247   million, or   25.8   percent and   26.2   percent, respectively, on a constant-dollar basis. Amounts are calculated by translating prior period results using the same local currency rates as the comparable current period.

    For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , underwriting income increased   $99   million and   $122   million, or   34.2   percent and   19.6   percent, respectively, on a constant-dollar basis. Amounts are calculated by translating prior period results using the same local currency rates as the comparable current period 
     Net premiums written   increased     $356   million and   $965   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the impact of the Chubb Corp acquisition, which added about $400 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of growth in premiums. This increase was partially offset by the adverse impact of foreign exchange which   decreased   premiums by   $41   million and   $282   million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , net premiums written   decreased     $34   million, on a constant dollar "As If" basis, primarily driven by merger-related underwriting actions ($47 million), including the purchase of additional reinsurance. Excluding these actions, net premiums written were relatively flat as growth in personal lines in Asia and Europe was offset by declines in commercial property and casualty lines (P C) in Latin America, reflecting economic conditions.  
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net premiums written   increased     $14   million on a constant dollar "As If" basis primarily driven by growth in personal and A H lines which more than offset the declines in net premiums written experienced during the quarter as described above. Growth in personal lines was negatively impacted by our decision to exit the legacy Chubb Brazilian high net worth automobile business due to competitive market conditions.  
  Net premiums earned   increased     $419   million and   $1,186   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   decreased     $29   million and   increased     $74   million on an "As If" constant dollar basis, respectively, primarily due to the same factors driving the movements in net premiums written as described above.

  The following table presents the pre-tax catastrophe losses and pre-tax favorable prior period development:   

Catastrophe losses through   September 30, 2016   were primarily related to severe weather related events in Europe, an earthquake in Ecuador, and flooding in the U.K. Catastrophe losses through   September 30, 2015   were primarily related to a chemical plant explosion in Tianjin, China, a hailstorm in Australia, flooding and an earthquake in Chile, and severe storms in Asia.

The adjusted loss and loss expense ratio   increased     1.2   percentage points and   1.8   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition which experienced a higher loss ratio. 
    
  On an "As If" basis, the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio   decreased     1.5   percentage points for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a lower level of short-tail large losses in the current year. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio increased   0.5   percentage points compared to the prior year which had less short-tail large losses. 
  The policy acquisition cost ratio   increased     1.7   percentage points and   1.8   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily because we determined that certain underwriting costs that are directly attributable to the successful acquisition of business previously classified as administrative expenses were more appropriately classified as policy acquisition costs.  This resulted in a $36 million (1.8 percentage points) and $108 million (1.8 percentage points) increase to policy acquisition costs, with an offsetting decrease to administrative expenses for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  On an "As If" basis, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb Corp acquisition, the policy acquisition cost ratio   increased     0.8   percentage points and   0.7   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to a shift in the mix of business away from E S lines, which carry a lower acquisition cost ratio, towards more personal lines products which carry a higher acquisition cost ratio.  
  The administrative expense ratio   decreased     2.3   percentage points for both the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , due to the $36 million (1.8 percentage points) and $108 million (1.8 percentage points) reclassification noted above, and cost savings realized as a result of the Chubb Corp acquisition of   $23 million   (1.1 percentage points), and   $40 million   (0.6 percentage points), respectively. This decrease was partially offset by increased spending to support growth initiatives. 
  On an "As If" basis, the administrative expense ratio   decreased     0.6   percentage points and   0.8   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to cost savings realized as a result of the Chubb Corp acquisition as noted above, partially offset by increased spending to support growth initiatives.

Global Reinsurance 
    
  The Global Reinsurance segment represents our reinsurance operations comprising Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda, Chubb Tempest Re USA, Chubb Tempest Re International, and Chubb Tempest Re Canada. Following the Chubb Corp acquisition, Chubb Tempest Re USA includes the run-off business of legacy Chubb Re, and Chubb Tempest Re International includes the active legacy Chubb U.K. assumed reinsurance business. Global Reinsurance markets its reinsurance products worldwide under the Chubb Tempest Re brand name and provides a broad range of traditional reinsurance coverage to a diverse array of primary P C companies. 

Net premiums written decreased $  54   million and $  157   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, as we maintained underwriting discipline in an environment of declining rates and increasing competition.  In addition, the decline in premiums reflects increased cessions of $6 million and $17 million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to the purchase of additional property catastrophe retrocession contracts in 2016. 
    
  For the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , on an "As If" basis, net premiums written declined $  54   million and $  164   million, respectively, due to the same factors as described above. 
    
  Net premiums earned decreased $  47   million and $  106   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and also decreased $  56   million and $  124   million, respectively, on an "As If" basis primarily due to the same factors driving the decrease in net premiums written as described above.  
  The following table presents pre-tax catastrophe losses, excluding reinstatement premiums, and pre-tax favorable prior period development, net of related reinstatement premiums: 

Catastrophe losses through   September 30, 2016   were primarily related to the Fort McMurray wildfire and severe weather-related events in Europe, the U.S. and Canada.  Catastrophe losses through   September 30, 2015   were primarily related to severe weather-related events in the U.S.

The following table presents the impact of catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums and prior period reserve development and related reinstatement premiums on our loss and loss expense ratio: 

The adjusted loss and loss expense ratio decreased   0.1   percentage points and   0.4   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to a change in the mix of business towards products that have a lower loss ratio. On an "As If" basis, the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio decreased 1.1 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the change in mix of business as described above. 
    
  The policy acquisition cost ratio increased   1.7   percentage points and   0.8   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to a change in the mix of business towards regions and products that have higher acquisition cost ratios, partially offset by the impact of the Chubb Corp acquisition which carries a lower acquisition cost ratio.  
    
  On an "As If" basis, the policy acquisition cost ratio increased   2.8   percentage points and   1.7   percentage points for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the change in the mix of business as described above. 
    
  The administrative expense ratio increased   1.7   percentage points and   1.5   percentage points for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to decreases in net premiums earned. 
    
  On an "As If" basis, the administrative expense ratio increased   1.6   percentage points and   0.7   percentage points for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to decreases in net premiums earned outpacing the decline in administrative expenses.

Life Insurance 
    
  The Life Insurance segment comprises Chubb's international life operations (Chubb Life), Chubb Tempest Life Re (Chubb Life Re), and the North American supplemental A H and life business of Combined Insurance. We assess the performance of our life business based on Life Insurance underwriting income, which includes Net investment income and (Gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP. 

(1)   
    (Gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP have been reclassified from Other income (expense) for purposes of presenting Life Insurance underwriting income.  The offsetting movement in the separate account liabilities is included in Policy benefits.  
     Net premiums written increased $  40   million and $  92   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily reflecting the impact of the Chubb Corp acquisition, which added $16 million and $52 million of growth to premiums, respectively. In addition, growth in our international life operations, primarily in Asia, and in our Combined Insurance supplemental A H program business contributed to the increase.  The adverse effect of foreign exchange impacted growth in net premiums written by $5 million and $40 million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. Our life reinsurance business continues to decline as there is no new life reinsurance business currently being written. 
  On an "As If" basis, net premiums written increased $  17   million and $  21   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, due to the same factors as described above. 
  The following table presents deposits collected on universal life and investment contracts: 

(1)    On a constant-dollar basis.  Amounts are calculated by translating prior period results using the same local currency rates as the comparable current period.  
    
  Deposits collected on universal life and investment contracts (life deposits) are not reflected as revenues in our Consolidated statements of operations in accordance with GAAP.  New life deposits are an important component of production, and although they do not significantly affect current period income from operations they are key to our efforts to grow our business. Life deposits collected increased for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to growth in the Asian markets, primarily in Hong Kong and Taiwan, partially offset by a decline in Korea.  Foreign exchange adversely impacted growth by $  23   million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Other (income) expense of $  2   million and $  8   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, were related primarily to our share of net (income) loss of partially-owned entities. Refer to the Other Income and Expense Items section for further information.  
    
  Life Insurance underwriting income increased $  8   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year.  The prior year period included an unfavorable loss reserve development in the Combined Insurance supplemental A H program business.  Life insurance underwriting income decreased $  5   million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily reflecting the decline in our life reinsurance business as there is no new business being written. 

Corporate 
    
  Corporate results primarily include the results of our non-insurance companies, income and expenses not attributable to reportable segments and loss and loss expenses of asbestos and environmental (A E) liabilities and certain other run-off exposures.   
    
  Our exposure to A E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA s P C business in 1999, and legacy Chubb Corp A E claims in 2016. Corporate staff expenses and net investment income of Chubb Limited, including the amortization of the fair valued of acquired invested assets and debt, interest expense, amortization of purchased intangibles related to the Chubb Corp acquisition, Chubb integration expenses and other merger-related expenses and the results of Chubb Group Management and Holdings Ltd, and Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. are reported within Corporate. 

Losses and loss expenses in both years were primarily due to unfavorable prior period development related to Brandywine environmental exposures, as well as unallocated loss adjustment expenses of the A E claim operations.  Refer to the Prior Period Development section for further information.  
    
  Administrative expenses increased $  11   million and $  57   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition.  On an "As If" basis, administrative expenses decreased $  27   million and $  39   million, respectively, primarily due to cost savings realized as a result of the Chubb Corp acquisition. 
    
  Net investment income for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   included amortization of $91 million and $292 million, respectively, related to the fair value adjustment on invested assets related to the Chubb Corp acquisition.  Excluding the fair value adjustment amortization, net investment income increased $2 million and $12 million for the three and

     Table of Contents  

nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Refer to the Net Investment Income section for a discussion on consolidated Net investment income. 
    
  Interest expense increased $  84   million and $  244   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, primarily driven by the $5.3 billion senior notes issued in November 2015, as well as the $3.3 billion par value of debt assumed in connection with the Chubb Corp acquisition. 
    
  Net realized gains for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , were primarily associated with a net decrease in the fair value of GLB liabilities. The decrease was primarily due to higher global equity market levels and higher interest rates, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of discounting future claims for one less quarter.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net realized losses were primarily associated with a net increase in the fair value of GLB liabilities.  The increase was primarily due to lower interest rates and the unfavorable impact of discounting future claims for three less quarters.  In addition, we maintain positions in derivative instruments that decrease in fair value when the S P 500 index increases. During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we experienced realized losses of $  45 million   and $  88 million  , respectively, related to these derivative instruments.  Additionally, there were realized gains (losses) on our investment portfolios during the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   of $  21   million and $  (199)   million, respectively.  For further discussion of the remaining Net realized gains and (losses), refer to the Net realized and unrealized gains and (losses) section. 
    
  Other (income) expense of $  (70)   million and $  (59)   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, were related primarily to our share of net (income) loss of partially-owned entities. Refer to the Other Income and Expense Items section for further information.  
    
  Amortization benefit of purchased intangibles related to the Chubb Corp acquisition was $  20   million and $  60   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, reflecting the favorable impact of the amortization of the fair value adjustment on acquired Unpaid losses and loss expense, offset by the amortization of other intangibles, including agency distribution relationships and internally developed technology, related to the Chubb Corp acquisition.  This amortization is considered a corporate cost as it is incurred by the overall company. 
    
  Chubb integration expenses were $  115   million for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily comprising $37 million of personnel-related expenses, including severance and employee retention and relocation, $25 million of consulting fees, and $21 million of leases and real estate costs.  Chubb integration expenses were $  361   million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily comprising $153 million of personnel-related expenses, $70 million of consulting fees, $34 million of leases and real estate costs, and $38 million of advisor fees.  Chubb integration expenses are one-time in nature and are not related to the on-going business activities of the segments.  The Chief Executive Officer does not manage segment results or allocate resources to segments when considering these costs and they are therefore excluded from our definition of segment income. 

Non-GAAP Reconciliation 
    
  We provide financial measures such as net premiums written and net premiums earned on a constant-dollar basis.  We believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in these measures exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. The impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period. 
    
  P C performance metrics are non-GAAP financial measures and comprise consolidated operating results (including Corporate) and exclude the operating results of the Life Insurance segment. We believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company s P C operations which are the most economically similar.  We exclude the Life Insurance segment because the results of this business do not always correlate with the results of our P C operations.    
    
  "As If" measures presented throughout this section are prepared exclusive of the impact of the unearned premium reserves intangible amortization and the elimination of the historical policy acquisition costs as a result of purchase accounting related to the Chubb Corp acquisition in order to present the underlying profitability of our insurance business for the entire relevant periods.  We believe this measure provides visibility into our results, allows for comparability to our historical results and is

consistent with how management evaluates results.  We have discussed our results on an "As If" basis for both the current and prior year periods, which are defined below: 
    
  2016 "As If" results: The combined company results do not include the impact of the unearned premium reserves intangible amortization and the elimination of the historical policy acquisition costs as a result of purchase accounting related to the Chubb Corp acquisition.  The combined company results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are inclusive of the first 14 days of January 2016 (the Chubb Corp acquisition closed January 14, 2016). 
    
  2015 "As If" results: Legacy ACE plus legacy Chubb Corp historical results after accounting policy alignment adjustments, including reclassifying certain legacy Chubb Corp corporate expenses to administrative expenses and redefining legacy Chubb Corp segment underwriting income by allocating the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs to each segment.  2015 "As If" results exclude purchase accounting adjustments. 
    
  The following tables present a reconciliation of 2016 "As If" results to 2016 results, as well as 2015 "As If" results to 2015 results and pro forma results as calculated in accordance with SEC Article 11:

These derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing will impact underwriting results. We view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations. 

Other Income and Expense Items 

(1)   
    Related to (gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP. 
               (2)   
    Excludes integration costs related to the Chubb Corp acquisition. 
       
  Other (income) expense includes equity in net (income) loss of partially-owned entities, which includes our share of net (income) loss related to partially-owned investment companies (private equity) and partially-owned insurance companies. Also included in Other (income) expense are (Gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP. The offsetting movement in the separate account liabilities is included in Policy benefits in the Consolidated statements of operations. Certain federal excise and capital taxes incurred as a result of capital management initiatives are included in Other (income) expense as these are considered capital transactions and are excluded from underwriting results.

Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Other Amortization 

Amortization of purchased intangibles was $  4   million and $  16   million for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with $  51   million and $  136   million in the prior year periods, respectively.  Amortization of purchased intangibles was lower in 2016 due primarily to the favorable impact of the amortization benefit of the fair value adjustment on acquired Unpaid losses and loss expense offset by the amortization expense of other intangibles, including agency distribution relationships and internally developed technology, related to the Chubb Corp acquisition.  For example, as presented in the table below, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect to recognize amortization expense of   $3 million   which includes $20 million of amortization benefit related to the Chubb Corp acquisition that will offset   $23 million   of amortization expense related to our other intangibles. 
    
  The following table presents, as of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated pre-tax amortization expense (benefit), at current foreign currency exchange rates, for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the next five years, for intangibles related to the Chubb Corp acquisition and intangibles from prior acquisitions:     

Amortization of Unearned premium reserves (UPR) intangible assets and Expected future benefit associated with the elimination of historical deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) asset 
  At the date of the Chubb Corp acquisition, as part of purchase accounting, we recorded an intangible asset of $1,550 million related to the fair value adjustment for the UPR recorded on legacy Chubb Corp books, which is expected to amortize over the remaining coverage period as additional policy acquisition costs.  At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining UPR intangible asset balance of $144 million, at current foreign currency exchange rates, is expected to fully amortize in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  In addition, as part of purchase accounting, we expected to recognize a benefit of $1,376 million associated with unearned premiums being recognized over the remaining coverage period with no expense for the historical acquisition costs.  The recognition of this DAC elimination is expected to amortize in a similar pattern as the UPR intangible asset amortization as noted above. At   September 30, 2016  , the remaining benefit associated with the DAC elimination of $128 million, at current foreign currency exchange rates, is expected to fully amortize in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  Reduction of deferred tax liability associated with intangible assets related to the Chubb Corp acquisition 
  At the date of acquisition, we recorded a deferred tax liability of $  2,679 million  , which assumed an expected   35 percent   tax rate, associated with agency distribution relationships and renewal rights, internally developed technology, and Unearned Premium Reserves (UPR) intangible assets related to the Chubb Corp acquisition. For example, for the fourth quarter of 2016, the expected reduction to deferred tax liability of   $65 million   associated with intangible assets in the table below is calculated by applying the 35 percent expected tax rate against the sum of the estimated amortization of $185 million, comprised of agency distribution relationships and renewal rights of $33 million, internally developed technology of $8 million, and UPR intangible assets of $144 million (from above). At   September 30, 2016  , the deferred tax liability associated with these intangibles was $  2,140 million  .

The following table below presents, as of   September 30, 2016  , the expected reduction to the deferred tax liability at current foreign currency exchange rates, which reduces as agency distribution relationships and renewal rights, internally developed technology, and UPR intangible assets amortize for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the next five years: 

Amortization of the fair value of acquired invested assets 
  In addition to the amortization of purchased intangibles outlined in the table above, at   September 30, 2016  , we expect amortization of the fair value of acquired invested assets of approximately $  100   million for the fourth quarter of 2016, $  360   million in 2017, $  320   million in each 2018 and 2019, and   $250 million   in 2020 at current foreign currency exchange rates. This estimate could vary materially based on current market conditions, bond calls, and overall duration of the acquired investment portfolio. The amortization of the fair value adjustment on acquired invested assets is recorded as a reduction to Net investment income in the Consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Amortization of the fair value adjustment on assumed long-term debt 
  The benefit from the amortization of the fair value adjustment on assumed long-term debt was $  12 million   and $  35 million   for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we expect a benefit from the amortization of the fair value adjustment on assumed long-term debt of $  12   million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and the next five years as follows: $  49   million in 2017, $  31   million in 2018, and $  19   million in each of the years 2019 through 2021. The amortization of the fair value adjustment on assumed long-term debt is recorded as a reduction to Interest expense in the Consolidated statements of operations. 

Net Investment Income 

Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. Net investment income increased   34.7 percent   and   27.7 percent   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared with the prior year periods. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition which added $312 million and $884 million of net investment income, respectively, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of liquidating investments to fund the acquisition, the unfavorable impact of amortizing the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to investments at the date of acquisition of $91 million and $292 million, respectively, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.

The investment portfolio s average market yield on fixed maturities was   2.2 percent   and   2.9 percent   at   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. Average market yield on fixed maturities represents the weighted average yield to maturity of our fixed income portfolio based on the market prices of the holdings at that date. 
    
  The   2.7 percent   and   2.4 percent   yield on short-term investments for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, reflects the global nature of our insurance operations.  
    
  For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the increase in net investment income from our equity securities reflects the higher invested assets as a result of the Chubb Corp acquisition.  

Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) 

We take a long-term view with our investment strategy, and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines designed to minimize risk. The majority of our investment portfolio is available for sale and reported at fair value. Our held to maturity investment portfolio is reported at amortized cost. 
    
  The effect of market movements on our available for sale investment portfolio impacts Net income (through Net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold or when we record an Other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charge in Net income. For a discussion related to how we assess OTTI for all of our investments, including credit-related OTTI, and the related impact on Net income, refer to Note   3   c) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, Net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of derivatives, including financial futures, options, swaps, and GLB reinsurance. Changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities resulting from the revaluation of securities held, changes in cumulative translation adjustment, and unrealized pension liability adjustment, are reported as separate components of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Shareholders  equity in the Consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  The following table presents our net realized and unrealized gains (losses):   

            (1)   
    For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , other-than-temporary impairments included   $7 million   for fixed maturities,   $1 million   for public equity, and   $4 million   for private equity. For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , other-than-temporary impairments included   $26 million   for fixed maturities,   $3 million   for public equity, and   $1 million   for private equity.

For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , other-than-temporary impairments included   $46 million   for fixed maturities,   $4 million   for public equity, and   $1 million   for private equity. 

Investments 

Our investment portfolio is invested primarily in publicly traded, investment grade, fixed income securities with an average credit quality of A/Aa as rated by the independent investment rating services Standard and Poor s (S P)/ Moody s Investors Service (Moody s). The portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional investment managers and is broadly diversified across geographies, sectors, and issuers. Other investments principally comprise direct investments, investment funds, and limited partnerships. We hold no collateralized debt obligations or collateralized loan obligations in our investment portfolio, and we provide no credit default protection. We have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization. Exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our Global Credit Committee, comprising senior executives, including our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Risk Officer, our Chief Investment Officer, and our Treasurer. We also have well-established, strict contractual investment rules requiring managers to maintain highly diversified exposures to individual issuers and closely monitor investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. 
    
  The average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of options and swaps, was   3.9   years and   3.5   years at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We estimate that a 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates would reduce the valuation of our fixed income portfolio by approximately   $3.8   billion at   September 30, 2016  .

The fair value of our total investments increased   $35.1 billion   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition, which added $43.0 billion at the date of acquisition, the investing of operating cash flows, and unrealized appreciation, partially offset by investments sold to fund the Chubb Corp acquisition. 
  The following tables present the market value of our fixed maturities and short-term investments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The first table lists investments according to type and second according to S P credit rating:

Mortgage-backed securities 

Municipal 
  As part of our overall investment strategy, we may invest in states, municipalities, and other political subdivisions fixed maturity securities (Municipal). We apply the same investment selection process described previously to our Municipal investments. The portfolio is highly diversified primarily in state general obligation bonds and essential service revenue bonds including education and utilities (water, power, and sewers).  
    
  Non-U.S. 
  Our exposure to the Euro results primarily from ACE European Group which is headquartered in London and offers a broad range of coverages throughout the European Union, Central, and Eastern Europe. Chubb primarily invests in Euro denominated investments to support its local currency insurance obligations and required capital levels. Chubb s local currency investment portfolios have strict contractual investment guidelines requiring managers to maintain a high quality and diversified portfolio to both sector and individual issuers. Investment portfolios are monitored daily to ensure investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. 
    
  Our non-U.S. investment grade fixed income portfolios are currency-matched with the insurance liabilities of our non-U.S. operations. The average credit quality of our non-U.S. fixed income securities is A and   55 percent   of our holdings are rated AAA or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies. Within the context of these investment portfolios, our government and corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies. Issuer limits are based on credit rating (AA   two   percent, A   one   percent, BBB   0.5   percent of the total portfolio) and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system. Because of this investment approach, we do not have a direct exposure to troubled sovereign borrowers in Europe. We manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating based investment approach. Accordingly, we do not believe our indirect exposure is material.

  Below-investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio 
  Below-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. Risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. Below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. Also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. At   September 30, 2016  , our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately   10 percent   of our fixed income portfolio. Our below-investment grade and non-rated portfolio includes over   1,100   issuers, with the greatest single exposure being   $185 million  . 
    
  We manage high-yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. The allocation to high-yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (BB/B). Our minimum rating for initial purchase is BB/B. Nine external investment managers are responsible for high-yield security selection

and portfolio construction. Our high-yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience. Holdings are highly diversified across industries and generally subject to a   1.5 percent   issuer limit as a percentage of high-yield allocation. We monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system. Derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes to our critical accounting estimates. For a full discussion of our critical accounting estimates, refer to Item 7 in our   2015   Form 10-K. 

Reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance 

(1)   
    Net of provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
       
  We evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and potential reinsurers on a regular basis and also monitor concentrations of credit risk with reinsurers. The provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the potential failure of reinsurers to indemnify us, primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies. The provision for uncollectible reinsurance is based on a default analysis applied to gross reinsurance recoverables, net of approximately $  3.2   billion and $  2.6   billion of collateral at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The increase in reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses was primarily due to the Chubb Corp acquisition.  

Unpaid losses and loss expenses 
  As an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required by applicable laws and regulations and GAAP to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. With the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims that are discounted in statutory filings, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. 
    
  The following table presents a roll-forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses:  

(1)   
    Net of provision for uncollectible reinsurance 
       
  Unpaid losses and loss expenses acquired from Chubb Corp included an increase of $715 million to adjust the carrying value of Chubb Corp's historical unpaid losses and loss expenses to fair value as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value consists of the present value of the expected net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses payments adjusted for an estimated risk margin. The expected cash flows are discounted at a risk free rate. The estimated risk margin varies based on the inherent risks associated with each type of reserve. This adjustment will be amortized to Amortization of purchased intangibles on the Consolidated statements of operations over a range of 5 to 17 years, based on the estimated payout pattern of the loss reserves as of the acquisition date.

The estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date (case reserves) and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. IBNR may also include provisions to account for the possibility that reported claims may settle for amounts that differ from the established case reserves. Loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses). 
    
  The following table presents our total reserves segregated between case reserves (including loss expense reserves) and IBNR reserves:  

Asbestos and Environmental (A E) 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, an internal review was conducted to evaluate the adequacy of environmental liabilities. As a result of the internal review, we increased environmental gross reserves for Brandywine managed operations by $103 million while the net loss reserves increased by $52 million. A E reserves are included in Corporate. Refer to Corporate in the Overview section and to our 2015 Form 10-K for further information on our A E exposures.

Assumed reinsurance programs involving minimum benefit guarantees under variable annuity contracts 
  Chubb reinsures various death and living benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities issued primarily in the United States and Japan.  
    
  We ceased writing this business in 2007. Guarantees which are payable on death are referred to as guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB). Guarantees on living benefits (GLB) includes guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB) and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (GMAB). For further description of this product and related accounting treatment, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  Guaranteed living benefits (GLB) derivatives 
  Our GLB reinsurance is classified as a derivative for accounting purposes and therefore carried at fair value. We believe that the most meaningful presentation of these GLB derivatives is as follows: 

Estimates of the average modeled value of future cash outflows is recorded as incurred losses (i.e., benefit reserves). Cash inflows or revenue are reported as net premiums earned and changes in the benefit reserves are reflected as Policy benefits expense in the Consolidated statements of operations, which is included in underwriting income. 
                
    The incremental difference between the fair value of GLB reinsurance contracts and benefit reserves is reflected in Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheets and related changes in fair value are reflected in Net realized gains (losses) in the Consolidated statements of operations.  
       
  Determination of GLB fair value  
  The fair value of GLB reinsurance is estimated using an internal valuation model, which includes current market information and estimates of policyholder behavior from the perspective of a theoretical market participant that would assume these liabilities. All of our treaties contain claim limits, which are factored into the valuation model. The fair value depends on a number of factors, including interest rates, equity markets, credit risk, current account value, market volatility, expected annuitization rates and other policyholder behavior, and changes in policyholder mortality. The model and related assumptions are regularly re-evaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of more timely market information. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products, actual experience may differ materially from the estimates reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  

95 

Table of Contents  

We intend to hold these derivative contracts to maturity (i.e., the expiration of the underlying liabilities through lapse, annuitization, death, or expiration of the reinsurance contract). To partially offset the risk of changes in the fair value of GLB reinsurance contracts, we invest in derivative hedge instruments.  At maturity, the cumulative realized gains and losses (excluding cumulative hedge gains or losses) from fair value changes of GLB reinsurance contracts will net to zero because, over time, the insurance liability will be increased or decreased to equal our obligation. 
    
  Determination of GLB and Guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) benefit reserves 
  Management established benefit reserves based on a long-term benefit ratio (or loss ratio) calculated using assumptions reflecting management s best estimate of the future short-term and long-term performance of the variable annuity line of business. Despite the long-term nature of the risk, the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be transient. Management regularly examines both qualitative and quantitative analysis, including a review of the differential between the benefit ratio used at the most recent valuation date and the benefit ratio calculated on subsequent dates. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and uses judgment to determine the extent to which assumptions underlying the benefit ratio calculation should be adjusted. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , management determined that no change to the benefit ratio was warranted. 
    
  For further information on the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of GLB reinsurance, refer to Note   4   to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our   2015   Form 10-K. For a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates, equity indices, and other assumptions on the fair value of GLBs, and the resulting impact on our net income, refer to Item 3. 
    
  Risk Management 
  We employ a strategy to manage the financial market and policyholder behavior risks embedded in the reinsurance of variable annuity (VA) guarantees. Risk management begins with underwriting a prospective client and guarantee design, with particular focus on protecting our position from policyholder options that, because of anti-selective behavior, could adversely impact our obligation. 
    
  A second layer of risk management is the structure of the reinsurance contracts. All VA guarantee reinsurance contracts include some form of annual or aggregate claim limit(s). For further information on the different categories of claim limits, refer to "Guaranteed living benefits derivatives" in our   2015   Form 10-K under Item 7. 
    
  A third layer of risk management is the hedging strategy which looks to mitigate both long-term economic loss over time as well as dampen income statement volatility. We owned financial market instruments as part of the hedging strategy with a fair value asset (liability) of $  4   million and $(4) million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The instruments are substantially collateralized by our counterparties, on a daily basis. 
    
  We also limit the aggregate amount of variable annuity reinsurance guarantee risk we are willing to assume. The last substantive transactions were quoted in late 2007. The aggregate number of policyholders is currently decreasing through policyholder withdrawals, annuitizations, and deaths at a rate of   5 percent   to   15 percent   per annum. 
    
  Note that GLB claims cannot occur for any reinsured policy until it has reached the end of its  waiting period .  As shown in the table below,   60 percent   of the policies we reinsure reached the end of their  waiting periods  prior to   September 30, 2016  . 

96 

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents the historical cash flows under these policies for the periods indicated. The amounts represent accrued past premium received and claims paid, split by benefit type. 

Collateral 
  Chubb holds collateral on behalf of most of its clients in the form of qualified assets in trust or letters of credit, typically in an amount sufficient for the client to obtain statutory reserve credit for the reinsurance. The timing of the calculation and amount of the collateral varies by client according to the particulars of the reinsurance treaty and the statutory reserve guidelines of the client s domicile. 
   
               Catastrophe management 

We actively monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world. The table below presents our modeled annual aggregate pre-tax probable maximum loss (PML), net of reinsurance, for 100-year and 250-year return periods for U.S. hurricane and California earthquake at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The table also presents Chubb s corresponding share of pre-tax industry PMLs for each of the return periods for U.S. hurricane and California earthquake. For example, according to the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our losses incurred in any year from U.S. hurricane events could be in excess of   $2,964   million (or   6.1   percent of our total shareholders  equity at   September 30, 2016  ). We estimate that at such hypothetical loss levels, Chubb s share of the aggregate industry PML would be approximately   2.1   percent. 

The above modeled loss information at September 30, 2016 reflects our in-force portfolio at July 1, 2016. Effective April 1, 2016 Chubb renewed its Global Property Catastrophe Program for our North American and International operations that provides global natural catastrophe and terrorism coverage. The September 30, 2016 modeled loss information reflects the April 1, 2016 reinsurance program as well as the inuring reinsurance protections coverage at July 1, 2016. Refer to  Natural catastrophe property reinsurance program  for additional information on our reinsurance program. 
    
  The modeling estimates of both Chubb and industry loss levels are inherently uncertain owing to key assumptions. First, while the use of third-party catastrophe modeling packages to simulate potential hurricane and earthquake losses is prevalent within the insurance industry, the models are reliant upon significant meteorology, seismology, and engineering assumptions to estimate hurricane and earthquake losses. In particular, modeled hurricane and earthquake events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential. Second, there is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models and the running of the modeling software. Third, we are reliant upon third-party estimates of industry insured exposures, and there is significant variation possible around the relationship between our loss and that of the industry following an event. Fourth, we assume that our reinsurance recoveries following an event are fully collectible. These loss estimates do not represent our potential maximum exposures, and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates.

Natural Catastrophe Property Reinsurance Program 

Chubb s core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations (i.e., excluding our Global Reinsurance and Life Insurance segments). 
    
  We regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures. This may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program s renewal date.  In addition, prior to each renewal date, we consider how much, if any, coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors, including modeled PML assessment at various return periods, reinsurance pricing, our risk tolerance and exposures, and various other structuring considerations. 
    
  Chubb purchases a Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program for our North American and International operations. The program is effective April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017, and consists of three layers in excess of losses retained by Chubb. In addition, we also purchased terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage, with an inclusion of coverage for biological and chemical coverage for personal lines) for the United States from April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017 with the same limits and retention and percentage placed except that the majority of terrorism coverage is on an aggregate basis above our retentions without a reinstatement.

(a)    Ultimate retention will depend upon the nature of the loss and the interplay between the underlying per risk programs and certain other catastrophe programs purchased by individual business units. These other catastrophe programs have the potential to reduce our effective retention below the stated levels.

Chubb also has two series of property catastrophe bonds in place (assumed as part of the Chubb Corp acquisition) that offer additional natural catastrophe protection for certain parts of the portfolio.  The geographic scope of this coverage is from Virginia through Maine. The East Lane VI 2014 series currently provides $270 million of coverage as part of a $300 million layer in excess of $3.453 billion retention through March 14, 2018. The East Lane VI 2015 series currently provides $250 million of coverage as part of a $500 million layer in excess of $2.602 billion retention through March 13, 2020. 

Crop Insurance 

We are, and have been since the 1980s, one of the leading writers of crop insurance in the U.S. and have conducted that business through a managing general agent subsidiary of Rain and Hail.  We provide protection throughout the U.S. on a variety of crops and are therefore geographically diversified, which reduces the risk of exposure to a single event or a heavy accumulation of losses in any one region.  Our crop insurance business comprises two components   Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) and crop-hail insurance.

     Table of Contents  

The MPCI program is offered in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The policies cover revenue shortfalls or production losses due to natural causes such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, frost, insects, and disease.  Generally, policies have deductibles ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent of the insured's risk.  The USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) sets the policy terms and conditions, rates and forms, and is also responsible for setting compliance standards.  As a participating company, we report all details of policies underwritten to the RMA and are party to a Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA).  The SRA sets out the relationship between private insurance companies and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) concerning the terms and conditions regarding the risks each will bear including the pro-rata and state stop-loss provisions which allows companies to limit the exposure of any one state or group of states on their underwriting results.  In addition to the pro-rata and excess of loss reinsurance protections inherent in the SRA, we also purchase third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance for our MPCI business to reduce our exposure.  We may also enter into crop derivative contracts to further manage our risk exposure. 
    
  Each year the RMA issues a final SRA for the subsequent reinsurance year.  In June 2016, the RMA released the 2017 SRA which establishes the terms and conditions for the 2017 reinsurance year (i.e., July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017) that replaced the 2016 SRA.  There were no significant changes in the terms and conditions, and therefore the new SRA does not impact Chubb's outlook on the crop program relative to 2017.  
    
  On the MPCI business, we recognize net premiums written as soon as estimable, which is generally when we receive acreage reports from the policyholders on the various crops throughout the U.S.  This allows us to best determine the premium associated with the liability that is being planted.  The MPCI program has specific timeframes as to when producers must report acreage to us and in certain cases, the reporting occurs after the close of the respective reinsurance year.  Once the net premium written has been recorded, the premium is then earned over the growing season for the crops.  A majority of the crops that are covered in the program are typically subject to the SRA in effect at the beginning of the year.  Given the major crops covered in the program, we typically see a substantial written and earned premium impact in the second and third quarters. 
    
  The pricing of MPCI premium is determined using a number of factors including commodity prices and related volatility.  For instance, in most states the pricing for the MPCI Revenue Product for corn includes a factor that is based on the average price in February of the Chicago Board of Trade December corn futures.  To the extent that the corn commodity prices are higher in February than they were in the previous February, and all other factors are the same, the increase in corn prices will increase the corn premium year over year. 
    
  Our crop-hail program is a private offering.  Premium is earned on the crop-hail program over the coverage period of the policy.  Given the very short nature of the growing season, most crop-hail business is typically written in the second and third quarters with the earned premium also more heavily occurring during this time frame.  We use industry data to develop our own rates and forms for the coverage offered.  The policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and/or fire, and related costs such as transit to storage.  We offer various deductibles to allow the grower to partially self-insure for a reduced premium cost.  We limit our crop-hail exposures through the use of township liability limits and third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance on our net retained hail business. 

Liquidity 

We anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term. In addition to cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements, we have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short-term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency. The programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption. Should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and an available $1.5 billion letter of credit/revolver facility. At   September 30, 2016  , our usage of this letter of credit was   $457 million  . Our access to funds under an existing credit facility is dependent on the ability of the bank that is a party to the facility to meet its funding commitments. Our existing credit facility has a remaining term expiring in November 2017 and requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, all of which we met at   September 30, 2016  . Should our existing credit provider experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. If we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facility  .   Refer to  Credit Facilities  in our   2015   Form 10-K for additional information.

The payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we were able to meet all of our obligations, including the payments of dividends on our Common Shares, with our net cash flows. 
    
  We assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. Considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary s financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. Chubb Limited received dividends of $5.0 billion from its Bermuda subsidiaries in 2015, of which $2.7 billion were paid in 2015, while the remaining $2.3 billion were paid during the first quarter of 2016. These dividends were used to finance a portion of the Chubb Corp acquisition by making capital contributions to Chubb INA and Chubb Group Holdings, both subsidiaries of Chubb Limited. In addition, Chubb Limited received dividends of $875 million and $15 million from its Bermuda subsidiaries during the   nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Chubb Limited received dividends of nil and $261 million from its Switzerland subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  The payment of any dividends from CGM or its subsidiaries is subject to applicable U.K. insurance laws and regulations. In addition, the release of funds by Syndicate 2488 to subsidiaries of CGM is subject to regulations promulgated by the Society of Lloyd s. The U.S. insurance subsidiaries of Chubb INA Holdings Inc. (Chubb INA) may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary s domicile (or, if applicable, commercial domicile). Chubb INA s international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. These laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. Chubb Limited received no dividends from CGM or Chubb INA during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Debt issued by Chubb INA is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by Chubb INA s insurance subsidiaries to Chubb INA as well as other group resources. Chubb INA received dividends of $1.2 billion and nil from its subsidiaries during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Chubb INA received $1.0 billion in capital contributions from Chubb Limited and $4.2 billion from Chubb Group Holdings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Chubb INA also received $5.1 billion in capital contributions in 2015, of which $2.8 billion were paid in 2015, while the remaining $2.3 billion were paid in 2016. $5.0 billion of these capital contributions were sourced from the dividends from the Bermuda subsidiaries to fund the Chubb Corp acquisition as noted above.  

Cash Flows 
  Our sources of liquidity include cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. The following is a discussion of our cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Operating cash flows were   $3.84 billion   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $2.70 billion   in the prior year period. The $  1,138 million   increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to cash flow contributions from legacy Chubb Corp operations, partially offset by integration expenses paid and higher interest paid on long-term debt. 
    
  Cash used for investing was   $4.27 billion   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with   $1.43 billion   in the prior year period. The increase in cash used for investing of $  2,849 million   was primarily due to cash paid for the purchase of Chubb Corp of $14.25 billion, which was largely funded by sales in our investment portfolio, including net proceeds in short-term investments which offset the cash paid for Chubb Corp.  The prior year cash used for investing included cash paid for the purchase of the Fireman's Fund of $365 million, which when netted with cash acquired of $620 million, resulted in a net $255 million of cash inflow. 
    
  Cash used for financing was   $510 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared with   $777 million   in the prior year period. The current year included $851 million of dividends paid on common shares reflecting our higher outstanding share count following the Chubb Corp acquisition, partially offset by policyholder deposits, net of withdrawals, of $226 million. The prior year included $644 million of dividends paid on common shares, $758 million of shares repurchased, and $451 million for the repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $800 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. 
    
  Both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Claim settlements, premium levels, and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. In many  

100 

     Table of Contents  

cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the settlement of the liability for that loss. 
    
  In the current low interest rate environment, we use repurchase agreements as a low-cost alternative for short-term funding needs and to address short-term cash timing differences without disrupting our long-term investment portfolio holdings. At   September 30, 2016  , there were $  1.4 billion   in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next 4 months. 

Capital Resources 

Capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations.  

In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for debt issuance costs.  The new guidance requires presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge.  We retrospectively adopted this guidance effective first quarter of 2016 and reclassified $60 million of debt issuance costs from Other assets to Long-term debt ($58 million) and Trust preferred securities ($2 million) as of December 31, 2015 to conform to the current period presentation. 
    
  On January 14, 2016, we acquired Chubb Corp for approximately $29.5 billion, comprising $14.3 billion in cash and $15.2 billion in newly-issued stock, based on the Chubb Limited (formerly ACE Limited) closing price on the acquisition date. In addition, we assumed outstanding equity awards to employees and directors with an attributed value of approximately $323 million. The total consideration, including assumption of equity awards, was $29.8 billion. We financed the cash portion of the transaction through a combination of $9.0 billion sourced from various Chubb Limited and Chubb Corp companies plus $5.3 billion of senior notes, which were issued in November 2015. Refer to Note   2   and Note   7   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition and the $5.3 billion of senior notes, respectively. 
    
  As part of the acquisition, we assumed Chubb Corp s senior and subordinated debt obligations, totaling $3.3 billion par value (fair valued at $3.8 billion at the acquisition date), which is guaranteed by Chubb Limited. Included in the debt obligations are junior subordinated capital securities of $1.0 billion that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.375 percent through April 14, 2017 and at a rate equal to the three-month Libor rate plus 2.25 percent thereafter. If the current three-month Libor rate is not substantially higher in early 2017, and the near-term expectations are similar, it is our expectation that these securities would not be redeemed at the reset date. However, our expectations are subject to change depending on market conditions and other factors. 
    
  In February 2016, we reclassified $500 million of 5.7 percent senior notes, due to mature in February 2017, from Long-term debt to Short-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased $734 million of Common Shares in a series of open market transactions under the Board of Directors (Board) authorization which expired on December 31, 2015. There are no outstanding repurchase authorizations subsequent to December 31, 2015. At this time, management has elected to discontinue share repurchases. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   14,497,754   Common Shares in treasury with a weighted average cost of   $106.92   per share.

We generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via an unlimited Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shelf registration which is renewed every three years. This allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs. In October 2015, we filed a new unlimited shelf registration which allows us to issue certain classes of debt and equity. This shelf registration expires in October 2018.  
    
  Dividends 
  We have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in 1993. Under Swiss law, dividends must be stated in Swiss francs though dividend payments are made by Chubb in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note   9   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our dividend methodology.  
    
  At our May 2016 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $2.76 per share, or CHF 2.72 per share, calculated using the USD/CHF exchange rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on May 19, 2016, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.69 per share after the general meeting by way of a distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. The Board will determine the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2017 annual general meeting, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at their discretion. The annual dividend approved in May 2016 represented an $0.08 per share increase ($0.02 per quarter) over the prior year dividend. 
    
  The following table represents dividends paid per Common Share to shareholders of record on each of the following dates:    

ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management 
  Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments.  We are exposed to potential losses from various market risks including changes in interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.  Further, through writing the GLB and GMDB products, we are exposed to volatility in the equity and credit markets, as well as interest rates. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities, denominated in both U.S. dollars and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our fixed income portfolio is classified as available for sale. The effect of market movements on our available for sale investment portfolio impacts Net income (through Net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold or when we record an OTTI charge in Net income. Changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate effect on Shareholders' equity and Comprehensive income and in certain instances, Net income. From time to time, we also use derivative instruments such as futures, options, swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our notional exposure to derivative instruments was $  5.0 billion     and $3.1 billion, respectively. These instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and are sensitive to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity security prices. As part of our investing activities, we from time to time purchase to be announced mortgage backed securities (TBAs). Changes in the fair value of TBAs are included in Net realized gains (losses) and therefore, have an immediate effect on both our Net income and Shareholders' equity.  
    
  We seek to mitigate market risk using a number of techniques, including maintaining and managing the assets and liabilities of our international operations consistent with the foreign currencies of the underlying insurance and reinsurance businesses, thereby limiting exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies.   
    
  The following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at   September 30, 2016  . Our policies to address these risks in 2016 were not materially different from 2015. We do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk  

102 

     Table of Contents  

exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods. 
    
  Interest rate risk   fixed income portfolio and debt obligations 
  Our fixed income portfolio and debt obligations have exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in investment values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves and debt obligations. We monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our asset and liability positions. 
    
  The following table presents the impact at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , on the fair value of our fixed income portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 bps applied instantly across the U.S. yield curve (an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario): 

Changes in interest rates will have an immediate effect on Comprehensive income and Shareholders' equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on Net income. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of prepayments due to available prepayment options. For these reasons, actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables. 
    
  Changes in interest rates could have a material impact on our debt and trust preferred securities fair value, albeit there would be no impact on our consolidated financial statements.   
    
  The following table presents the impact at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , on the fair value of our debt obligations of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 bps applied instantly across the U.S. yield curve (an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario): 

Foreign currency management 
  As a global company, Chubb entities transact business in multiple currencies. Our policy is to generally match assets, liabilities and required capital for each individual jurisdiction in local currency, which would include the use of derivatives. We do not hedge our net asset non-U.S. dollar capital positions; however, we do consider hedging for planned cross border transactions. 

103 

Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the net assets in non-U.S. currencies at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015: 

(1)       At   September 30, 2016  , net assets denominated in foreign currencies comprised approximately 41% tangible assets and 59% intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The increase in foreign denominated net assets is due to the Chubb Corp acquisition. 
    
  Reinsurance of GMDB and GLB guarantees 
  Chubb views its variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small, at the time of pricing. Adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income. When evaluating these risks, we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss, as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements. Therefore, we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term economic risk and reward. 
    
  Net income is directly impacted by changes in benefit reserves calculated in connection with reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees, primarily GMDB and GLB. In addition, net income is directly impacted by changes in the fair value of the GLB liability (FVL), which is classified as a derivative for accounting purposes. The FVL established for a GLB reinsurance contract represents the difference between the fair value of the contract and the benefit reserves. Benefit reserves and FVL calculations are directly affected by market factors, including equity levels, interest rate levels, credit risk, and implied volatilities, as well as policyholder behaviors, such as annuitization and lapse rates. 
    
  The tables below are estimates of the sensitivities to instantaneous changes in economic inputs (e.g., equity shock, interest rate shock etc.) or actuarial assumptions at   September 30, 2016   of the FVL and of the fair value of specific derivative instruments held (hedge value) to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio. The following assumptions should be considered when using the below tables:  

No changes to the benefit ratio used to establish benefit reserves at   September 30, 2016 

Equity shocks impact all global equity markets equally 
                
    Our liabilities are sensitive to global equity markets in the following proportions:   70   percent   80   percent U.S. equity,   10   percent   20   percent international equity ex-Japan, up to   10   percent Japan equity.  
                
    Our current hedge portfolio is sensitive to global equity markets in the following proportions:   100 percent   U.S. equity. 
                
    We would suggest using the S P 500 index as a proxy for U.S. equity, the MSCI EAFE index as a proxy for international equity, and the TOPIX as a proxy for Japan equity. 

104 

     Table of Contents  

Interest rate shocks assume a parallel shift in the U.S. yield curve  
                
    Our liabilities are also sensitive to global interest rates at various points on the yield curve, mainly the U.S. Treasury curve in the following proportions: up to   10   percent short-term rates (maturing in less than 5 years),   20   percent   30   percent medium-term rates (maturing between 5 years and 10 years, inclusive), and   70   percent   80   percent long-term rates (maturing beyond 10 years).  
                
    A change in AA-rated credit spreads (AA-rated credit spreads are a proxy for both our own credit spreads and the credit spreads of the ceding insurers) impacts the rate used to discount cash flows in the fair value model.  

The sensitivities are not directly additive because changes in one factor will affect the sensitivity to changes in other factors.  The sensitivities do not scale linearly and may be proportionally greater for larger movements in the market factors. The sensitivities may also vary due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The calculation of the FVL is based on internal models that include assumptions regarding future policyholder behavior, including lapse, annuitization, and asset allocation. These assumptions impact both the absolute level of the FVL as well as the sensitivities to changes in market factors shown below. Actual sensitivity of our net income may differ from those disclosed in the tables below due to differences between short-term market movements and management judgment regarding the long-term assumptions implicit in our benefit ratios. Furthermore, the sensitivities below could vary by multiples of the sensitivities in the tables below. 

In addition, the tables below do not reflect the expected quarterly run rate of net income generated by the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio if markets remain unchanged during the period. All else equal, if markets remain unchanged during the period, the Gross FVL will increase, resulting in a realized loss. The realized loss occurs primarily because, during the period, we will collect premium on the full population while only   60   percent of that population has become eligible to annuitize and generate a claim (since approximately   40   percent of policies are not eligible to annuitize until after   September 30, 2016  ). This increases the Gross FVL because future premiums are lower by the amount collected in the quarter, and also because future claims are discounted for a shorter period. We refer to this increase in Gross FVL as  timing effect . The unfavorable impact of timing effect on our Gross FVL in a quarter is not reflected in the sensitivity tables below. For this reason, when using the tables below to estimate the sensitivity of Gross FVL in the third quarter to various changes, it is necessary to assume an additional   $5   million to   $45   million increase in Gross FVL and realized losses. However, the impact to Net income is substantially mitigated because the majority of this realized loss is offset by the positive quarterly run rate of Life underwriting income generated by the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio if markets remain unchanged during the period. Note that both the timing effect and the quarterly run rate of Life underwriting income change over time as the book ages.

ITEM 4.  Controls and Procedures 

Chubb s management, with the participation of Chubb s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Chubb s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of September 30, 2016.  Based upon that evaluation, which excluded the impact of the acquisition of The Chubb Corporation discussed below, Chubb s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Chubb s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in allowing information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to be recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Chubb s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

During the first quarter 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of The Chubb Corporation (Legacy Chubb). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Legacy Chubb represented approximately 31 percent and 34 percent of consolidated revenues, respectively, and approximately 40 percent and 46 percent of pre-tax income, respectively. At September 30, 2016, Legacy Chubb represented approximately 40 percent of total assets.  We currently exclude, and are in the process of working to incorporate, Legacy Chubb in our evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting and related disclosure controls and procedures. 
    
  Other than working to incorporate Legacy Chubb as mentioned above, there has been no change in Chubb s internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Chubb s internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
   
               ITEM 1.  Legal Proceedings 

The information required with respect to this item is included in Note   8   g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements which is hereby incorporated by reference. 

ITEM 1A.  Risk Factors 

The following supplements the risk factors that could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as described under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part I of our   2015   Form 10-K.  
    
  Political uncertainty in the United Kingdom and the European Union may lead to volatility and/or have an adverse effect on our business, our liquidity and financial condition, and our stock price. 
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the European Union. The result of the referendum does not legally obligate the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, and it is unclear if or when the United Kingdom will formally serve notice to the European Council of its desire to withdraw, a process that is unprecedented in European Union history, and one that could involve months or years of negotiation to draft and approve a withdrawal agreement in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.  
    
  Regardless of any eventual timing or terms of the United Kingdom s exit from the European Union, the June referendum has created significant political, social, and macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result of this uncertainty, in the immediate wake of the UK referendum, stock exchange indices around the world, and in the United Kingdom in particular, declined significantly. In addition, the pound sterling experienced sharp depreciation following the vote. Refer to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk under Part I, Item 3 for additional information on our foreign currency management. Also, within one day of the referendum, Moody s, Fitch and S P each downgraded the outlook of the UK government s bond rating from stable to negative warning that the country s economic growth and fiscal strength are likely to be lower in the event the United Kingdom exits the European Union.  
    
  The possible exit of the United Kingdom (or any other country) from the European Union, the potential withdrawal of Scotland or Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom, or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to any of these possibilities could result in significant macroeconomic deterioration including, but not limited to, further decreases in global stock exchange indices, increased foreign exchange volatility (in particular a further weakening of the pound sterling and euro against other leading currencies), decreased GDP in the United Kingdom, and a downgrade of the United Kingdom s sovereign credit rating. In addition, there are increasing concerns that these events could push the United Kingdom, Eurozone, and/or United States into an economic recession any of which, were they to occur, would further destabilize the global financial markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have significant operations in the UK and other EU member states. Depending on the final terms of the UK exit, we may be required to reorganize our operations and legal entity structure in the UK and the EU in a manner that could be less efficient and more expensive.  
    
  The result of the June referendum has also raised concerns regarding the terms for future UK access to the EU Single Market, which is made up of the 27 other EU member states and, to some extent, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (together, the European Economic Area or EEA). The rules governing the EU Single Market requires local risks to be underwritten by a local authorized insurer; an EEA authorized insurer or a non-local insurer with the benefit of an EU  passport . As such, UK insurers, including us, are able to underwrite risks from the UK into EEA member states via a  passport . In the event that, following the  

107 

Table of Contents  

UK s withdrawal from the EU, UK insurers were unable to access the EU Single Market via a passporting arrangement, a regulatory equivalence regime or other similar arrangement, such insurers may not be able to underwrite risks into EEA member states except through local branches incorporated in the EEA. Such branches might require local authorization, regulatory and prudential supervision, and capital to be deposited. Any change to the terms of the UK s access to the EU Single Market following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
    
  In addition, Lloyd s currently benefits from EU Single Market passporting arrangements, which allow its syndicates and     coverholders to write business in EEA member states. Lloyd s might not be able to maintain such passporting rights or equivalent rights following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, which could restrict our ability to write business in the EEA through Lloyd s syndicates and coverholders and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
