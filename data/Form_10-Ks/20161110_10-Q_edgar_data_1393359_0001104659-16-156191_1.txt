   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (unaudited)  
     
  1.                             ORGANIZATION 
     
  Man FRM Managed Futures Strategies LLC (the  Fund ), a Delaware limited liability company, is a managed futures fund of funds managed by FRM Investment Management (USA) LLC (the  Manager  or  FRM ). FRM is registered as a commodity pool operator ( CPO ) and commodity trading adviser ( CTA ) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) under the Commodity Exchange Act.  FRM is also registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. FRM is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Man Group plc ( Man Group ). The Fund was organized under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act in March 2007 and commenced operations in April 2007. The Fund is an investment company as defined by Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) guidance. The Fund was previously known as  Systematic Momentum FuturesAccess LLC  through April 30, 2015.  
     
  Prior to May 1, 2015, the Fund was a participating fund in the FuturesAccess  SM  Program ( FuturesAccess ) sponsored by Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments LLC ( MLAI ). The Fund operated as a  fund of funds , allocating and reallocating its capital among underlying FuturesAccess Funds ( FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds  or  Portfolio Funds ). MLAI was the sponsor and manager of the Fund prior to May 1, 2015. MLAI is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation. 
     
  Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of December 8, 2014 between MLAI and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Man Group, as amended, the Man Group purchased, among other assets, the rights of MLAI and its affiliates under certain agreements relating to the management of the Fund. FRM replaced MLAI as manager of the Fund on May 1, 2015, upon the closing of such purchase. Effective as of May 1, 2015, the Fund was renamed  Man FRM Managed Futures Strategies LLC.   
     
  Under the direction of the Manager, the Fund allocates its capital among a group of underlying related party funds (each an  Underlying Fund , and collectively the  Underlying Funds ) which, in turn, allocate capital to related party master funds (each a  Master Fund  and collectively the  Master Funds ) that implement a systematic-based managed futures strategy under the direction of related party commodity trading advisors (each a  Trading Advisor  and collectively, the  Trading Advisors ).  
     
  The Manager invests the Fund s assets in Underlying Funds that are on the FRM platform. The Underlying Funds invested by the Fund are established as Delaware limited liability companies, each of which engages the Manager as the risk manager and each of which further invests in a Master Fund, established as a Cayman Islands exempted company, which engages a single Trading Advisor (see Note 2). As of September 30, 2016, there are six Underlying Funds (see Note 2) held by the Fund. The Manager serves as CPO of the Underlying Funds and Master Funds.

Table of Contents   
     
  Unless the context requires otherwise, references in these financial statements notes to the Fund, also refer to the Underlying Funds and the Master Funds in which the Underlying Funds invest. Reference to the investment process, strategies, objectives or activities of the Fund and the Underlying Funds refer to the investment activities of the Master Funds through which the Underlying Funds and Fund indirectly conduct their investment processes, strategies, objectives and activities. Additionally, references to the Underlying Funds that follow are also related to the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds during the period prior to May 1, 2015.  
     
  Interests in the Fund are not insured or otherwise protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government authority. Interests are not deposits or other obligations of, and are not guaranteed by any bank. Interests are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the full amount invested.  
     
  The Fund considers all highly liquid investments, with a maturity of three months or less when acquired, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Fund does not hold any cash equivalents. Cash is held at a nationally recognized financial institution.  
     
  In the opinion of management, these unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position of the Fund as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the results of its operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. However, the operating results for the interim periods may not be indicative of the results for the full year.  
     
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been omitted. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Fund s report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 201 5. 
     
   Estimates   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material.  
     
   Income Taxes   
     
  No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements as each member is individually responsible for reporting income or loss based on such member s share of the Fund s income and expenses as reported for income tax purposes.  
     
  The Fund follows the ASC guidance on accounting for uncertain tax positions.  This guidance provides how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements.  This guidance also requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund s financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the applicable tax   
     
 10

  authority.  Tax positions with respect to tax at the Fund level not deemed to meet the  more-likely-than-not  threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. A prospective investor should be aware that, among other things, income taxes could have a material adverse effect on the periodic calculations of the net asset value ( NAV ) of the Fund, including reducing the NAV of the Fund to reflect reserves for income taxes, such as foreign withholding taxes, that may be payable by the Fund or the Underlying Funds. This could cause benefits or detriments to certain investors, depending upon the timing of their entry and exit from the Fund. The Manager has analyzed the Fund s tax positions and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund s financial statements. The following is the major tax jurisdiction for the Fund and the earliest tax year subject to examination: United States   2013.  
     
   Subscriptions   
     
  The Fund generally offers units ( Units ) for investment each Monday (or, where such day is not a business day, the immediately following business day) and/or such other days as the Manager may determine in its sole discretion (each a  Subscription Day ). Investors must submit their executed subscription agreement five business days prior to the Subscription Day.  Investors  subscriptions will be used to purchase a number of Units, including fractional Units, with an aggregate NAV, equal to the dollar amount invested.  
     
  Each member shares in the profits and losses of the Fund in proportion to the number of units held by each member. However, no member is liable for obligations of the Fund in excess of its capital subscription and net profits or losses, if any. Except as described in Note 5 below in respect of fees, the classes of units are identical.  
     
   Redemptions   
     
  Investors in the Fund generally may redeem any or all of their Units at NAV, in whole or fractional Units, effective as of (i) each Friday (or, where such day is not a business day, the immediate following business day) and/or (ii) such other days as the Manager may determine in its sole discretion (each a  Redemption Day ), upon providing notice to the Fund in writing (or in such other manner as the Manager may determine in its sole discretion) not less than four business days prior to the Redemption Day. The NAV of redeemed Units is determined as of the Redemption Date. Investors will remain exposed to fluctuations in NAV during the period between submission of their redemption requests and the applicable Redemption Day.  
     
   New Accounting Pronouncement   
     
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)  ( ASU 2014-15 ). The pronouncement determines management s responsibility regarding assessment of the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern, even if the Fund s liquidation is not imminent. Currently, no similar guidance exists. Under this guidance, during each period in which financial statements are prepared, management needs to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that, in aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the Fund s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. Substantial doubt exists if these conditions or events indicate that the Fund will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due. If such conditions or events exist, management should develop a plan to mitigate or alleviate these conditions or events. Regardless of management s plan to mitigate, certain disclosures must be made in the financial statements.

Table of Contents   
     
  ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, however, early adoption is permitted. The Fund is currently evaluating the impact the update will have on the Fund s financial statements.  
     
  2.                             INVESTMENTS IN UNDERLYING FUNDS 
     
  During 2015 , the Fund held investments in the following MLAI Portfolio Funds: Aspect FuturesAccess LLC ( Aspect ), ML BlueTrend FuturesAccess LLC ( BlueTrend ), John Locke FuturesAccess LLC ( John Locke ), Lynx FuturesAccess LLC ( Lynx ), ML Transtrend DTP  Enhanced FuturesAccess LLC ( Transtrend ), Tudor Tensor FuturesAccess LLC ( Tudor ) and ML Winton FuturesAccess LLC ( Winton ). As of April 30, 2015, the Fund fully redeemed its investments in the MLAI Portfolio Funds. 
     
  During May 2015, the Fund invested in a new group of Underlying Funds. As of September 30, 2016, t he six Underlying Funds in which the Fund is invested in, and the respective Master Funds in which the Underlying Funds are invested in, are: (i) Blakeney Delaware Feeder LLC ( Blakeney ) which invests in Blakeney Fund Limited, (ii) Campbell Delaware Feeder LLC ( Campbell ) which invests in Campbell MAC Cayman Fund Limited, (iii) CCP Core Macro Delaware Feeder LLC ( CCP Core Macro ) which invests in CCP Core Macro Cayman Fund Limited, (iv) Century Cat Mac Delaware Feeder LLC ( Century CAT ) which invests in Century CAT MAC Cayman Fund Limited, (v) Quantica MF Delaware Feeder LLC ( Quantica MF ) which invests in Quantica MF Cayman Fund Limited, and (vi) Silver Delaware Feeder LLC ( Silver ) which invests in Silver MAC Limited.  As used herein, Trading Advisor in respect of an Underlying Fund refers to the Trading Advisor of its related Master Fund. FRM, in its discretion, may change the Underlying Funds at any time. FRM, also at its discretion, may vary the percentage of the Fund s total portfolio allocated to the different Underlying Funds. In the process of rebalancing, the Fund s allocation to any individual Underlying Fund may range between 3% - 25% of the Fund s Net Asset Value ( NAV ). 
     
  During the period, the Fund had purchases of $48,460,000 and sales of $53,931,829 of investments in Underlying Funds. The investment transactions were accounted for on trade date. The investments in the Underlying Funds are valued at fair value and are reflected in the Statements of Financial Condition. In determining fair value, FRM utilized the NAV of the Underlying Funds which approximates fair value. The fair value was net of all fees relating to the Underlying Funds, paid or accrued. Additionally, FRM monitored the performance of the Underlying Funds. Such monitoring procedures included, but were not limited to: monitoring market movements in the Underlying Funds  investments, comparing performance to industry benchmarks, and conference calls and site visits with the Trading Advisors. The fair value of the Fund s assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented on the Statements of Financial Condition.

  3.                             FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS 
     
  Fair value of an investment is the amount that would be received to sell the investment in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e. the exit price). Purchase and sale of investments are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized profits and losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold. Any change in net unrealized profit or loss from the preceding period/year is reported in the respective Statements of Operations.  
     
  The fair value measurement guidance established by U.S. GAAP is a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring investments at fair value. Market price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of investment and the characteristics specific to the investment. Investments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.  
     
  Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:  
     
  Level I   Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The type of investments included in Level I are publicly traded investments. As required by the fair market value measurement guidance in U.S. GAAP, the Fund does not adjust the quoted price for these investments even in situations where the Fund holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.  
     
  Level II   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of generally accepted and understood models or other valuation methodologies.  
     
 15   

Table of Contents   
     
  Level III   Pricing inputs are unobservable and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. Fair value for these investments is determined using valuation methodologies that consider a range of factors, including but not limited to the nature of the investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, these values may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these investments existed.  
     
  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. FRM s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment.  
     
  In May 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2015-07  Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)    Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) .  This guidance no longer requires investments for which fair value is determined based on practical expedient reliance to be reported utilizing the fair value hierarchy. Although ASU 2015-07 ( the amendment ) is effective beginning in the first quarter of 2016, with early adoption being permitted, the Manager had elected to adopt the amendment in August 2015, and the impact of adoption is limited to the notes to the financial statements.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all of the investments were fair valued using the NAV as practical expedient of the Underlying Funds.  
     
  4.                             MARKET, CREDIT AND CONCENTRATION RISKS 
     
  The nature of this Fund has certain risks, which cannot all be presented in the financial statements.  The following summarizes certain of those risks.  
     
   Market Risk   
     
  Derivative instruments involve varying degrees of market risk. Changes in the level or volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or the market values of the financial instruments or commodities underlying such derivative instruments frequently result in changes in the  Master Funds  financial assets (liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss on such derivative instruments as reflected in the Statements of Financial Condition of the Master Funds. The Fund s exposure to market risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the relationships among the derivative instruments held by the Master Funds as well as the volatility and liquidity of the markets in which the derivative instruments are traded.  Investments in foreign markets may also entail legal and political risks. 
     
   Credit Risk   
     
  The risks associated with exchange-traded contracts are typically perceived to be less than those associated with over-the-counter (non-exchange-traded) transactions, because exchanges typically (but not universally) provide clearinghouse arrangements in which the collective credit   
     
 16   

Table of Contents   
     
   (in some cases limited in amount, in some cases not) of the members of the exchange/clearinghouse is pledged to support the financial integrity of the exchange/clearinghouse.  In over-the-counter transactions, on the other hand, traders must rely solely on the credit of their respective individual    counterparties. Margins, which may be subject to loss in the event of a default, are generally required in exchange traded contracts, and in the over-the-counter markets counterparties may also require margin. 
     
  The credit risk associated with these instruments from counterparty nonperformance is  the derivatives, at fair value, if any, included in the Master Funds  Statements of Financial Condition. 
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Underlying Funds held by the Fund do not invest directly in positions other than their related Master Funds. The Master Funds enter into contracts with various futures clearing brokers. These brokers may encounter financial difficulties that can impair the operating capabilities or the capital position of the Master Funds, and in turn, the Underlying Funds. The Trading Advisors of the Master Funds will attempt to limit transactions to well-capitalized and established brokers in an effort to mitigate such risk.  
     
  Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur from the failure of a counterparty to make payments according to the terms of a contract. The Fund s exposure to credit risk is contingent upon the Underlying Funds and the brokers and counterparties which the Underlying Funds transact business with as well as amounts recorded as assets in the Statements of Financial Condition.  
     
  Cash held as deposits may exceed the amount of federal insurance provided on such deposits and are therefore subject to credit risk.  
     
   Concentration Risk   
     
  The Fund s investments in the Underlying Funds are subject to the market and credit risk of the Underlying Funds. Because the majority of the Fund s capital is invested in the Underlying Funds, any changes in the market conditions that would adversely affect the Underlying Funds could significantly impact the solvency of the Fund.  
     
   Indemnifications   
     
  The  Fund enters into administrative and other professional service contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications.  The Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is not known; however, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
     
  5.                             RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
     
  MLAI and the Fund entered into a transfer agency and investor services agreement with Financial Data Services, Inc. (the  Former Transfer Agent ), an affiliate of MLAI, which was in place through April 30, 2015. The fees charged by the Former Transfer Agent for its services were based on the aggregate net assets of funds managed or sponsored by MLAI. The fee rate ranged from 0.016% to 0.02% per year of the aggregate net assets managed or sponsored by MLAI.  Effective as of May 1, 2015, The Bank of New York Mellon, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York, through its Alternative Investment Services division   
     
 17   

Table of Contents   
     
  ( AIS ), serves as the administrator, registrar and transfer agent ( New Transfer Agent ) for the Fund pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement. The New Transfer Agent provides registrar, distribution disbursing agent, transfer agent and certain other services related to the issuance, redemption, exchange and transfer of units.  The New Transfer Agent is not a related party of the Fund.  
     
  The Former Transfer Agent fee allocated to the Fund for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $0 and $15,178, respectively.  
     
  The Manager receives monthly management fees ( Management Fees ) based on the aggregate NAV of the Class of Units. The respective Management Fee rates are: Class A Units 1.5% per annum; Class C Units 2.5% per annum; and Class I Units 1.1% per annum. Class D Units and Class M Units are not charged Management Fees.  Prior to May 1, 2015, management fees were known as sponsor fees and were paid to MLAI.  
     
  Effective August 19, 2015, three new classes were offered by the Fund.  The respective Management Fee for these classes are: Class AA units 2.5% per annum; Class II units 1.35% per annum; Class MM units 0.60% per annum.  
     
  6.                             WEIGHTED AVERAGE UNITS 
     
  The weighted average number of Units outstanding for each Class is computed for purposes of disclosing net income (loss) per weighted average Unit. The weighted average number of Units outstanding for each Class for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 equals the Units outstanding as of such date, adjusted proportionately for Units sold or redeemed based on the respective length of time each was outstanding during the period.  
     
  7.                             SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
     
  Subsequent events were evaluated from October 1, 2016 to November 10, 2016, the Fund has recorded redemptions of approximately $4,777,178.  
     
  Management has evaluated the impact of subsequent events on the Fund through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there were no additional subsequent events that require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the financial statements.  
     
  Item 2:  Management s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations    
     
  Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Form 10-Q to the Fund also refer to the Underlying Funds and the Master Funds in which the Underlying Funds invest.  Reference to the investment process, strategies, objectives and activities of the Fund and the Underlying Funds refer to the investment activities of the Master Funds through which the Underlying Funds and Fund indirectly conduct their investment processes, strategies, objectives and activities.

  NET ASSET VALUE PER UNIT  
     
  The NAV of the Fund is equivalent to its total assets less its total liabilities as of any valuation day.  Appreciation or depreciation in the NAV of the Fund is based upon appreciation or depreciation in the value of investments in Underlying Funds that are held by the Fund, with appropriate adjustments for assets and liabilities of the Fund. The different Classes of Units will have a different NAV due to the different Management Fees charged to these Classes.  The NAV is calculated on the last calendar day of each month and/or last business day of each week as the Manager may determine in its sole discretion.  
     
  FRM believes that the NAV used to calculate subscription and redemption value and to report performance to investors is a useful performance measure for the investors of the Fund.  The charts below reference NAV at the specified valuation dates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
     
  The Fund and the Underlying Funds through their related Master Funds borrow only to a limited extent and only on a strictly short-term basis in order to finance losses on non-U.S. dollar denominated trading positions pending the conversion of the Fund s and Underlying Funds  U.S. dollar deposits. These borrowings are at a prevailing short-term rate in the relevant currency.  
     
  An Underlying Fund through its Master Fund should be able to close out its open trading positions and liquidate its holdings relatively quickly and at market prices, except in unusual circumstances. This typically permits the Underlying Fund to limit losses as well as reduce market exposure on short notice should its strategies indicate doing so.  
     
   There is no established public trading market for the Units.  Investors in the Fund generally may redeem any or all of their Units at NAV, in whole or fractional Units, effective as of each Friday ( or, where such day is not a business day, the immediately following business day) and/or such  
     
 21   

Table of Contents   
     
  other days as the Manager may determine in its sole discretion ( Redemption Day ), upon submitting a redemption request by the  Redemption Notice Date,  which is four business days prior to the Redemption Date.  The NAV of redeemed Units is determined as of the Redemption Day. Investors will remain exposed to fluctuations in NAV during the period between submission of their redemption request and the applicable Redemption Day.  
     
  As a commodity pool, the Fund maintains a large percentage of its assets in cash directly and indirectly through the underlying Master Funds, which they must have available to post initial and variation margin on futures contracts.  This cash is also used to fund redemptions.  While the Underlying Funds have the ability to fund redemption proceeds from liquidating the Master Funds  positions, as a practical matter positions are not liquidated to fund redemptions.  In the event that positions were liquidated to fund redemptions, FRM has the ability to override decisions of the Trading Advisor to fund redemptions if necessary, but in practice the Trading Advisor would determine, in its discretion which investments should be liquidated.  
     
   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Fund s capital decreased 16.65% from $160,781,732  to $134,014,115.  This decrease was attributable to the net loss from operations of $842,160, coupled with the redemption of 29,478,301 Units resulting in an outflow of $32,514,324.  The cash outflow was offset with cash inflow of $6,588,867 due to subscriptions of 6,221,528 Units. Future redemptions could impact the amount of funds available for investment in the Underlying Funds in subsequent months.  
     
  Critical Accounting Policies  
     
  Statement of Cash Flows  
     
  The Fund is not required to provide a Statement of Cash Flows.  
     
  Investments  
     
  Purchase and sale of investments are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized profits and losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold. Any change in net unrealized profit or loss from the preceding period is reported in the respective Statements of Operations.  
     
  Fair Value Measurements  
     
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  For more information on the Fund s treatment of fair value, see Financial Statements Note 3, Fair Value of Investments.  
     
  Reform Act  
     
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended the definition of  eligible contract participant  and each Master Fund expects to meet the amended definition as it applies to trading in  retail forex  transactions so long as its total assets exceed $10 million.  If the Master Fund does not meet the definition of  eligible contract participant  for purposes of trading in  retail forex  transactions, it could lead to the Master Fund being unable to trade such transactions in the interbank market and bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less   
     
 22   

Table of Contents   
     
  favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees.   Retail forex  markets available to parties that do not meet the definition of  eligible contract participant  could also be significantly less liquid than the interbank market.  Moreover, the creditworthiness of the counterparties with whom the Master Fund may be required to trade in such circumstances could be significantly weaker than the creditworthiness of the currency forward counterparties with which the Master Fund would otherwise engage for its currency forward transactions.

  The following table is an allocation by sector as a percentage of net unrealized profit and loss on open positions for the Fund as a whole taking into account the positions at the underlying Master Fund level and the allocation to each underlying Master Fund as of March 31, 2016:  
     
    March 31, 2016    

The Fund experienced a net trading profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016 of $6,107,121.  
     
  Returns were varied over the quarter with positive returns in January and February, while March gave back some earlier gains.  
     
  References herein to the Fund s trading and portfolio refer to such trading and portfolios through the Master Funds generally.  
     
  The start of the quarter was characterized by an overall risk-off sentiment as the Chinese equity market experienced extreme volatility with heavy sell-offs that hit the circuit breakers twice in a week, coupled with the continued decline in the energy market.  Consequently, this led to raised uncertainty about policy actions from the central banks that remained throughout the quarter.  Mid-quarter, the outlook for 2016 became even more complicated as markets also dealt with the   
     
 23   

Table of Contents   
     
  marginal effect of negative rate policy in the Eurozone and Japan. However, Yellen s speech at the end of March maintained the dovish tone held throughout the quarter, leading the market to revise down the probability of a June rate hike. The portfolio however maintained a positive net-of-fees result year-to-date, despite the backdrop of uncertainty from central bank action.  
     
  The main contributor to performance at the start of the quarter was the fixed income sector, receiving positions across the developed market rates benefited from the January rally, especially during the final week of the month. Fixed income remained the main contributor to performance through February. However, this sector performed negatively towards the end of the quarter.  The majority of the losses came from long positions in developed market bonds such as UK Gilts despite being offset by long positions in Italian and French government bonds.  
     
  The commodities sector performed positively in January.  The short position in crude benefited early in the month as the price of oil slid below the $30/bbl mark. However, towards the middle of the quarter, while precious metals detracted from performance, gains were led by shorts in energy and agriculturals making the commodities sector the second best performing asset class in February.  Commodities was the worst performer in March despite most programs scaling back their shorts in the energy sector towards the end of the quarter.  
     
  The equities sector was the only sector that detracted at the start of the quarter as a result of the market sell-off, and remained down until the end of the quarter. Longs in the U.S. and Japanese major equity indices all suffered from the price drop during the first two weeks of January, and long positions in S P500 and DAX detracted in February.  In March, the Fund saw positive performance with gains led by longs in the US equity market including S P500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones.  
     
  Foreign currencies future and forwards contributed positively at the start of the quarter, but turned negative by the end. Short positions in GBP, CAD and ZAR against USD contributed to performance in the beginning of January.  However, a long JPY against USD position was maintained into February and through March as at the end of the quarter the euro and pound strengthened against the U.S. dollar, further detracting from performance.  
     
  In terms of positioning at quarter end, the portfolio continued to hold its long delta exposure although there were some notable reductions within the fixed income sector. The portfolio trimmed some of the longs in precious metals in the last week of the quarter and adjusted its overall delta exposure in commodities to almost flat. Regarding equities, the portfolio entered March flat, but swiftly built up a long exposure most significantly in the U.S. as the equities market rallied. Finally, the portfolio notably reversed its net long dollar exposure to net short during the second half of March in the FX sector.  
     
   April 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016   
     
  The following table is an allocation by sector as a percentage of net unrealized profit and loss on open positions for the Fund as a whole taking into account the positions at the underlying Master Fund level and the allocation to each underlying Master Fund as of June 30, 2016:

    June 30, 2016    

The Fund experienced a net trading profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 of $664,987.  
     
  Returns were negative at the start and through mid-quarter, but rebounded at quarter end to post positive returns.  
     
  References herein to the Fund s trading and portfolio refer to such trading and portfolios through the Master Funds generally.  
     
  The quarter started with  economic and financial market conditions being generally firmer, characterized by a further rebound in global stock markets and the commodities sector. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) acknowledged these improving trends, and expectations of a near term Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hike were substantially upgraded in May following the release of the April FOMC minutes.  Come June, however, attention shifted.  A disappointing non-farm payroll report which led to a decline in the US dollar and a rally in bonds across regions was overshadowed later in the month by the referendum on Britain voting to leave the EU. 
     
  The fixed income sector detracted substantially in April due to the broad sell-off towards month end, but  performed well in May given most programs  long positioning in bonds.  Long bond positions across the US and Europe led the gains in June. The fixed income sector was the best performing asset class throughout the quarter end and contributed most notably post Brexit in the final week of June. 
     
  The  FX sector contributed positively to performance at the start of the quarter, but was the main detractor in May with a meaningful net short position in the dollar.  Overall, USD net exposure in FX was aggressively reversed to long mid-quarter.  In June, the FX sector was the second best performer, benefiting from the currency moves post Brexit. 
     
 25   

Table of Contents   
     
  Commodities  detracted from performance with energy, grains, softs and industrial metals performing negatively, although precious metals and livestock mitigated the losses at the start of  the quarter. Mid-quarter, positive performance in longs in agricultural markets could not offset the losses from long positions in precious and industrial metals which suffered heavily.  However, this sector contributed positively at the end of the quarter. Precious metals and agriculturals were the top performers while the energy sector detracted. 
     
  Equities were mixed over the quarter.   The net long equity exposure performed positively through most of April, but could not hold on to the gains as equities market sold off in major developed markets at the end of the month. Despite positive performance in May, the equity sector detracted in June.  This was mainly due to losses related to the post Brexit referendum selloff as the portfolio held a bullish bias to this asset class. 
     
  In terms of positioning, the portfolio continues to hold a net long bias in fixed income and has increased risk towards quarter end. The increase is mainly driven by topping up long positions in the US bond market. Regarding the FX sector, the portfolio started June net long in USD, but reversed to flat by month end. This was primarily driven by a combination of increasing longs in JPY and reducing shorts in GBP and EUR against USD. In commodities, the portfolio maintained a net long exposure overall and increased its long bias to precious metals and agriculturals. Although the portfolio remained net long equities through June, net exposure has come down due to significant reduction in long US equity futures positions, along with a reversal in positioning in European equities from long to short.  
     
   July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016

  The Fund experienced a net trading loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 of $4,168,157.  
     
  Returns were positive in July, but detracted from end of July through to quarter end.  
     
  References herein to the Fund s trading and portfolio refer to such trading and portfolios through the Master Funds generally.  
     
  The start of the quarter was volatile for currencies, fixed income and commodities.  USD was up with a strong July payrolls report and higher retail sales mid-month, but reversed at the end of July, as the Federal Open Market Committee expressed that  near term risks to the economic outlook have diminished  and the Bank of Japan held rates and marginally increased their ETF purchase program. UK rates continued their post-Brexit march lower, and global bond curves flattened. Mid-quarter was relatively directionless for markets overall as the positive impact of additional QE measures was offset by increased inflation fears. The cumulative impact on markets, in terms of news flow, was relatively muted at quarter end, with central bank activity, fundamental data out of the US, an informal OPEC meeting, the US elections and concerns about the solvency of Deutsche Bank being relevant market drivers at one point or another.  
     
  The equity sector was the best performing asset class throughout July and exposure was increased. As a result, managers were net long broadly heading into mid-quarter, and gains were partially offset by poor performance in certain regions like Japan. At quarter end, managers accumulated losses against markets which exhibited a fair amount of choppiness.  
     
  In fixed income, the sector contributed at the start of the quarter, particularly as rates rallied through the final week of July.  Mid-quarter experienced losses that continued through quarter end.  
     
  Performance in July was mixed and slightly negative overall in the FX sector at the start of the quarter, although FX remained the highest risk allocation in the portfolio. As the US dollar rallied broadly against managers bearish positions, FX ended in negative territory mid-quarter. However, managers ended the month with gains despite carrying a net long US dollar bias against a broad move down in the greenback.  
     
  At the start of the quarter, the commodities sector was overall positive, with noteworthy positive contribution from energies and precious metals and losses from agriculturals. However, mid quarter the biggest drivers of negative performance were energies and precious metals. Energies also explain the bulk of losses in the commodity sector at quarter end.  
     
  In terms of positioning, managers continue to hold a net long bias to equites and fixed income. In FX, managers are roughly neutral to the US dollar overall. In commodities, the primary drivers of risk by subsector are precious metals. Net exposure in energy keeps on shifting back and forth on continued market choppiness and with programs having moved (again) from net short to flat by quarter end.

  The following table is an allocation by sector as a percentage of net unrealized profits and losses on open positions for the Fund as a whole taking into account the positions at the underlying Portfolio Fund level and the allocation to each underlying Portfolio Fund as of March 31, 2015:  
     
    March 31, 2015    

The Fund experienced a net trading profit for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015 of $15,122,621.  
     
  In the first quarter, returns were positive in January and March, with a slight dip in February. Continuing trends in fixed income, equity indices, currencies and energies drove performance.  
     
  Reference herein to the Fund s trading and portfolio refer to such trading conducted, and portfolios held, through the Fund s underlying Portfolio Funds.  Reference herein to the trading and portfolio of the Portfolio Funds refers to such trading and portfolios generally.  
     
  In equity indices, the Portfolio Funds came into the first quarter with long exposure, with positions across geographies. The largest exposures were in U.S. indices, based on recent trends. Equity markets saw some divergence in the first three months of the year. U.S. markets had roughly flat returns, taking a break from the strong performance they had put in the previous two years as rate hikes approached, a strong U.S. dollar began to weigh on earnings, and the energy sector continued to struggle. On the other hand, European markets took off strongly as quantitative easing became a reality and a weaker currency buoyed earnings. Japanese equities also performed well due to similar reasons. The Portfolio Funds generally adjusted their portfolios, reducing allocations to U.S. indices and increasing their long positions in Europe and Asia. The asset class finished the first quarter with gains, driven primarily by rising equity prices in non-U.S. markets.

Table of Contents   
     
  Fixed income was also profitable. The falling yields drove performance in 2014. The Portfolio Funds were long fixed income markets across geographies and maturities at the start of 2015, even as yields were low in many areas. Yields fell further, with big moves registered in January, especially in Europe. These moves were in part due to the concerns over slow growth and deflation, and the easing bias adopted by many central banks as evidenced by rate cuts in several countries and the quantitative easing decision from the European Central Bank. Yields did come back up some in February, but were down again in March. Overall, the direction was downward and the moves benefited long positions, resulting in profits for trend followers.  
     
  Currencies were another profitable asset class. Following some big moves in the second half of 2014, the Portfolio Funds were broadly long the U.S. Dollar against most major foreign currencies, with especially large short exposure in the euro. The first quarter generally saw a continuation of the strong dollar trend. Continuing divergence across economies and monetary policy versus the U.S. led to the euro being down in the first quarter and many foreign currencies fell in tandem. These moves led to gains.  
     
  In commodities, there was a short bias across portfolios. Energy positions had been profitable in the latter part of 2014 as oil and related markets fell precipitously due to acute supply and demand imbalances. The moves in oil continued in January, but there was a choppy period in February when oil markets rebounded strongly, followed by another down leg in March. WTI crude oil was down over the first quarter and short positions made additional gains. In metals and agricultural markets, price moves were more mixed and there were some losses due to choppiness and an absence of strong trends. Sugar and nickel were two trending markets where the Portfolio Funds did make some money. Looking at the asset class as a whole, commodities attribution was roughly flat.  
     
  Overall, even as some trends have looked a little extended, market moves generally continued in the direction of existing trends during the first quarter. There were gains in fixed income, equity indices and FX. Commodities were close to flat. As a result, the first quarter was profitable for the Fund.  
     
   April 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015   
     
  The following table is an allocation by sector as a percentage of net unrealized profits and losses on open positions for the Fund as a whole taking into account the positions at the Underlying Fund level and the allocation to each Underlying Fund as of June 30, 2015:

    June 30, 2015    

The Fund experienced a net trading loss for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 of $22,497,075.  
     
  Returns were negative for each month of the second quarter, culminating in a challenging June for many Trading Advisors.  
     
  Reference herein to the Fund s trading refer to such trading conducted, and portfolios held, through the Master Funds generally (provided that references with respect to April 2015 refer to the Fund s trading conducted, and portfolios held, through the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds generally).  
     
  The second quarter started off with reversals across asset classes and markets. With many trends appearing extended and mature coming into April, many sectors and markets reversed around at the same time. Markets were relatively quiet during May, with mixed performance in equities, slight weakness in fixed income and a rebound in the U.S. dollar against most major currencies.  Greece dominated the headlines in Europe, as markets speculated about the country s ability to repay an IMF loan due in early June.  The uncertainty caused European equity markets, the euro, and European fixed income to finish May lower. Volatility towards the end of the second quarter due to low levels of liquidity, uncertainty over the outcome of the Greek referendum and the sharp reversal in the Chinese equity markets proved a difficult environment for many trend following managers.  
     
  Equities were mixed during the second quarter. In April equity indices were profitable for the Fund. Long exposures in the U.S. and Asia helped the asset class. May was mixed; however, Japanese exposure benefited the Fund. Equities were a meaningful detractor during June with long positions across all regions adding to the negative results.  
     
  Fixed income detracted from performance during the second quarter. Yields reversed in April and began to rise from the low levels they had reached in March. Poor growth numbers in the United States, the possibility that rate hikes might be delayed and better economic performance in Europe all contributed to negative performance. Poor performance continued in May as long exposure in German bunds, U.S. treasuries and Japanese government bonds generated losses.

Table of Contents   
     
  Fixed income was a minor detractor during June with gains in U.S. bonds, French Obligations Assimilables du Tr sor, Italian Buoni del Tesoro Poliennalis and German bunds not being sufficient to fully offset losses in Japanese government bonds and British gilts.  
     
  In currencies, the U.S. dollar experienced a big reversal to start the second quarter, falling against several foreign currencies. Short positions in the Euro and Japanese yen were the worst hit. However, currencies were a leading contributor during May as the U.S. dollar reversed and benefited trend following managers. This was most noticeable against the Euro and Japanese yen. Currencies ended the quarter negative with Japanese yen and Euro shorts accounting for significant losses during June.  
     
  In commodities, a weaker U.S. Dollar coupled with an improving growth outlook in Europe led to higher energy prices. Short positions suffered losses as a result during April. Some other sectors such as industrial metals and softs also experienced reversals from the prevailing trend and added to losses. Shorts in softs and energies were a major detractor during June.  
     
  In terms of positioning, overall risk levels were reduced during the end of the second quarter. In commodities, the Trading Advisors remain broadly short most subsectors. Equities positions have been cut on the back of the losses and the level of exposure has come down relative to the end of May. Exposure to foreign exchange has increased slightly with long British pound and short Euro and short Japanese yen being the main areas of risk concentration. Long fixed income positioning continues to edge towards the lower end of the range.  
     
   July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015   
     
  The following table is an allocation by sector as a percentage of net unrealized profits and losses on open positions for the Fund as a whole taking into account the positions at the Underlying Fund level and the allocation to each Underlying Fund as of September 30, 2015:  
     
    September 30, 2015    

The Fund experienced a net trading loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015 of $484,440.  
     
 31   

Table of Contents   
     
  Reference herein to the Fund s trading and portfolio refer to such trading, and portfolios held, through the Master Funds generally.  
     
  The third quarter began with a relatively clear narrative; trouble for commodities and emerging markets while developed markets had a smoother ride as concerns eased over Greece. Commodities were at the forefront of market volatility in July due to weakening Chinese economic growth and inventory surplus in several markets. Against this backdrop the Fund had a positive July, recouping some losses incurred in prior months. By asset class, commodities were the strongest contributor to performance led by short positions in energy and precious metals. These gains were partially offset by long positions in agricultural markets which detracted due to the reversal in grain prices during the second half of July. Currencies also contributed to performance driven by short positions in both Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. Fixed income ended July with little contribution to portfolio performance. The choppy price action in U.S. treasuries caused some losses, but these were offset by long positions in European instruments. Within equity trading, long positions in China were a negative contributor, however, this was partially offset by long exposure in North America.  
     
  Stepping into August, volatility in equity markets returned in full force. This hurt trend-following Trading Advisors who were whipsawed in the range-bound market environment. Given the nature of the market moves, with heightened volatility and sharp reversals, the Fund had a tough month in August. Equities were the main detractor specifically in long equity indices in the U.S., Europe and Japan. FX also detracted considerably in August.  The long U.S. dollar theme prevalent in most portfolios only worked against emerging markets and commodity currencies but suffered against shorts in Japanese yen and Euro. Commodities were flat for August. Most Trading Advisors made small gains from shorts in base metals; though this was partially offset by shorts in gold and energies which rallied during the last week of August. Trading programs with slower signals performed worse when the markets rebounded. Fixed income was negative in August 2015. Long positions in U.S. treasuries and German bunds reversed earlier gains as the markets whipsawed towards the end of September.  
     
   The Fund was well positioned in September, ending with positive performance. The Federal Reserve retained its low interest rate regime by keeping the Federal Funds rate target range at 0% to 0.25%. The Federal Open Market Committee action was seen as confirmation of the extent of global growth concern that started in China and  emerging markets  economies and is far-reaching. This had an adverse effect on risk assets. Markets remained volatile in September with an overarching theme being the repricing down of growth expectations across asset classes. The fixed income sector was a leading contributor to performance over the course of September 2015. The Trading Advisors have positioned the Fund long in both government bonds and short-term interest rates. Commodities also performed well in September. The largest contributor was energy short, predominately driven by shorting crude oil. Shorts in livestock also added to performance. The main detractor in commodities for September was in agricultural grains and in softs as crops rebounded during the month. The Fund remains short in commodities. The equities sector was another main detractor in September. Losses were focused in longs in Japan and U.S. equity index futures. FX also detracted in September through losses in Euro and Japanese yen shorts.

  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
     
   Introduction   
     
  The FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds are speculative commodity pools. The market sensitive instruments held by the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds are acquired for speculative trading purposes and all or substantially all of the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  assets are subject to the risk of trading loss.  Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Underlying Funds  main line of business.  
     
  Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  open positions and, consequently, in their earnings and cash flows. The FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which they trade.  
     
  The FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds, under the direction of their respective Trading Advisors rapidly acquire and liquidate both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets.  Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a possible future market scenario will affect performance and the Fund s and the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.  
     
  Value at Risk ( VaR ) is a measure of the maximum amount which the Fund and the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Fund s and the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Fund, the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated VaR or the Fund s and the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  experience to date (i.e.,  risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Fund s and the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  losses in any market sector will be limited to VaR or by the Fund s and the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  attempts to manage market risk.  
     
   Quantifying the Fund s Trading Value at Risk   
     
   Quantitative Forward Looking Statements   
     
  The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures contain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 ( Securities Act ) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Securities Exchange Act ). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact.  
     
  The Fund s risk exposure in the various market sectors traded by the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds is quantified below in terms of VaR. Due to the Underlying   
     
 33   

Table of Contents   
     
  Funds  fair value accounting, any loss in the fair value of the Underlying Funds  open positions is directly reflected in the Underlying Funds  earnings (realized or unrealized) and cash flow (at least in the case of exchange-traded contracts in which profits and losses on open positions are settled daily through variation margin).  
     
  Prior to May 1, 2015, exchange maintenance margin requirements have been used by the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds as the measure of their VaR.  Maintenance margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum loss in the fair value of any given contract incurred in 95% to 99% of the one-day time periods included in the historical sample (approximately one year, generally) researched for purposes of establishing margin levels.  The maintenance margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation.  In the case of market sensitive instruments which are not exchange-traded (almost exclusively currencies in the case of the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds), the margin requirements for the equivalent futures positions have been used as VaR.  In those rare cases in which a futures-equivalent margin is not available, dealers  margins have been used.  During the period prior to May 1, 2015, 100% positive correlation in the different positions held in each market risk category has been assumed.  Consequently, the margin requirements applicable to the open contracts have been aggregated to determine each trading category s aggregate VaR.  The diversification effects (which would reduce the VaR estimates) resulting from the fact that the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds  positions were rarely, if ever, 100% positively correlated, were not reflected during this time period.  
     
  On and after May 1, 2015, VaR was calculated for each Underlying Fund by first calculating VaR with respect to each Master Fund and adjusting based on the Underlying Fund s pro-rata ownership of the Master Fund.  VaR of the Master Funds is based on a one day 99% Monte Carlo model VaR utilizing 1,000 simulations.  The sector breakdown of VaR for each Master Fund is based on an incremental VaR calculated for each position that is aggregated across each of the sectors presented below.  
     
  There are various ways of calculating VaR, and each methodology will not yield the same result.  Differences between VaR methodologies could be material as the underlying assumptions will vary.  
     
   The Underlying Funds  Trading Value at Risk in Different Market Sectors   
     
  The following information with respect to VaR is set forth in respect of the Underlying Funds separately, rather than for the Fund.  
     
   The following tables indicate the average, highest, and lowest trading  VaR associated with the FuturesAccess Portfolio Funds and the Underlying Funds  open positions by market category for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. (For initial Underlying Fund investments made during the period, VaR is calculated starting from the commencement of the holding.)

   Material Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk   
     
  The face value of the market sector instruments held by the Fund and the Underlying Funds are typically many times the applicable maintenance margin requirement (maintenance margin requirements generally ranging between approximately 1% and 10% of contract face value) as well as many times the capitalization of the Fund and the Underlying Funds.  The magnitude of the Fund s and the Underlying Funds  open positions creates a  risk of ruin  not typically found in most other investment vehicles.  Because of the size of their positions, certain market conditions   unusual, but historically recurring from time to time   could cause the Fund and the Underlying Funds to incur severe losses over a short period of time.  The foregoing VaR  
     
 40   

Table of Contents   
     
  table   as well as the past performance of the Fund and the Underlying Funds   gives no indication of this  risk of ruin.   
     
   Non-Trading Risk   
     
  The Underlying Funds have non-trading market risk on foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances (as well as the market risk they represent) are generally immaterial.  
     
  These Underlying Funds also have non-trading market risk on their assets which are held in cash at the clearing broker. The value of this cash is not interest rate sensitive, but there is cash flow risk in that if interest rates decline so will the cash flow generated on these monies.  
     
   Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures   
     
  The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund s market risk exposures through the Underlying Funds after the change in structure   except for (i) those disclosures that are statements of historical fact and (ii) the descriptions of how the Fund manages its primary market risk exposures   constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act. The Fund s primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by FRM and the Trading Advisors of the Underlying Funds for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results of the risk controls for the Fund and for the trading conducted through Underlying Funds to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund s risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of the value of their investment in the Fund.  
     
   Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure   
     
  Each Underlying Fund (inclusive of its related Master Fund) and its Trading Advisor are monitored by FRM s investment team.  This coverage is intended to ensure that each Underlying Fund and its Trading Advisor are monitored by individuals who have an in-depth understanding of the Underlying Fund and its Trading Advisor, as well as knowledge of the market environment affecting that particular strategy.
