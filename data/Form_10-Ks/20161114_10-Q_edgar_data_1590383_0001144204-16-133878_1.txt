Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Going
Concern  

   Nature of Operations   -BioHiTech
Global, Inc. (the  Company  or  BioHiTech ) through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, BioHiTech America, LLC,
BioHiTech Europe Limited and Entsorga North America, LLC, (collectively  subsidiaries ) offers its customers cost-effective
and technologically innovative advancements integrating technological, biological and mechanical engineering solutions for the
control, reduction and / or reuse of organic waste. 

Basis of Presentation   - The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). All
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

On January 20, 2016 the Company formed
a wholly owned subsidiary, Entsorga North America, LLC ( ENA ). On February 29, 2016, through an amended limited liability
agreement, ENA became a 31% equity owner of Apple Valley Waste Conversions, LLC ( AVWC ); an entity which has not previously
had any business activities and was also 20.9% owned by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, which combined represent a
51.9% controlling interest in ENA. Additionally, effective March 1, 2016, Entsorgafin, S.p.A, an Italian company with intellectual
property rights related to large scale mechanical biological treatment ( MBT ) of municipal or regional waste, granted
rights to the MBT intellectual property to AVWC for distribution 11 north and mid-Atlantic eastern states. Entsorgafin through
a subsidiary, owns 6.2% of AVWC. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information. Certain information or footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. Accordingly,
they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows. It is management s opinion, however, that the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2015, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and are
included within the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
on March 29, 2016. The financial information as of December 31, 2015 presented herein is derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements presented in the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2015. The interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future interim periods. 

Reclassifications to certain prior period
amounts have been made to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on previously reported
net loss. 

Going Concern -   For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a net loss of $4,970,741 and $5,001,452,
respectively, incurred a consolidated loss from operations of $4,416,942 and $4,545,646, respectively and used net cash in consolidated
operating activities of $3,657,747 and $3,170,427, respectively. At September 30, 2016, consolidated stockholders  deficit
amounted to $9,901,094 and the Company had a consolidated working capital deficit of $5,237,056. The Company does not yet have
a history of financial stability. Historically, the principal source of liquidity has been the issuance of debt and equity securities.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on management's
plans, which include further implementation of its business plan and continuing to raise funds through debt and/or equity raises.

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 September 30, 2016 and 2015,
and the three and nine months then ended (UNAUDITED) 

The Company is presently in the process
of raising additional non-registered convertible debt and capital for general operations, as well as for investment in several
strategic initiatives. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient debt or capital to sustain operations
or to pursue other strategic initiatives. 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

   Use of Estimates   - The preparation
of consolidated financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for items and matters including, but not limited to, allowance for uncollectible
accounts receivable, slow moving and excess inventory, asset valuations, including goodwill and intangibles, and useful lives,
employee benefits, taxes and other provisions and contingencies. 

Product and Services Revenue Recognition  
- The Company recognizes revenue for the majority of its products sold upon transfer of title and the passage of the risk of ownership,
which is generally upon shipment to the customer. Revenue from services, including environmental consulting, is recognized as services
are performed. 

Lease Revenue Recognition  
- The Company recognizes revenue from the rental of the Company s Eco-Safe Digester units ratably on a monthly basis over
the term of the lease, as it has determined that the rental agreements entered into in connection with its Eco Safe Digester units
qualify as operating leases, for which the Company is the operating lessor. 

Deferred Financing Costs -  
Financing costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets
or in non-current assets prior to the issuance of such debt. Deferred financing costs relating to issued debt are included as
a reduction to the applicable debt and amortized as interest expense over the term of the related debt instruments. 

Financial Instruments, Convertible
Instruments, Warrants and Derivatives -   The Company reviews its convertible instruments for the existence of embedded conversion
features which may require bifurcation. If certain criteria are met, the bifurcated derivative financial instrument is required
to be recorded at fair value and adjusted to market at each reporting period end date. The Company also reviews and re-assesses,
at each reporting date, any common stock purchase warrants and other freestanding derivative financial instruments and classifies
them on the consolidated balance sheet as equity, assets or liabilities based upon the nature of the instruments. 

Comprehensive Income (Loss) -  
Comprehensive income (loss) for the Company consists of net earnings (loss) and foreign currency translation. 

Income Taxes -   Deferred income
taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities given provisions of enacted laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the
asset or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax regulations of the jurisdictions
in which it operates, estimates the future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations, operating
results or the ability to implement tax planning and strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets
and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the  more than
likely  criteria. 

The Company recognizes the financial statement
benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position
following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements
is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant
tax authority. 

For the nine and three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company s effective rate, before valuations, was 36.7% and would have resulted in net deferred tax assets for
federal and state tax purposes arising primarily from net operating losses; A full valuation allowance due to the level of uncertainty
relative to the realization of the deferred tax assets has been provided resulting in an effective tax rate of 0.0%.

Income Taxes - Pro Forma C Corporation
Presentation -   As a result of the Swift Start Reverse Merger (Note 3), the Company s results of operations are taxed
as a C Corporation. Prior to the merger, the Company s operations were taxed as a limited liability company, whereby the
Company elected to be taxed as a partnership and income or loss was required to be reported by each respective member on their
separate income tax returns. Therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying financial statements
for periods prior to August 6, 2015. 

Stock-Based Compensation -  
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation - Stock Compensation. 
ASC 718 requires generally that all equity awards be accounted for at their  fair value.  This fair value is measured
on the grant date for stock-settled awards. Fair value is equal to the underlying value of the stock for  full-value 
awards such as restricted stock and performance shares, and is estimated using an option-pricing model with traditional inputs
for  appreciation  awards such as stock options and stock appreciation rights. 

Costs equal to these fair values are recognized
as expense ratably over the requisite service period based on the number of awards that are expected to vest, or in the period
of grant for awards that vest immediately and have no future service condition. For awards that vest over time, cumulative adjustments
in later periods are recorded to the extent actual forfeitures differ from the Company s initial estimates; previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed if the service or performance conditions are not satisfied and the award is forfeited. The expense
resulting from share-based payments is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations based upon the classification
of the underlying employees with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital. 

Subsequent modifications to outstanding
awards result in incremental cost if the fair value is increased as a result of the modification. Thus, a value-for-value stock
option repricing or exchange of awards in conjunction with an equity restructuring does not result in additional compensation cost. 

Note 3. Acquisitions and Disposals  

   Swift Start Reverse Merger -  
On August 6, 2015, the Company (formerly known as Swift Start Corp.) executed an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization
with BioHiTech America, LLC ( BHTA ) and BioHiTech Global, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Acquisition ),
pursuant to which Acquisition merged with and into BHTA in a reverse merger (the  Merger ), with BHTA surviving as
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As consideration for the Merger, the Company issued the interest holders of BHTA an aggregate
of 6,975,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Common Stock ), in accordance with their
pro rata ownership of BHTA s membership interests. In connection with the Merger, the Company s interest holders retired
and canceled an aggregate of 8,515,000 shares of its common stock. Following the consummation of the Merger, the issuance of the
6,975,000 shares of common stock to BHTA s interest holders and the retirement of the 8,515,000 shares of common stock, the
Company had 7,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, with the former BHTA interest holders beneficially owning
approximately 93% of such issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The Company also amended its Certificate of Incorporation
to (i) change its name to BioHiTech Global, Inc. and (ii) to amend the number of its authorized shares of capital stock from 200,000,000
to 30,000,000 shares, of which 20,000,000 shares were designated common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and 10,000,000 shares
were designated  blank check  preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. 

The Merger was accounted for as a reverse
business combination. Under this method of accounting, the Company was treated as the acquiring company for financial reporting
purposes. The net liabilities of Swift Start are stated at fair value, while the assets and liabilities of the Company are recognized
at their historical basis. Pursuant to the reverse business combination, the Company has restated its consolidated statements of
stockholders  deficiency on a recapitalization basis, so that all accounts are now presented as if the reverse business combination
had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The operating results for Swift Start are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the effective date of the reverse business combination of August 6, 2015 and have not have a material
impact on the financial statements. The $10,500 of net assets and fair value of Swift Start were immaterial as of the merger and
in addition to recognizing $18 of cash acquired, $10,482 was initially recognized as goodwill based upon historical stock acquisition
prices of Swift Start. As part of management s evaluation of goodwill as of December 31, 2015, it was determined that the
goodwill did not have a continuing value to the Company and it was written off as an impairment charge. Supplemental pro forma
information has not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was deminimus to the Company s consolidated financial
results.

Note 11. Line of Credit, Notes Payable,
Advance, Promissory Note, Convertible Promissory Notes and Long Term Debt  

 Notes, lines, advances and long term debts
are comprised of the following: 

Line of Credit -   The Company
has a revolving line of credit with a bank which provides for aggregate borrowings of up to $2,500,000. The line of credit is due
on demand and bears interest at the prime rate plus 3% (4.0% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015), which is recorded as
a component of interest expense. The line of credit is secured by the Company's assets, is personally guaranteed by certain stockholders
of the Company and does not contain any financial covenants. The line of credit also provides for letters of credit aggregating
$250,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 there were no outstanding letters of credit. 

Notes Payable -   During the
year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into two unsecured promissory notes, which do not contain any financial covenants.
As of September 30, 2016, each of the notes have a remaining balance outstanding of $100,000 with interest at the rate of 10.0%
and maturite in July and September 2017, respectively. 

Series A Unsecured Subordinated Convertible
Promissory Notes     During 2016, the Company entered into a series of Securities Purchase Agreements (the  Purchase
Agreement ) with certain accredited investors (the  Investors ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell
and the Investors agreed to purchase in a private placement offering (the  Private Placement ) units (the  Units )
in the aggregate offering amount of $3,400,000, of which $2,250,000 was with related parties. 

Each Unit is comprised of a convertible
promissory note and warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. Each note bears interest at the rate of 8%
per annum and is due on the earlier of: (i) 24 months (February 10, 2018); (ii) the date the common stock is listed on The Nasdaq
stock market or NYSE MKT; or (iii) a  Change of Control  of the Company, which is defined as a liquidation, dissolution,
winding up, change in voting control or sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets. Each note sold is convertible
into shares of Common Stock equal to the outstanding principal amount under the note, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, divided
by a conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) equal to the lowest of: (i) the trading price on the date of the listing;
(ii) the price per share paid by investors in a subsequent underwritten public offering in connection with the listing; (iii) the
lowest price paid by investors in a subsequent offering of the Company s securities; (iv) the per share price in a change
of control transaction; or (v) $3.75 per share. Prior to maturity, an investor may elect, at its option and in its sole discretion,
to convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount under the note, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, into shares
of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $3.75 per share. 

The warrants are exercisable for a period
of five years into shares of common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock into which the notes are convertible at
an exercise price equal to 120% of the conversion price of the notes. 

The embedded conversion feature and warrants
issued in the transaction are not indexed to the Company s common stock. However, the embedded conversion feature and warrants
did not meet the definition of a derivative and therefore such conversion feature was not bifurcated from the underlying note payable
and the warrants were not recorded as a derivative liability. 

As of September 30, 2016, the balance of
the outstanding notes amounted to $3,400,000 and is presented net of unamortized deferred offering costs of $110,154, resulting
from deferred offering costs of $165,230 less $55,076 of accumulated amortization. These costs are being amortized as a component
of interest expenses over the original 24-month terms of the notes, unless there is an early maturity. Interest expense on the
notes is due at the maturity of the notes and has been presented as a non-current liability.

Series V Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note  
  During 2016, the Company entered into a series of convertible promissory notes. Each note bears interest at the rate of
8% per annum and is due on the earlier of: (i) 24 months (February 10, 2018); (ii) the date the common stock is listed on The Nasdaq
stock market or NYSE MKT; or (iii) a  Change of Control  of the Company, which is defined as a liquidation, dissolution,
winding up, change in voting control or sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets. Each note sold is convertible
into shares of Common Stock equal to the outstanding principal amount under the note, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, divided
by a conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) equal to the lowest of: (i) the trading price on the date of the listing;
(ii) the price per share paid by investors in a subsequent underwritten public offering in connection with the listing; (iii) the
lowest price paid by investors in a subsequent offering of the Registrant s securities; (iv) the per share price in a change
of control transaction; or (v) $3.75 per share. Prior to maturity, an investor may elect, at its option and in its sole discretion,
to convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount under the note, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, into shares
of common stock at a conversion price equal to $3.75 per share. 

Long term debt -   Represents
two loans collateralized by vehicles with interest ranging from 1.9% to 4.98%. Amortizing principal payment requirements as of
September 30, 2016 are as follow: 

Interest Expense -   All interest
on the Company s various debts are recognized as interest expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Note 12. Equity Transactions  

   Maxim Warrants -   In connection
with the issuance of the Units described in Note 11, the Company agreed to issue warrants to Maxim Group LLC, the placement agent,
that are exercisable into 10% of the total number of shares of common stock that the notes are convertible under the notes at an
exercise price of $3.75 per share. The warrants expire 5 years from the date of issuance of the underlying notes. 

The unsecured subordinated convertible
promissory notes contain conversion features that are required to be measured when the contingency is resolved. The terms of the
conversion feature in the notes, and hence the Maxim Warrants, do not permit the Company to compute the number of common shares
that the note holders will receive upon conversion. Accordingly, the Company must wait until the contingent event occurs to compute
the number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the warrants. 

Barksdale Warrants -   In connection
with an Offering of BHTA in October 2013 of Class B Common Interests BHTA agreed to issue Barksdale Global Holdings, LLC ( Barksdale )
warrants to purchase a number of Class B Common Interests of BHTA, as now converted into Common Stock of the Company. The warrants
were subsequently issued on June 30, 2015, whereby Barksdale was issued a warrant to purchase up to $140,000 of BHTA s Class
B Common Interests on or before the expiration date of June 30, 2020. The warrant is exercisable during the period commencing upon
the consummation of the Company s next successive equity raise in which the Company receives gross proceeds of a minimum
of $5.0 million ( Qualified Financing ). If the Company does not consummate a Qualified Financing prior to the expiration
date, the warrant shall never be exercisable. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Barksdale may not exercise the warrant within 12 months
of the consummation date of the Merger. 

The Company estimated the fair value of
the warrant on the measurement date to be $14,182 (or $10,744 per warrant) using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of 50.24%, (2) risk-free interest rate of 1.42% and (3) expected life of five years.
During 2015, as a result of the issuance of the warrants, the Company reclassified the warrant liability to stockholders 
deficit.

Other Warrants -   In connection
with prior debt offerings that have been converted into equity, warrants expiring between May and July of 2020 representing an
$80,000 purchase equity interest remain outstanding. The warrants allow the holders to acquire up to $80,000 of the Company s
common stock at a price of 120% of the closing price of the Company s first issuance of equity in one, or a series of related
transactions, through which the Company receives gross process of $5,000,000 or more from one or more financial institutions or
 accredited investors,  as defined by the Securities Act of 1933. Should the Company not consummate such an issuance
of equity by the expiration of the warrants, the warrants shall never be exercisable 

Strategic Consulting Agreement    
During 2016, the Company entered into a strategic consulting agreement with Tusk Ventures LLC for a twelve-month term, with a sixty-day
termination option by either party, at any time. In the event of a termination, fees are due through the last day of services following
the termination notice. The contract includes issuing convertible debt in the amount of $25,000 per month that is on substantially
the same terms as the Series A Unsecured Subordinated Convertible Promissory Notes. Following a mandatory conversion event, the
agreement provides for issuing Common Stock amounting to $25,000 per month based on a thirty-day trailing average price. 

Note 13. Equity Incentive Plans     

 During 2015, the Company established the
BioHiTech Global, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, which is available to eligible employees, directors, consultants and advisors
of the Company and its affiliates. The plan allows for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, reload
options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock representing up to 750,000 shares. The Plan is administered by the board
of directors. Effective March 1, 2016, the Company granted nonqualified options for 371,250 shares. Effective April 15, 2016, the
Company granted 347,500 restricted stock units. As of September 30, 2016, there were 31,250 shares available under the Plan for
future grants. 

Stock Options -   The fair
value of options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The valuation determined by the
Black-Scholes pricing model is affected by the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly
complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term
of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The risk free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
rate for the expected life at the time of grant, volatility is based on the average long-term implied volatilities of peer companies,
the expected life is based on the estimated average of the life of options using the simplified method, and forfeitures are estimated
on the date of grant based on certain historical data. The Company utilizes the simplified method to determine the expected life
of its options due to insufficient exercise activity during recent years as a basis from which to estimate future exercise patterns.
The expected dividend assumption is based on the Company s history and expectation of dividend payouts. 

Forfeitures are required to be estimated
at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. 

On March 1, 2016, the Company granted 371,250
stock options to employees and directors for future services. These options had a fair value of $520,210 using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: 

The options vest over four years. During
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compensation expense related to the stock options amounted to $34,790
and $209,655, respectively. 

The weighted-average grant date fair value
of options granted on March 1, 2016 was $520,210. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options at
September 30, 2016 amounts to $295,375 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years.

Restricted Stock Units    
On April 15, 2016, the Company granted 347,500 restricted stock units ( RSU ) to certain employees. 15,833 of the RSUs
vested immediately and the remaining units vest over a three-year period, subject to continued service on each applicable vesting
date. The RSUs have no voting or dividend rights. The fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant was $4.05 per share
based upon the quoted closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The aggregate grant date fair value
of the award amounts to $1,408,167 which will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. As of September 30,
2016, the aggregate intrinsic value of the unvested RSUs was $1,061,334. 

During the three months and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compensation expense related to the RSUs amounted to $126,895 and 302,663, respectively. 

Total unrecognized compensation expense
related to the unvested RSUs at September 30, 2016 amounts to $1,105,504 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of 2.5 years.

Statement of Cash Flows      In
August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). The update amends the guidance in Accounting
Standards Codification 230,  Statement of Cash Flows , and clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts
and cash payments on the  statement  of cash flows with the objective of reducing the
existing diversity in practice related to eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments in this update are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
-   In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts
with Customers - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  (Topic 606). The amendments clarify two aspects of ASU
No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  by providing (1) guidance for identifying performance obligations
and (2) licensing implementation guidance. Public business entities should apply the guidance similar to Update 2014-09 to annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Earlier application
is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within
that reporting period. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 provides guidance
for revenue recognition and affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or
enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,
 Revenue Recognition,  and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is the recognition of
revenue when a company transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve
this core principle and, in doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance.
These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include
in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09, as amended,
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition
methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option
to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09
recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). The Company does not anticipate that the adoption,
by means of a retrospective approach with a cumulative effect, if any, will have a material effect on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations. 

Stock Compensation -   In March
2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
(Topic 718). The amendments in this ASU is to significantly reduce the complexity and cost of accounting for excess tax benefits
and tax deficiencies related to employee share-based payment transactions, which include restricted stock and stock options. Also,
ASU No. 2016-09 requires an entity to run excess tax benefits and deficiencies through its income statement, which in effect eliminates
the concept of additional paid-in capital. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for financial
statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods.
The Company will evaluate the effects, if any, that adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial position or results
of operations. 

Leases -   In February 2016,
the FASB issued new lease accounting guidance (ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases).  Under the new guidance, at the commencement date,
lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from
a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to
use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of
12 months or less. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted
upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases)
must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition
accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective
transition approach. The Company will evaluate the effects, if any, that adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations. 

Inventory -   In July 2015,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ).
ASU 2015-11 requires inventory measured using any method other than last-in, first out ( LIFO ) or the retail inventory
method to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market. This
ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and their related interim periods. Early application
is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

Issuance of Additional Series V Subordinated
Convertible Promissory Notes     Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company issued an additional $50,000 in Series
V Subordinated Convertible Promissory Notes (Note 11) in connection with a strategic consulting agreement (Note 12). The Company

Company Overview   

Since inception the
Company has primarily focused on its on-going Eco-Safe Digester business. During 2016, the Company has commenced strategic initiatives
in the area of Mechanical Biological Treatment ( MBT ) facilities that process waste at the municipal or regional level
convert a significant portion of intake into an US EPA recognized alternative commodity fuel. 

Eco-Safe Digester Business   

BioHiTech provides
a simple, environmentally friendly, and cost effective solution for food waste disposal.  BioHiTech has a global distribution
license to sell, lease, use, distribute, and manufacture the product currently known as the Eco-Safe Digester. The Eco-Safe Digester
is a data-driven, network-based mechanical/biological technology which transforms food waste into nutrient-neutral water that can
safely be disposed of via conventional sanitary sewer systems.  The Eco-Safe Digester reduces greenhouse gas emissions by
reducing the volume of food waste being disposed of in landfills and eliminating the corresponding transportation of this waste.
In addition, the technology saves users money by avoiding disposal costs ( tip fees ) and transportation charges. 
This process allows waste producing organizations to actively contribute to environmental sustainability and the preservation of
resources in a cost-effective manner.  The Eco-Safe Digester may be used by businesses in food service, hospitality, healthcare,
government, conference centers, education centers, or stadiums that generate a high volume of waste. It is estimated that the US
addressable market is in excess of 250,000 locations that could qualify for digesters and an additional 250,000 internationally. 

The Eco-Safe Digester
is currently installed in 37 states throughout the United States as well as 15 foreign countries. 

BioHiTech has over
300 units installed worldwide with over eight years of operating experience. With units in the field for over eight years, BioHiTech s
products have proven to have at least a reasonably long-term life expectancy comparable to the products sold by its competitors. 

BioHiTech hopes to
leverage its existing technology, including the Eco-Safe Digester s on-board weighing system, by collecting, accumulating
and providing empirical data which we hope will improve the efficiency of the upstream supply chain. By streaming data from the
digesters, collecting information from system users and integrating business application data, we expect BioHiTech s internet
enabled system known as the BioHiTech Cloud TM  to provide necessary data that we expect will help customers reshape their
purchasing decisions and positively affect employee behavior. In its simplest form, the BioHiTech Cloud quantifies food waste in
a fashion that has historically not been available. It enables users to understand food waste generation habits and to pay for
the Eco-Safe Digester based on savings on to traditional waste charges as well as improved operational efficiencies. 

The BioHiTech Cloud
data is used to help educate customers as to where, when and how waste is being created. Tracking and analyzing waste based on
creation time, food type, preparation stage, origin of waste or other key metrics may provide a clear picture of the food waste
lifecycle. While the Eco-Safe Digester already provides significant economic savings and decreases in carbon footprint, the addition
of the BioHiTech Cloud increases that impact by helping the customer to more accurately manage inventory, preparation practices
and staff efficiencies. 

BioHiTech believes
that its combined offering of technology and its Eco-Safe Digester provide customers with information that has not been readily
available to consumers in the past that has the potential for improved management and reduction of waste at the point of generation
on a real-time basis. 

BioHiTech believes
its digester products remove organic waste from the overcrowded and costly landfills of the world and provide significant benefits
to both business organizations and the community including: 

Eliminating the transportation of organic waste, 

Reducing carbon emissions associated with landfilling
and truck transportation, 

Complying with municipal laws banning organic waste
from landfills, 

Contributing to corporate and regulatory targets for
diverting waste from landfills, 

Extending the lifespan of the country s disposal
facilities, 

Reducing groundwater and soil contamination at landfills, 

Reducing harmful greenhouse gases that contribute
to global climate change, and 

Recycling food waste into renewable resources (clean
water, biogas, bio-solids). 

The BioHiTech Cloud TM , Cirrus TM 
Mobile Application and Alto TM  Application   

The Company s
cloud-based dashboard, the BioHiTech Cloud gives real-time visibility to the status of the digester and provides insight to the
efficiencies of the operations of food preparation and consumption of the user. BioHiTech currently has a provisional patent pending
on this technology. 

Early in 2016, the
Company released its first mobile application called BioHiTech Cirrus . The new application should allow customers more immediate
access to analytical data provided by the Eco-Safe Digester and more efficient monitoring across a number of network connected
devices. The mobile application is available free to existing BioHiTech Cloud customers and is available through the iTunes Store,
as well as Google Play. 

During September 2016,
the Company released Alto TM , which is a key new component of BioHiTech's comprehensive food waste solution that uses
data and analytics to help drive smarter business decisions. The Alto software is designed to enhance the productivity of the Company's
Eco-Safe Digester by enabling easy to understand, real-time interactive communication to improve unit performance levels, processing
statistics, and maintenance routines via a secured internet connection on any standard computer or mobile device. In addition to
enhancing the productivity of its own equipment, the platform can easily be expanded to provide a whole new way for people to intelligently
communicate actionable information with any internet-enabled industrial equipment in order to achieve significant performance optimization. 

Mechanical Biological Treatment   

On January 20, 2016,
the Company formed Entsorga North America, LLC ( ENA ) as a wholly owned subsidiary. ENA owns a 31% interest in Apple
Valley Waste Conversions, LLC ( AVWC ). Frank E. Celli, the Company s CEO also owns a 20.9% interest in AVWC.
Mr. Celli intends to assign his voting rights to ENA so that, collectively, ENA would have voting control of over 51% of AVWC.
AVWC currently holds the exclusive license for the construction, operation, and/or sub-licensing of the technology known as High
Efficiency Biological Treatment ( HEBioT ), which is owned by Entsorgafin, S.p.A. an Italian company that provides
cost effective environmental technologies throughout the world. HEBioT is a proprietary form of Mechanical Biological Treatment
( MBT ) that is used widely throughout Europe. 

The HEBioT technology
converts mixed municipal and organic waste to a US Environmental Protection Agency (the  US EPA ) recognized alternative
fuel source. By utilizing a combination of mechanical and biological processes to accelerate the decomposition of the organic fraction
of waste, the end product produced, known as solid recovered fuel ( SRF ) has a carbon value equivalent to approximately
75-80% of traditional coal and can be used as a replacement and/or supplement to coal. After receipt and processing of waste at
the facility, approximately 80% of the incoming waste is reduced, recycled or converted into the approved alternative fuel, with
the remaining 20% of the incoming waste being disposed of via traditional methods. 

The US EPA has issued
a  comfort letter  stating that any fuel produced utilizing the HEBioT technology is deemed an engineered fuel and
can be marketed as a commodity. 

ENA, as the controlling
member of AVWC, will be charged with new project development throughout 11 northeast U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
This project development may consist of construction, ownership and operation of actual facilities or possible sub-licenses to
third parties to utilize the technology. ENA may realize revenue s in various ways: 

Construction
and operation of actual facilities, in which case ENA would identify an opportunity to develop a plant, facilitate its permitting
and construction and ultimately operate the facility. In this case ENA will realize all revenue and costs associated with the
development of the project and will pay to AVWC a license fee. 

     Charged
services to AVWC for projects that it brings to fruition where AVWC receives annual license fees. In this case, along with the
charged services, ENA would receive its pro-rata share of the license fees paid to AVWC. 

ENA will be responsible
for marketing the HEBioT technology in the 11 northeast U.S. states and the District of Columbia. 

The license agreement
between Entsorgafin (the technology owner) and AVWC is perpetual in nature, with certain performance standards during the initial
five years of the agreement. 

The Company believes
it will be successful in the development of the ENA plants under one of the two proposed revenue scenarios over the next 24 to
36 months. The deployment of this technology is consistent with the Company s vision of providing disruptive technologies
to the traditional waste industry. With the ability to accept up to 25% of each plant s capacity in the form of pure food
waste, the Company adds an option of municipal level solutions in the food waste industry that it does not currently possess. 

In addition, the Company
has the opportunity to acquire up to approximately a 40% interest in Entsorga West Virginia LLC ( EWV ) from the original
investors at the original purchase price of $60,000 for each 1% of interest in EWV. The EWV bond financing agreements provide that
any investor may sell or transfer membership interests to a third party at any time, so long as it does not trigger a change of
control. The investment by the Company, even if made in the maximum amount, would not trigger a change in control. In order to
secure financing for the facility, the EWV investors contributed approximately $6,000,000 in equity to the project. As a result
of an unforeseen change in business direction of one of the original investors, the other investors provided additional equity
as  bridge capital  to facilitate EMV's bond financing. 

EWV represents the
first deployment of the Entsorga HEBioT technology in the United States. Such deployment is currently underway in Martinsburg,
WV. EWV has its own intellectual property agreement with Entsorgafin S.p.A. which is not part of the agreement that AVWC has with
Entsorgafin S.p.A. The EWV plant has received its necessary permits and EWV has closed on its financing to construct the facility.
We anticipate the facility will be able to accept up to 110,000 tons per year of municipal solid waste delivered from the surrounding
areas. The facility will consist of a 54,000 square foot industrial building located on approximately 12 acres of leased property.
The facility will include a plant which will be equipped with HEBioT technology and will ultimately be able to produce approximately
50,000 tons per year of EPA recognized renewable fuel. 

EWV has entered into
a 30-year initial term land lease with a municipal authority for industrial property adjacent to its previously closed landfill
site. EWV has entered into numerous contracts, including: the engineering, procurement and commissioning of the plant; a 10 year
solid waste delivery agreement for the delivery of 70,000 tons per year of municipal solid waste to the plant; a 10 year contract
for the sale and delivery of SRF manufactured at the plant, and a 10 year professional services agreement that provides managerial
services for general plant oversight, certain logistical services, and financial administration. While EWV will be responsible
for its own costs of operations, plant oversight and administration will be performed under the agreement. 

EWV held its groundbreaking
ceremony in January 2016 and subsequently closed on the issuance of Tax Exempt Industrial Development Bonds issued by the West
Virginia Economic Development Authority in the amount of $25,000,000 (the  Bonds ). The facility is currently under
construction and is expected to begin commercial operations in the summer of 2017. 

This first operational
plant utilizing the patented HEBioT technology in the United States will serve as the company s  showplace  to
help expedite future deployments.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Use of Estimates  
- The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, requires the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates are used when
accounting for items and matters including, but not limited to, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, slow moving and
excess inventory, asset valuations, including goodwill and intangibles, and useful lives, employee benefits, taxes and other provisions
and contingencies. 

Product and
Services Revenue Recognition   - The Company recognizes revenue for the majority of its products sold upon transfer of title
and the passage of the risk of ownership, which is generally upon shipment to the customer. Revenue from services is recognized
as services are performed. 

The Company recognizes
revenue from multiple-element arrangements when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii)
the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability of the sale is reasonably assured. The Company s arrangements do
not contain general rights of return. 

Multiple-element arrangements
require the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. To qualify as a separate unit of
accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and revenue is allocated to each deliverable
in the arrangement based on the relative fair value of the respective deliverable. The Company s product sales and installation
services have standalone value as these products and services are sold separately by the Company, and the Company has established
 vendor specific objective evidence  ( VSOE ) of fair value for determining the fair value of each element. 

Lease Revenue
Recognition -   The Company recognizes revenue from the rental of the digester units ratably on a monthly basis over the
term of the lease, as it has determined that the rental agreements entered into in connection with its Eco Safe Digester units
qualify as operating leases, for which the Company is the operating lessor. In order to determine lease classification as operating,
the Company evaluates the terms of the rental agreement to determine if the lease includes any of the following provisions which
would indicate capital lease treatment: 

Transfer of ownership of the digester unit,   

Bargain purchase option at the end of the term of the lease,   

Lease term is greater than 75% of the economic life of the digester unit, or   

Present value of minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value of the digester unit at inception
of the lease.   

In addition, the Company
also considers the following: 

Collectability of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable, and,   

No important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by the
Company under the lease.   

Long-Lived Assets
-   The Company assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment,
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impaired asset
is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available. Estimated fair market value is generally
measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. 

Financial Instruments,
Convertible Instruments, Warrants and Derivatives -   The Company reviews its convertible instruments for the existence of
embedded conversion features which may require bifurcation, if certain criteria are met, the bifurcated derivative financial instrument
is required to be recorded at fair value and adjusted to market at each reporting period end date. The Company also reviews and
re-assesses, at each reporting date, any common stock purchase warrants and other freestanding derivative financial instruments
and classifies them on the consolidated balance sheet as equity, assets or liabilities based upon the nature of the instruments. 

Stock-Based
Compensation -   The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,  Compensation - Stock
Compensation.  ASC 718 requires generally that all equity awards be accounted for at their  fair value.  This
fair value is measured on the grant date for stock-settled awards. Fair value is equal to the underlying value of the stock for
 full-value  awards such as restricted stock and performance shares, and is estimated using an option-pricing model
with traditional inputs for  appreciation  awards such as stock options and stock appreciation rights. 

Costs equal to these
fair values are recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the number of awards that are expected to vest, or
in the period of grant for awards that vest immediately and have no future service condition. For awards that vest over time, cumulative
adjustments in later periods are recorded to the extent actual forfeitures differ from the Company s initial estimates: previously
recognized compensation cost is reversed if the service or performance conditions are not satisfied and the award is forfeited.
The expense resulting from share-based payments is recorded the accompanying consolidated statements of operations based upon the
functional classification of the individual grantees. 

Subsequent modifications
to outstanding awards result in incremental cost if the fair value is increased as a result of the modification. Thus, a value-for-value
stock option repricing or exchange of awards in conjunction with an equity restructuring does not result in additional compensation
cost. 

Income Taxes
-   Deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities given provisions of enacted laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based
on changes to the asset or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax regulations
of the jurisdictions in which it operates, estimates the future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations,
operating results or the ability to implement tax planning and strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax
assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the  more
than likely  criteria. 

The Company recognizes
the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than
not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized
in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement with the relevant tax authority.  

Results of Operations  

Prior to 2013, BioHiTech s
strategic focus had been directed to the sales and service of the Eco-Safe Digester. During 2013, BioHiTech started a process
of redirecting the business toward an expanded customer relationship based on recurring long term contracts in the form of leasing
and bundled services. BioHiTech also initiated the creation of a research and development group to explore and exploit how it
could incorporate  big data  and the  internet of things  to its environmental technology, converting
its units to network connected devices.  At that time, BioHiTech also commenced a process of assembling a broader team that
had the depth and skill set required to achieve disruptive change in the organic waste industry. As further discussed in Item
2   Company Overview, during 2016, the Company started strategic initiatives in the area of Mechanical Biological Treatment
( MBT ) facilities that process waste at the municipal or regional level converting a significant portion of intake
into an US EPA recognized alternative commodity fuel. As of September 30, 2016 and for nine months then ended, the initiatives
of the Company in the MBT area do not have a significant impact on its operations or financial position. 

Summary Results   

For the three months ended September, 2016
total revenue increased by 86% over the comparable 2015 period. This increase was driven by a 33% increase in rental, services
and parts and a 305% increase in equipment sales, which was driven by international and domestic reseller activity that continues
to be predominantly sales based. 

Gross margin improved from 16% overall
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 31% for the comparable 2016 period with improvements in both product and service
revenues. 

Operating expenses increased by 16% to
$1,611,986 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which reflect the higher level of personnel to support the Company s
strategic focus and to support its reporting and capital activities as a public entity. 

Revenue by Type   

The following table breaks down revenue
by type: 

Total revenue 
increased by $287,864, or 86%, from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30, 2016. Within
revenue, continuing on the strategy shift that started in 2013, the Company continued to promote rental, services and parts over
equipment sales with rental, service and parts increasing by 33% from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months
ended September 30, 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, rental, service and parts decreased to 58% of revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 81% for the same period in 2015, while equipment sales as a percentage of revenue
increased to 42% from 19%, respectively. This increase in equipment sales was primarily attributable to an increase in international
reseller activity in areas where the rental market is not as well recognized as the retail sales model. 

Rental, service
and parts revenue  increased by $88,256, or 33%, from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September
30, 2016. This increase is primarily driven by a greater number of rented units. 

Equipment
sales  increased by $199,608, or 305%, from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended
September 30, 2016. This increase was due to a 167% increase in unit sales that was comprised almost entirely of direct
retail sales. 

Cost of Revenue   

The following table breaks down cost of
revenue by type: 

Cost of revenue mainly
consists of the cost of acquiring digester units that are sold, depreciation expense on rental units, warehousing, installation,
maintenance, parts and shipping costs, as well as related salary and employee costs. Total costs of revenue increased by $151,085,
or 54%, from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to the change
in mix of revenue between equipment sales and rental, service and parts and improved margins in both lines of business. 

Rental, service
and parts costs of revenue  increased by $43,104, or 20% (as compared to a 33% increase in rental, service and parts revenue)
from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Labor related costs
decreased by $16,971 or 32% from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30, 2016, due to
redeploying staff and improving efficiencies in directing services. Contracted services increased by $17,677 or 56% from the three
months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30, 2016, due to the mix of geographic locations that are covered
by contracted services. Depreciation increased by $42,260 or 77% from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months
ended September 30, 2016, due to a prospective change in the future estimated economic lives for a pool of machines, an increase
in the cost of equipment leased, as well as the timing of when the equipment became leased. 

Equipment sales
cost of revenue  increased by $107,981 or 158% from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September
30, 2016 due to increased sales, which increased by 305% over the same period. 

Gross Profit   

The following table breaks down gross profit
by type:  

The following table breaks down gross margin
by type: 

Rental, service
and parts gross margin  Increased to 28.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to higher volumes of
covered equipment and by changes in the personnel and contracted services. 

Equipment sales
gross margin  increased from a negative 4.9%, which was due to non-contractual sales of equipment at the end of several leases
at prices less than cost during the three months ended September 30, 2015, to 33.4% during the three months ended September 30,
2016, which is reflective of the higher level of retail sales over reseller sales. 

Operating expenses   

The following table breaks down operating
expenses by type: 

Selling, general
and administrative expenses  increased by $280,878, or 40% from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months
ended September 30, 2016. The following table breaks down the major categories of selling, general and administrative expenses: 

Personnel related
expenses increased by $322,617 or 70% from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30, 2016.
This increase was driven by adding staff to drive the strategic repositioning of the Company and to support geographic expansion.
In addition, stock based compensation amounting to $119,490 was included during the three months ended September 30, 2016 (37%
of change in personnel) as compared to none in 2015. Other expenses decreased by $32,758 or 45% from the three months ended September
30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in refurbishment and freight
costs. 

Research and development
expenses  increased by $70,933, or 41% from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30,
2016. This increase was primarily driven increased personnel expenses, which included stock based compensation amounting to $42,217
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. There was no stock based compensation in 2015. 

Professional fees 
decreased by $93,373, or 21% from the three months ended September 30, 2015 to the three months ended September 30, 2016. The following
table breaks down the major categories of professional fees: 

Professional fees
expense decreased primarily due to a reduction in costs relating to the 2015 merger with Swift and the costs related to being a
public company actively involved in additional fund raising. During 2016, the Company engaged a strategic consulting firm that
is providing services related to both the digester and MBT business lines which increased professional fees by $152,660. 

Summary Results   

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 total revenue increased by 64% over the comparable 2015 period. This increase was driven by a 37% increase in rental, services
and parts (45% of the total increase in revenue) and a 294% increase in equipment sales (67% of the total increase in revenue),
which was driven by international and domestic reseller activity that continues to be predominantly sales based. Revenue in 2015
also includes revenues related to QTags, which was sold in 2015. Through September 30, 2016, QTags accounted for 8% of revenue
and a negative   13% of the change between the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Gross margin improved from 10% overall
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 with improvements in both product
and service revenues. 

Operating expenses increased by 66% to
$4,812,010 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which reflect the higher level of personnel to support the Company s
strategic focus and to support its reporting and capital activities as a public entity. 

Revenue by Type   

The following table breaks down revenue
by type: 

Total revenue 
increased by $598,979, or 64%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 Within
revenue, continuing on the strategy shift that started in 2013, the Company continued to promote rental, services and parts over
equipment sales with rental, service and parts increasing by 37% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. As a percentage of total revenue, rental, service and parts decreased to 65% of revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 77% for the same period in 2015, while equipment sales as a percentage of revenue
increased to 35% from 15%, respectively. This increase in equipment sales was primarily attributable to an increase in international
reseller activity in areas where the rental market is not as well recognized as the retail sales model. Other revenue in 2015 includes
revenues relating to the QTags business line that was sold in May 2015. Excluding the revenues relating to the sold business line
from 2015, the nine-month to nine-month increase in revenue would have been $673,959, or 78% 

Rental, service
and parts revenue  increased by $270,068 or 37%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September
30, 2016. This increase is primarily driven by a greater number of rented units. 

Equipment
sales  increased by $403,891, or 294%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September
30, 2016. This increase was due to a 113% increase in unit sales and a change in unit size mix toward larger machines. 

Other revenue 
decreased by $74,980 to $  , from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Other
revenue in 2015 was primarily comprised of revenues relating to the QTags business. 

Cost of Revenue   

The following table breaks down cost of
revenue by type: 

Cost of revenue mainly
consists of the cost of acquiring digester units that are sold, depreciation expense on rental units, warehousing, installation,
maintenance, parts and shipping costs, as well as related salary and employee costs. Total costs of revenue (excluding QTags) increased
by $328,509, or 40%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to
the change in mix of revenue between equipment sales and rental, service and parts and improved margins. 

Rental, service
and parts costs of revenue  increased by $112,403, or 17% (as compared to a 37% increase in rental, service and parts revenue)
from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Labor and contracted
services on a combined basis decreased by $44,193 or 15% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, due to improved utilization of existing resources. Depreciation increased by $88,695 or 56% from the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to a prospective change in the future estimated economic
lives for a pool of machines, an increase in the cost of equipment leased, as well as the timing of when the equipment became leased.
Parts and maintenance supplies increased by $67,901 or 36% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 due to higher demand. 

Equipment sales
cost of revenue  increased by $216,106 or 131% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September
30, 2016 due to increased sales. 

Gross Profit   

The following table breaks down gross profit
by type: 

The following table breaks down gross margin
by type: 

Rental, service
and parts gross margin  increased by 12.9% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September
30, 2016, a 121.7% increase. This improvement was the result of increases in revenues, changes in the mix of services and improved
utilization of existing resources. 

Equipment sales
gross margin  increased from a negative 19.7%, which was due to non-contractual sales of equipment at the end of several leases
at prices less than carrying costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to 29.7% during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, which is reflective of the higher level of unit sales and a shift in unit size mix. 

Operating expenses   

The following table breaks down operating
expenses by type: 

Selling, general
and administrative expenses  increased by $1,421,789 or 81% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The following table breaks down the major categories of selling, general and administrative expenses: 

Personnel related
expenses increased by $1,239,671 or 100% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
This increase was driven by adding staff to drive the strategic repositioning of the company and to support geographic expansion.
Personnel related expenses in 2016 also included $397,118 in stock based compensation, while there was none in 2015. Facility and
office costs increased by $48,558 or 23% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016
due to new office space and general growth in operations. Sales and marketing increased by 70,994 or 40% from the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to increases in travel and website related expenses. Other increased
by $62,566 or 51% primarily due to bad debt provisions of $70,467 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to
a net recovery of $17,082 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Research and development
expenses  increased by $170,549, or 35% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30,
2016. This change includes $105,548 of stock based compensation in 2016. 

Professional fees 
increased by $163,595, or 22% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The following
table breaks down the major categories of professional fees: 

Within
professional fees, legal expense decreased $130,030 or 40% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 primarily as a result of costs incurred in 2015 relating to the Swift acquisition. Audit and
accounting services expense increased $118,878 or 85% primarily due to services costs relating to being a newly public
company. During 2016, the Company engaged a strategic consulting firm that is providing services related to both the digester
and MBT business lines, which increased professional fees by $152,660. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Since inception, the
Company has sustained substantial losses. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $19,297,521 at September 30, 2016. 

The cash on hand is
insufficient for us to continue our operations through December 31, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company issued $3,400,000 in unsecured convertible debt as part of a private placement offering, primarily to management of the
Company. While the Company continues to seek investors under private placement offerings, if the Company is unable to obtain debt
or equity financing to meet its cash needs, it may have to severely limit its business plan by reducing the funds it hopes to expend
on its business plan. 

We do not yet have
a sustained history of financial stability. Historically, our principal source of liquidity has been the issuance of debt and equity
securities (including to related parties). These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. 

There can be no assurance
that the plans and actions proposed by management will be successful or that we will generate profitability and positive cash flows
in the future. We are exploring a number of options to provide working capital including seeking equity and/or debt financings.
We cannot assure you that we will consummate a financing that will enable us to meet our working capital needs. Future efforts
to raise additional funds may not be successful or they may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 

The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery
of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going
concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on management s plans, which include further
implementation of its business plan and continuing to raise capital. 

The Company is presently in the process
of raising additional non-registered convertible debt and capital for general operations, as well as for investment in several
strategic initiatives. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient debt or capital to sustain operations
or to pursue other strategic initiatives. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had cash balances of $176,103 and $39,195, respectively. 

The table below presents borrowings, debts
and advances as of September 30, 2016, along with their stated maturities. The line of credit, with an outstanding balance of $2,463,736
has an additional $36,264 available under its $2,500,000 facility. 

* The line of credit, which does not
contain any operating financial covenants, is guaranteed by several related parties and is excluded from the related party amount
included above, as the guarantees are secondary to the primary borrower. 

Cash Flows  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

We used $3,657,747
of cash in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1,421,730 from cash used in operating
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $4,970,741
was impacted by $512,318 of stock based compensation and $331,807 of depreciation and amortization. Changes in operating assets
and liabilities provided $343,326 of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, while they provided $858,863 of cash
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

Cash used in investing
activities amounted to $3,825 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to cash used investing activities of $35,499
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a change of $31,674, comprised of lower acquisitions of computer software and equipment
in 2016 and the 2015 QTAG proceeds. 

Equipment added to
equipment on operating leases is initially treated as an increase inventory (an operating activity) and then presented as a non-cash
transfer into equipment upon leasing. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the total of such transfers was $373,891,
as compared to $48,888 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 

Cash Flows from
Financing Activities  

Cash provided by financing
activities amounted to $3,733,583 the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,278,755 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, a change of $1,454,828. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $4,130,000 of proceeds
on borrowings, which was offset, in part, by $206,170 in repayments on debt. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have not entered
into any off-balance sheet arrangements during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.

company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(i) and are not required to provide information under this item. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures   

Our management carried
out an evaluation, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the  Exchange Act ). 

Based on their evaluation,
our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Because of our limited
operations we have a small number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. As we grow and expand our operations we
will engage additional employees and experts as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will expand. 

Changes in Internal Controls Over
Financial Reporting   

There have not been
any significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings.  

From time to time, we are a party to, or
otherwise involved in, legal proceedings arising in the normal and ordinary course of business. As of the date of this report,
we are not aware of any proceeding, threatened or pending, against us which, if determined adversely, would have a material effect
on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.  

We are a smaller reporting company as defined

On February 10, 2016,
April 14, 2016, May 27, 2016 and September 29, 2016, BioHiTech Global, Inc. (the  Registrant ) entered into a series
of Securities Purchase Agreements (the  Purchase Agreement ) with certain accredited investors (the  Investors ),
pursuant to which the Registrant agreed to sell and the Investors agreed to purchase in a private placement offering (the  Private
Placement ) units (the  Units ) in the aggregate offering amount of $2,500,000, $550,000, $200,000 and $150,000,
respectively. Each Unit, in the minimum subscription amount of $25,000 is comprised of a Convertible Promissory Note (the  Note )
and warrants (the  Warrants ) to purchase shares of the Registrant s common stock, par value $0.001 per share
(the  Common Stock ). Each Note bears interest at the rate of 8% per annum and is due on the earlier of: (i) February
10, 2018; (ii) the date the Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or NYSE MKT (the  Listing ); or (iii)
a  Change of Control  of the Registrant which is defined as a liquidation, dissolution, winding up, change in voting
control or sale of all or substantially all of the Registrant s assets. Each Note sold is convertible into shares of Common
Stock equal to the outstanding principal amount under the Note, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, divided by a conversion price
(the  Conversion Price ) equal to the lowest of: (i) the trading price on the date of the Listing; (ii) the price per
share paid by investors in a subsequent underwritten public offering in connection with the Listing; (iii) the lowest price paid
by investors in a subsequent offering of the Registrant s securities; (iv) the per share price in a Change of Control transaction;
or (v) $3.75 per share. Prior to maturity, an Investor may elect, at its option and in its sole discretion, to convert all or a
portion of the outstanding principal amount under the Note, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, into a number of shares of Common
Stock at a conversion price equal to $3.75 per share. The Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years into a number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes are convertible at an exercise price
equal to 120% of the Conversion Price. 

On July 19, 2016,
BioHiTech Global, Inc. (the  Company ) entered into a Consulting Service Agreement (the  Agreement ) with
Tusk Ventures LLC ( Tusk ) effective August 1, 2016 (the  Effective Date ). Tusk will provide strategic
political, regulatory and communications consulting services to the Company, for a term of 12 months from the Effective Date (subject
to a 60-day notice of termination by either party). In consideration for the services, the Company will pay Tusk a monthly cash
fee of $50,000, which the Company may defer payment on for no longer than four months, at which time all deferred payments shall
be due. The Company is required to pay Tusk an equity fee equal to $25,000 per month, which initially will take the form of convertible
notes and then, upon the mandatory conversion of certain of the Company s other convertible notes, the monthly equity fee
shall be paid in shares of the Company s Common Stock based upon the trailing month s average price per share. As of
November 1, 2016 the Company had issued three notes, each of $25,000 to Tusk under this Agreement. Each Note bears interest at
the rate of 8% per annum and is due on the earlier of: (i) February 10, 2018; (ii) the date the Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq
Stock Market or NYSE MKT (the  Listing ); or (iii) a  Change of Control  of the Registrant which is defined
as a liquidation, dissolution, winding up, change in voting control or sale of all or substantially all of the Registrant s
assets. Each Note sold is convertible into shares of Common Stock equal to the outstanding principal amount under the Note, plus
any accrued and unpaid interest, divided by a conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) equal to the lowest of: (i)
the trading price on the date of the Listing; (ii) the price per share paid by investors in a subsequent underwritten public offering
in connection with the Listing; (iii) the lowest price paid by investors in a subsequent offering of the Registrant s securities;
(iv) the per share price in a Change of Control transaction; or (v) $3.75 per share. Prior to maturity, an Investor may elect,
at its option and in its sole discretion, to convert all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount under the Note, plus
any accrued and unpaid interest, into a number of shares of Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $3.75 per share. 

On October 1, 2016,
BioHiTech Global, Inc. issued a convertible note in the amount of $300,000 to Bio Hitech International, Inc., an entity controlled
by Chun-Il Koh, a BioHiTech shareholder, for payment of amounts due by the Company for previously purchased equipment. The note
contains terms and requirements that are substantially similar to the Tusk note described in the preceding paragraph. 

The Company relied
on the exemptions from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder.
The Purchase Agreements and the Agreement contain representations to support the Company s reasonable belief that the investors
had access to information concerning the Company s operations and financial condition, the investors acquired the securities
for their own account and not with a view to the distribution thereof in the absence of an effective registration statement or
an applicable exemption from registration, and that the investors are sophisticated within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act and are  accredited investors  (as defined by Rule 501 under the Securities Act). In addition, the sale of securities
did not involve a public offering; the Company made no solicitation in connection with the sale other than communications with
the investors; the Company obtained representations from the investors regarding their investment intent, experience and sophistication;
and the investors either received or had access to adequate information about the Company in order to make an informed investment
decision.
