  (unaudited) 
   
  NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS    
  Resource Real Estate Investors 6, L.P. ( R-6  or the  Partnership ) is a Delaware limited partnership which owns through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and operates multifamily residential rental properties located in Texas (the  Properties ).  The Partnership also has invested in subordinated notes secured by multifamily residential properties located in California and Nevada.  The Partnership was formed on July 26, 2007 and commenced operations on October 1, 2007.  The Partnership was capitalized by an offering of partnership units which was closed on May 19, 2008.  The General Partner, Resource Capital Partners, Inc. ( RCP , the  General Partner  or the  GP ), is in the business of sponsoring and managing real estate investment limited partnerships.  RCP contributed   $1,000   in cash as its minimum capital contribution to the Partnership.  In addition, RCP held a   5.55%   limited partnership interest in the Partnership at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  RCP is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Resource America, Inc. ( RAI ), a company operating in the real estate, financial fund management and commercial finance sectors.  
       
  On September 8, 2016, RAI was acquired by C-III Capital Partners LLC ("C-III"), a leading commercial real estate services company engaged in a broad range of activities. C-III indirectly controls RCP and all of the partnership units of the Partnership currently owned by RCP. 
  The General Partner, in its discretion, may extend the Partnership's term for up to an aggregate of   two   years. The General Partner has complete and exclusive discretion in the management of the Partnership's business. Pursuant to the Partnership's limited partnership agreement, the Partnership's term was set to expire on July 31, 2015. On June 29, 2015, by written notice to the partners, the General Partner elected to extend the term for   one year   to July 30, 2016.  On May 20, 2016, by written notice to the partners, the General Partner elected to extend the term for   one   additional year to July 30, 2017 to maximize the Partnership's return to its partners.  The General Partner does not have the right to further extend the Partnership's term without the consent of the limited partner. In the event that the Partnership is unable to sell Park Hill before the July 30, 2017 termination date of the Agreement, the General Partner intends to extend the Partnership s term with the consent of the limited partners or would otherwise sell the property pursuant to the liquidations provisions of the Agreement. 
  The Partnership has begun the process of dissolution through the strategic disposal of assets.  On December 1, 2015, the Partnership sold its interest in Coach Lantern and Foxcroft.  Memorial Towers was sold on May 9, 2016. Villas of Henderson Pass was sold on September 26, 2016. The remaining asset, Park Hill, is expected to be disposed of in 2017.  
  The Partnership's First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the "Agreement") provides that income is allocated as follows: first, to the partners in proportion to and to the extent of the deficit balances, if any, in their respective capital accounts; second, to the partners in proportion to the allocations of Distributable Cash (as defined in the Agreement); and third,   100%   to the limited partners ( LPs ).  All losses are allocated as follows: first,   100%   to the LPs until the LPs have been allocated losses equal to the excess, if any, of their aggregate capital account balances over the aggregate Adjusted Capital Contributions (as defined in the Agreement); second, to the partners in proportion to and to the extent of their respective remaining positive capital account balances, if any; and third,   100%   to the LPs. 
  Distributable cash from operations, payable monthly, as determined by the GP, is first allocated   100%   to the LPs until the LPs have received their Preferred Return (as defined in the Agreement); and thereafter,   80%   to the LPs and   20%   to the GP. 
  Distributable cash from capital transactions, as determined by the GP, is first allocated   100%   to the LPs until the LPs have received their Preferred Return; second,   100%   to the LPs until their Adjusted Capital Contributions have been reduced to zero; and thereafter,   80%   to the LPs and   20%   to the GP. 
    
  The consolidated financial statements and the information and tables contained in the notes thereto as of   September 30, 2016   are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  However, in the opinion of management, these interim financial statements include all the necessary adjustments to fairly present the results of the interim periods presented.  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for

  NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
  A summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows: 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Partnership and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as follows: 
                       Subsidiaries 
      
    Number of Units 
      
    Location 
      RRE Memorial Towers Holdings, LLC ( Memorial Towers ) 

(1)   
      RRE Villas Holdings, LLC ( Villas ) 

(2)   
      RRE Coach Lantern Holdings, LLC ( Coach Lantern ) 

(3)   
      RRE Foxcroft Holdings, LLC ( Foxcroft ) 

(4)   
      RRE Park Hill Holdings, LLC ( Park Hill ) 
      
    288 
      
    San Antonio, Texas 
      Total 
      
    288 

(1) The partnership sold its interests in Memorial Towers on May 9, 2016.    
  (2) The partnership sold its interests in Villas on September 26, 2016. 
  (3) The partnership sold its interests in Coach Lantern on December 1, 2015.  The subsidiary was legally dissolved on September 6, 2016. 
  (4) The partnership sold its interests in Foxcroft on December 1, 2015.  The subsidiary was legally dissolved on September 6, 2016. 
  The Partnership also owns a   100%   interest in RRE Funding II, LLC ( Funding ), which owns a non-performing subordinated note, Southern Cove ( Southern Cove ), with a face value of   $500,000  .  Funding previously owned the non-performing subordinated note, Acacia Park ("Acacia"), which was paid off in July 2016 and had a face value of   $2 million  .  Both B notes went into default in 2009, and during the year ended December 31, 2012, they were deemed uncollectible and charged off.   The senior note, to which Acacia was subordinated, was partially paid off via refinance in July 2016.  The refinancing proceeds were not sufficient for Funding to recover any portion of the note.  Due to the refinancing, the Partnership no longer owns the note and RCP no longer manages the investment. 
  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Geographic Concentration Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership s net investment in real estate in San Antonio, Texas represented   100%   of the Partnership s total assets.  As a result, the geographic concentration of the Partnership s portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in San Antonio, Texas  real estate market. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in this market could adversely affect the Partnership s operating results. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  The Partnership estimates the allowance for uncollectible receivables and loan losses and adjusts the balance quarterly.  The Partnership also estimates the liability for real estate taxes on the properties and adjusts the balance quarterly.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Assets Held for Sale 
  The Partnership presents the assets and liabilities of any rental properties that qualify as held for sale separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  Subsequent to classification of an asset as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded. At   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had   no   rental properties included in Assets held for sale.

  (unaudited) 

Supplemental Disclosure of Cash Flow Information 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Partnership paid   $1.06 million   and   $1.50 million   in cash for interest, respectively.  
  Deferred Financing Costs 
  Costs incurred to obtain financing have been capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective yield method.  In accordance with adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03 "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", the Partnership has recorded deferred financing costs as a direct reduction of the related mortgage notes payable.  
  Income Taxes 
  The Partnership is not subject to income taxes as all earnings are taxable to the individual partners.  Income taxes or credits resulting from earnings or losses are payable by, or accrue to the benefit of, the partners; accordingly, no provision has been made for income taxes in these consolidated financial statements.   
  The Partnership evaluates the benefits of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax returns under a two-step recognition and measurement process.  Only the largest amount of benefits from the tax positions that will more likely than not be sustainable upon examination are recognized by the Partnership.  The Partnership does not have any unrecognized tax benefits, nor interest and penalties, recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Operations and does not anticipate significant adjustments to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 
  The Partnership is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and by the taxing authorities in those states in which the Partnership has significant business operations.  The Partnership is not currently undergoing any examinations by taxing authorities.  The Partnership may be subject to U.S. federal income tax and state/local income tax examinations for years 2013 through 2015. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Revenue is primarily derived from the rental of residential housing units with lease agreement terms of generally   one year   or less.  The Partnership recognizes revenue in the period that rent is earned, which is on a monthly basis.  The Partnership recognizes rent as income on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease.  Additionally, any incentives included in the lease are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. 
  Included within rental income are other income amounts such as utility reimbursements, late fees, parking fees, pet fees and lease application fees which are recognized when earned or received.  Total other income was   $141,000   and   $501,000   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Total other income was   $419,000   and   $719,000   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  The future minimum rental payments to be received from noncancelable operating leases total approximately   $1.4 million   and   $13,000   for the twelve months ending   September 30,   2017 and 2018, respectively, and   none   thereafter.  
  Loans Held for Investment, Net   
  The Partnership recognizes any revenue from the loans it holds for investment as interest income using the effective yield method. 
  The initial investment made in a purchased loan includes the amount paid to the seller plus any fees.  The initial investment frequently differs from the related loan s principal amount at the date of purchase.  This difference is recognized as an adjustment of the yield over the life of the loan. 
  The Partnership initially records its loans at their respective purchase prices, and subsequently accounts for them based on their outstanding principal plus or minus any unamortized premiums or discounts. 
  Long-Lived Assets 
  The Partnership reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If it is determined that an asset s estimated future cash flows will not be

  (unaudited) 

sufficient to recover its carrying amount, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the carrying amount for that asset to its estimated fair value.   The Partnership has estimated that the future cash flows from its properties will be sufficient to recover their carrying amounts and, as a result, the Partnership did not recognize any impairment losses with respect to its Properties for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .   
  Rental Properties 
  Rental properties are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.  Buildings and improvements and personal property are depreciated for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.  The value of in-place leases is amortized over twelve months on a straight-line basis.  Useful lives used for calculating depreciation for financial reporting purposes are as follows: 

Advertising 
  The Partnership expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.  Advertising costs, which are included in rental operating expenses, totaled approximately   $15,000   and   $55,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $34,000   and   $94,000   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Partnership to concentration of credit risk, consist of periodic temporary deposits of cash. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides insurance for all deposit accounts, deposits and accrued interest, in the amount of $250,000 per depositor held at an insured bank. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Partnership had approximately   $9.5 million   of deposits at various banks,   $8.7 million   of which were over the insurance limit of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.   
  Reclassifications 
  Certain amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  At December 31, 2015 assets held for sale as previously reported in the amount of   $11.2 million   did not include the associated accumulated depreciation in the amount of   $3.3 million   related to this property.  The impact of this correction is not material and did not affect net income.  
  In accordance with the adoption of  FASB ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", the Partnership has reclassified   $218,000   of debt issuance costs at December 31, 2015 from assets to liabilities as a direct reduction of the related mortgage notes payable. 
  Tenant Receivables 
  Tenant receivables are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from tenants net of an allowance for uncollectible receivables.  Payment terms vary and receivables outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due.  The Partnership determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, security deposits held, the Partnership s previous loss history, the tenants  current ability to pay their obligations to the Partnership, the general condition of the economy and the condition of the industry as a whole.  The Partnership writes off receivables when they become uncollectible.  At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the allowance for uncollectible receivables was   zero  . 
  Redemptions 
  The LPs may request redemption of their units at any time.  The Partnership has no obligation to redeem any units and will do so only at the GP s discretion.  If the Partnership redeems units, the redemption price is generally the amount of the initial investment less all distributions from the Partnership to the LP, and less an allocation of all organization and offering expenses charged to the LP.

Sale of Rental Property 
    
  The Partnership recognized the gains on sales of rental properties separately in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Sales of rental properties completed by the Partnership do not represent a significant strategic shift in operations and, accordingly, the Partnership does not present discontinued operations. For information regarding the sales of the rental properties, see Note 7 . 
    
  Recent Accounting Standards 
    In January 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, "Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items." ("ASU 2015-01").  The amendments in ASU 2015-01 eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Although the amendment will eliminate the requirements for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring.  ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Partnership adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2016; however, it did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis" ( ASU 2015-02 ), which makes certain changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model, including changes to (1) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (2) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination. ASU 2015-02 is effective for the Partnership beginning January 1, 2016.  The Partnership adopted this guidance and the adoption had no impact  on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" ("ASU 2015-03"), which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. This guidance is effective for the Partnership beginning January 1, 2016. As required by ASU 2015-03, the Partnership applied the new guidance on a retrospective basis and adjusted the balance sheet of each individual period presented to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. The Partnership has reclassified   $218,000   of debt issuance costs at December 31, 2015 from assets to liabilities as a direct reduction of the related mortgage notes payable.   
  In September 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments" ("ASU 2015-16"), which eliminates the requirement to retroactively revise comparative financial information for prior periods presented in financial statements due to changes in provisional amounts recorded for acquisitions in subsequent periods. Disclosure of the amounts recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date are required. The Partnership adopted this guidance; however, it did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
    Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective. 
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ("ASU 2014-09"), which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP.  The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Partnership beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in 2018, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption.  The Partnership is in the process of assessing the impact of this guidance on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." Under the new guidance, an entity should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the new requirements is not expected to have a significant impact on the Partnership's consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASU No. 2016-02"), which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions and requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Partnership is continuing to evaluate this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  (ASU No. 2016-13) which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The standard update is effective for the Partnership beginning January 1, 2019. The Partnership is continuing to evaluate this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" ("ASU No. 2016-15"), which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 has been early adopted by the Partnership.  As result of adoption, the Partnership has classified cash paid in early extinguishment of debt as cash used in financing activities.  

NOTE 3 - RESTRICTED CASH

Annual principal payments on the mortgage notes payable for each of the next two years ending   September 30,   are as follows (in thousands):  

The mortgage note payable is with recourse only to the property securing it subject to certain limited standard exceptions, as defined in the mortgage note, which the GP has guaranteed with respect to the property.  These exceptions are referred to as  carveouts .  In general, carveouts relate to damages suffered by the lender for a subsidiary s failure to pay rents, insurance or condemnation proceeds to the lender, to pay water, sewer and other public assessments or charges, to pay environmental compliance costs or to deliver books and records, in each case as required in the loan documents.  The exceptions also require the GP to guarantee payment of audit costs, lender s enforcement of its rights under the loan documents and payment of the loan if the subsidiary voluntarily files for bankruptcy or seeks reorganization, or if a related party of the subsidiary does so with respect to the subsidiary. 
  Deferred Financing Costs 
    Deferred financing costs include unamortized costs incurred to obtain financing which are being amortized over the term of the related debt.  Accumulated amortization was   $484,000   and   $1.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Estimated amortization of the Property s existing deferred financing costs for the next two years ending   September 30,   is as follows (in thousands): 

NOTE 5 - CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    
       
  On September 8, 2016, RAI was acquired by C-III Capital Partners LLC, a leading commercial real estate services company engaged in a broad range of activities. C-III indirectly controls RCP and all of the partnership units of the Partnership currently owned by RCP. 
  In the ordinary course of its business operations, the Partnership has ongoing relationships with several related entities.  Receivables from and payables to related parties are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

Substantially all of the receivables from related parties represent escrow funds held by RAI for self-insurance.  The Partnership's properties participate in insurance pools with other properties directly and indirectly managed by RAI for both property insurance and general liability.  RAI holds the escrow funds related to the insurance pool on its books.   The insurance pool covers losses up to   $2.5 million   for property losses and the first   $50,000   of each general liability incident. Catastrophic insurance would cover property losses in excess of the insurance pool up to   $140 million  .  Therefore, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of the Partnership's insured limits could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's financial condition and operating results. In the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , the Partnership paid approximately   $97,000   into the insurance pools.

RCP is entitled to receive an annual investment management fee, payable monthly, equal to   1%   of the gross offering proceeds that have been deployed in real estate investments, net of any amounts otherwise attributable to LP interests owned by RCP.  During the term of the Partnership, RCP must subordinate up to   100%   of its annual investment management fee to the receipt by the LPs of their Preferred Return.  Investment management fees due to RCP at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled   $62,000   and   $2.7 million  , respectively. The Partnership used proceeds of both the sale of Memorial Towers and Villas to provide the LPs their Preferred Return.  The remaining proceeds were used to pay any accrued investment management fees due to RCP.  
  A wholly-owned subsidiary of RCP, Resource Real Estate Management, LLC ( RREML ), is entitled to receive property and debt management fees as set forth in the table below.  RREML engaged Resource Real Estate Management, Inc ( RREMI ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of RAI, to manage the Partnership s properties.  Management fees due to RCP and affiliates at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled   $30,000   and   $563,000  , respectively.  Debt Management fees due to RCP and affiliates at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled   $40,000   and   $12,000  , respectively.  The Partnership stopped accruing the Debt Management fee associated with the Acacia note as of July 1, 2016.  The senior note, to which Acacia was subordinated, was partially paid off via refinancing in July 2016.  Due to the refinancing, the Partnership no longer owns the note and RCP no longer manages the investment. 
  The Partnership has also made payment for legal services to the law firm of Ledgewood P.C. ("Ledgewood").  Two former members of Ledgewood were, until September 2016, executive officers, and one such former member was also a director, of RAI.  Total expenses paid to Ledgewood were   $21,000   and   $40,000   for the   three   and   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $11,000   and   $17,000   for the   three   and   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  . 
  During the ordinary course of business, RCP and RREMI advance funds for ordinary operating expenses on behalf of the Properties.  Operating expense advances due to RCP and RREMI at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled   $34,000   and   $204,000  , respectively. Total operating expenses reimbursed during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $244,000   and   $848,000   as compared to   $407,000   and   $1.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Reimbursed expenses include payroll and miscellaneous operating expenses. Reimbursed operating expenses are included in rental operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  The Partnership is obligated to pay fees and reimbursements of expenses to related parties.  These activities are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    RREML is entitled to receive monthly property management fees equal to   5%   of the gross operating revenues from the Partnership s   100%   owned properties for managing or obtaining and supervising third party managers. 
              (2) 
    RREML is also entitled to receive monthly debt management fees equal to   0.167%   (  2%   per annum) of the gross offering proceeds that have been invested in loans held for investment.  The fee is earned for monitoring the performance of the Partnership s loans held for investment. 
      
  NOTE 6 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
  In analyzing the fair value of its financial instruments disclosed or accounted for on a fair value basis, the Partnership follows the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The Partnership determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or, if quoted prices are not available, through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the financial instruments.  The fair value of cash, tenant receivables, and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to their short term nature.  The hierarchy followed defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 
  Level 1 -   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2 -   Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset. 
  Level 3 -   Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques. 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:  
             
    Mortgage notes payable.    Rates currently available to the Partnership for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of existing debt.

Overview 
  We are a Delaware limited partnership that was formed on July 26, 2007 and commenced operations on October 1, 2007.  Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we own in fee and operate in multifamily residential rental properties located, after giving affect to recent property sales, in Texas, which we refer to as our property.  Historically, we also invested through a wholly owned subsidiary in subordinated notes secured by multifamily residential rental properties. 
  We have begun the process of dissolution through the strategic disposal of assets.  On December 1, 2015, we sold our interest in Coach Lantern and Foxcroft.  Memorial Towers was sold on May 9, 2016, and Villas was sold on September 26, 2016.  We expect to dispose the remaining asset, Park Hill, in 2017.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we own one multifamily residential rental property through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, as follows: 
   
 _______________ 
           (1) 
    Original face value of mortgage divided by the original total property capitalization, including original reserves, escrows, fees and closing costs. 
          
  The following table sets forth operating statistics about the multifamily residential rental properties owned during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  Although Villas was sold on September 26, 2016, we have included it below, since it was owned for nearly the entire quarter:

              (3) 
    Includes rental operating expenses and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of rental income. 
       
  We also own a subordinated note, which we refer to as the Real Estate Debt Investment, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RRE Funding II, LLC, or Funding, which was formed to hold title to the Real Estate Debt Investment which, as of   September 30, 2016  , was as follows (in thousands, except units and percentages):

Funding previously owned the non-performing subordinated note, Acacia Park ("Acacia"), which was paid off in July 2016 and had a face value of   $2 million  .  Both B notes went into default in 2009, and during the year ended December 31, 2012, they were deemed uncollectible and charged off.   The senior note, to which Acacia was subordinated, was partially paid off via refinance in July 2016.  The refinancing proceeds were not sufficient for Funding to recover any portion of the note.  Due to the refinancing, the Partnership no longer owns the note and RCP no longer manages the investment.

Results of Operations 
    
  We generate our income from the net revenues we receive from our Properties.  We also have generated funds from the sale of our Properties.  Although unlikely, the sale or repayment of our Real Estate Debt Investment may also generate funds.  We expect that we will sell the remaining property, Park Hill, within the next fiscal year as the Partnership winds down. We sold Memorial Towers on May 9, 2016, and Villas on September 26, 2016.  In view of its defaulted status, we do not expect any repayments from, or to be able to sell, the Southern Cove investment.  Should economic conditions in the area in which our remaining property, Park Hill, is located deteriorate, we could experience lower occupancy, lower rental revenues and higher operating costs, all of which could harm our operations and financial condition, reduce the value of the property and limit or eliminate our ability to make distributions to our limited partners. 
  Our operating results and cash flows from our Properties are affected by four principal factors: 
             
    occupancy and rental rates, 
                
    property operating expenses, 
                
    interest rates on the related financing, and 
                
    capital expenditures. 
          The amount of rental revenues from the property depends upon the occupancy rates, rental rates, and concessions granted.  We seek to maximize our rental revenue through aggressive property-level programs, in particular, our Lease Rent Optimizer, or LRO, program which includes rent concessions and a substantial capital improvements program.  Under our LRO program, we seek to price our rents for apartment units on a daily basis, based upon inventory in the marketplace and competitors  pricing.  Our Properties remained consistent compared to the same period in 2015 in regards to the average occupancy rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, with an average occupancy of   93.6%  .  The average effective rent per square foot increased by   $0.02   across the Properties during the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  We seek to control operating expenses through our General Partner s automated purchase order system that compares actual to budgeted expenses and requires management approval of variances, and through the use of third-party service providers to seek best available pricing. 
  Our existing financing is at a fixed rate of interest, and accordingly, our interest cost has remained stable during the period of our ownership of the Property.  Because our existing financing extends through 2018, we expect that our financing cost will remain stable during fiscal 2016. 
  Under our capital improvements program, more particularly described in  Liquidity and Capital Resources,  we could potentially spend approximately   $90,000   during the remainder of the Partnership term for property improvements intended to increase the remaining property s appeal to tenants and potential purchasers.  As we implement planned improvements, we seek to maintain our occupancy rates and, potentially, increase rental rates to ensure that we maximize the return to our Partners.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated (in thousands):   

  Revenues 
  Revenues for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   decreased by   (53)%   due to the   $906,000   reduction of revenue related to sold properties, Coach Lantern and Foxcroft, as well as a   $518,000   loss of revenue from the recently sold property, Memorial Towers.  
  Expenses 
  We attribute the   $1,043,000   overall decrease in expenses principally to: 
               
    a   $50,000   decrease in property and general liability insurance claims across the RAI managed portfolio, 
                
    a   $141,000   decrease in real estate taxes primarily due to the sale of properties, and 
                 
    a   $461,000   decrease in depreciation and amortization due to the sale of properties and assets held for sale as of December 31, 2015, partially offset by; 
                
    a   $109,000   increase in general and administrative expenses due largely to an increase in franchise taxes associated with gains from the property sales.

  The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated (in thousands):   

  Revenues 
  Revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   decreased by   42%   due to the loss of revenues related primarily to three of the sold properties, Coach Lantern, Foxcroft and Memorial Towers in the amount of   $3.3 million  .  The decrease was partially offset by an increase in average effective rent for the   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  
  Expenses 
  We attribute the   $2.42 million   overall decrease in expenses principally to: 
             
    a   $290,000   decrease in management fees due to a decrease in revenue attributable to the sale of Foxcroft, Coach Lantern and Memorial Towers. 
                 
    a   $112,000   decrease in property and general liability insurance claims across the RAI managed portfolio, 
                
    a   $252,000   decrease in real estate taxes primarily due to the sale of properties, and 
                
    a   $782,000   decrease in operating expenses primarily due to the sale of properties. 
                 
    a   $128,000   increase in general and administrative expenses due largely to an increase in franchise taxes associated with gains from the property sales.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash (in thousands): 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Including changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
     Our liquidity needs consist principally of funds to pay debt service, required escrow payments, operating expenses, capital expenditures and monthly distributions to the limited partners.  Our ability to meet our liquidity needs historically has been subject to our ability to generate cash from both operations and sales, and to control property operating expenses.  However, as a result of the sales of Foxcroft and Coach Lantern, we have generated enough funds to cover operating expenses, capital expenditures and monthly distributions. Moreover, as a result of the sale of Memorial Towers, we have generated enough funds to distribute the limited partner's preferred return as well as the subordinated investment management fees owed.  The sale of Villas on September 26, 2016 generated enough funds to distribute the limited partner's additional preferred return.  Excess cash is held for any unforeseen expenses in addition to debt service, operating expenses, capital expenditures and monthly distributions to the limited partners.  Although our property sales have generated significant current liquidity, we still seek to generate positive cash from operations. The ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend on the occupancy rates, rates charged to tenants compared with competing properties in the area and the ability of tenants to pay rent.  Occupancy rates can fluctuate based on changes in local market conditions in San Antonio, Texas, where the remaining property, Park Hill, is located such as: excessive building resulting in an oversupply of similar properties, deterioration of surrounding areas, a decrease in market rates or local economic conditions including unemployment rates.  The rental rates charged to tenants compared to competing properties can be impacted by a lack of perceived safety, convenience and attractiveness of a property.  
  Under our capital improvements program, we review future possible expenditures periodically and adjust them based on both operating results and local market conditions.  If market conditions improve and we believe we can achieve an acceptable return on the additional expenditures, we will consider property improvements to increase the property's appeal to tenants and potential purchasers and to the extent possible, increase the value of the remaining property, Park Hill. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had identified approximately   $90,000   of possible capital improvements.  To the extent that we implement planned improvements to the property, we will seek to maintain our stable occupancy rates and, potentially, increase rental rates and our cash flow from operating activities in order to pay for these improvements.  
  The following table sets forth the capital expenditures incurred during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and estimated future capital expenditures which are discretionary in nature (in thousands): 

Funding for future discretionary capital expenditures over the remaining life of the Partnership will come principally from future operating cash flows and to a lesser extent, from cash on hand.  We review future expenditures periodically and adjust them based on both operating results, local market conditions and our expected return on the investment of capital.  We cannot assure you that we will complete any or all of the projects currently planned or that we will not change our plans in response to changes in market conditions.  Any excess cash flow not used for future discretionary capital expenditures would be distributed to our investors. 
  Our restricted cash represents escrow deposits with lenders to be used to pay real estate taxes, insurance and capital improvements.

Our payables to related parties consist of investment, debt and property management fees due to our General Partner, payable monthly, equal to 1% of the gross offering proceeds, net of any limited partnership interests owned by the General Partner.  The General Partner must subordinate up to 100% of its annual investment management fee to the receipt by the limited partners of their Preferred Return.  The Partnership used proceeds of both the sale of Memorial Towers and Villas to provide the LPs their Preferred Return.  The remaining proceeds were used to pay any accrued investment management fees due to RCP.    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate debt service requirement for the Park Hill mortgage over the next 12 months is   $676,000  .  This includes principal payments of   $173,000  .  Future escrow payments of approximately   $667,000   are to be paid over the next 12 months. The Partnership sold Villas of Henderson Pass for   $18 million   on September 26, 2016, using proceeds from sale to pay the remaining mortgage balance.  
  Redemption of Units 
  We are permitted, in our General Partner s sole discretion, to redeem units upon a unitholder s request.  However, we have no obligation to redeem units at any time, and we can decline to redeem units for any reason.  As of   September 30, 2016   and 2015 we have redeemed 11,602 units at an aggregate redemption price of $88,784.  No units were redeemed in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Legal Proceedings 
  We are a party to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business.  Management believes that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and cost and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to certain accrued liabilities.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  For a discussion on our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the discussion in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations, including contingent obligations, other than guarantees by the General Partner of certain limited standard expectations to the non-recourse nature of the mortgage notes which are secured by the Properties.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our General Partner, including its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
    
  Under the supervision of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our General Partner, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our General Partner concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
