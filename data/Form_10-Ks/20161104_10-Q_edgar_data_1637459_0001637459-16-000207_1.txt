  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
   
  Note 1.  Background and Basis of Presentation 
  Basis of Presentation: 
  Our interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been omitted, in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). In management s opinion, these interim financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary to present fairly our results for the periods presented. 
  The condensed consolidated balance sheet data at January 3, 2016 was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. You should read these statements in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 2016. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results. 
  Organization: 
  On July 2, 2015 (the  2015 Merger Date ), through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. ( Kraft ) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation ( Heinz ) (the  2015 Merger ). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company ( Kraft Heinz ). 
  Before the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P. (together, the  Sponsors ), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company (the  2013 Merger ) on June 7, 2013 (the  2013 Merger Date ). 
  Changes in Accounting and Reporting:  
  Consistent with our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 2016, we separately presented sold receivables on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows. Our prior period cash flow balances have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards: 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued an accounting standards update ( ASU ) that superseded previously existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this ASU, companies will apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. The ASU may be applied retrospectively to historical periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued an ASU intended to simplify the accounting for measurement period adjustments in a business combination. Measurement period adjustments are changes to provisional amounts recorded when the accounting for a business combination is incomplete as of the end of a reporting period. The measurement period can extend for up to a year following the transaction date. During the measurement period, companies may make adjustments to provisional amounts when information necessary to complete the measurement is received. The ASU requires companies to recognize these adjustments, including any related impacts to net income, in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined. Companies are no longer required to retroactively apply measurement period adjustments to all periods presented. We early adopted this ASU in 2015. See Note 2,   Merger and Acquisition  , for additional information on measurement period adjustments related to the 2015 Merger. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that superseded previously existing leasing guidance. The ASU is intended to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. The new guidance requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures, but we expect that the adoption will significantly increase the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU intended to simplify equity-based award accounting and presentation. The ASU impacts income tax accounting related to equity-based awards, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 
  
   6 

In August 2016, the FASB issued an ASU related to the classification of certain cash payments and cash receipts on the statement of cash flows. This ASU provides guidance on eight specific cash flow classification matters in order to reduce current and future diversity in practice. The ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance related to each of the eight separate classification matters must be adopted in the same period using a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact that this ASU will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
  Note 2.  Merger and Acquisition 
  Transaction Overview: 
  The 2015 Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and Heinz was considered to be the acquiring company. Under the acquisition method of accounting, total consideration exchanged was (in millions):  

Valuation Assumptions and Purchase Price Allocation: 
  We utilized estimated fair values at the 2015 Merger Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such allocation was final as of July 3, 2016.    
  During the first half of 2016, we made measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation primarily reflecting (i) a decrease in indefinite-lived intangible assets of   $2.0 billion  , (ii) a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities of   $564 million  , and (iii) an increase in goodwill of   $1.4 billion  . We made these measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the 2015 Merger Date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date.    
  The final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction was (in millions): 

The 2015 Merger resulted in   $30.5 billion   of non tax deductible goodwill relating principally to synergies expected to be achieved from the combined operations and planned growth in new markets. Goodwill has been allocated to our segments as shown in Note 5,   Goodwill and Intangible Assets  .  
  
   7 

Pro Forma Results: 
  The following table provides unaudited pro forma results, prepared in accordance with ASC 805, for the   three and nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  , as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. 

The unaudited pro forma results include certain purchase accounting adjustments. We have made pro forma adjustments to exclude deal costs of   $96 million   (  $59 million   net of tax) for the three months and   $166 million   (  $102 million   net of tax) for the   nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  , and to exclude   $347 million   (  $213 million   net of tax) of non-cash costs related to the fair value step-up of Kraft s inventory ( Inventory Step-up Costs ) for the three and nine months ended   September 27, 2015  , because such costs are non-recurring and are directly attributable to the 2015 Merger. These expenses were included in the prior year pro forma results. 
  The unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of future integration or restructuring efforts. Unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of results had the 2015 Merger occurred on December 30, 2013 or of future results. 
   
  Note 3.  Integration and Restructuring Expenses 
  Following the 2015 Merger, we announced a multi-year program (the  Integration Program ) designed to reduce costs, as well as integrate and optimize the combined organization. As part of the Integration Program, we incur expenses (primarily employee separations, lease terminations, and other direct exit costs) that qualify as exit and disposal costs under U.S. GAAP. We also incur expenses that are an integral component of, and directly attributable to, our restructuring activities, which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs (primarily accelerated depreciation, asset impairments, implementation costs such as new facility relocation and start-up costs, and other incremental costs).    
    
  Employee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements, local statutory requirements, or historical benefit practices. We recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable; additional elements of severance and termination benefits associated with non-recurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employee s required future service period. Asset-related costs consist primarily of accelerated depreciation and, to a lesser degree, asset impairments. Charges for accelerated depreciation are recognized on long-lived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service, in which case depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life. Asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held for disposal or sale and those assets are written down to expected net realizable value if carrying value exceeds fair value. All other costs are recognized as incurred. 
  Integration Program:  
  We currently expect the Integration Program will result in   $1.9 billion   of pre-tax costs, with approximately   60%   reflected in cost of products sold, comprised of the following categories: 
             
    Organization costs (  $650 million  ) associated with our plans to streamline and simplify our operating structure, resulting in workforce reduction. These costs primarily include severance and employee benefits (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, and pension and other termination benefits). In August 2015, we announced a new, streamlined structure for our businesses in the United States and Canada segments. This resulted in the reduction of salaried positions across the United States and Canada. Overall, we expect to eliminate   3,350   positions in connection with this reduction.  
                
    Footprint costs (  $1.1 billion  ) associated with our plans to optimize our production and supply chain network, resulting in facility closures and consolidations. These costs primarily include asset-related costs (accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges), costs to exit facilities, relocation and start-up costs of new facilities, and severance and employee benefits.   On November 4, 2015, we announced our plans to close   seven   factories and began a consolidation of our distribution network. On September 13, 2016, we announced that one of the previously announced   seven   factories, our Fullerton, California factory, would remain open. In a staged process, production in the other six locations is shifting to  
     
   8 

other existing factories in the United States and Canada. Overall, we expect to close   six   factories and eliminate   1,900     positions in connection with these activities. 
             
    Other costs (  $150 million  ) incurred as a direct result of integration activities, primarily including contract and lease terminations, professional fees, and other incremental third-party fees.  
     As of     October 2, 2016  , we have incurred approximately   $1.6 billion   of cumulative costs under the Integration Program, including:   $676 million   of severance and employee benefit costs,   $539 million   of non-cash asset-related costs,   $241 million   of other implementation costs, and   $95 million   of other exit costs. We expect that approximately   60%   of the Integration Program expenses will be cash expenditures. Our Integration Program costs during the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   were (in millions): 

At   October 2, 2016  , the total Integration Program liability related primarily to the elimination of general salaried and footprint-related positions across the United States and Canada,   3,250   of whom have left the company by   October 2, 2016  . The liability balance associated with the Integration Program, which qualifies as U.S. GAAP exit and disposal costs, was (in millions):  

(a)    Other exit costs primarily represent contract and lease terminations. 
  We expect that a substantial portion of the Integration Program liability as of   October 2, 2016   will be paid in 2016. 
  Restructuring Activities: 
  Prior to the 2015 Merger, we executed a number of other restructuring activities focused primarily on workforce reduction and factory closure and consolidation, which were substantially complete as of   October 2, 2016  . These programs, and other programs, resulted in the elimination of   8,250   positions and cumulative   $569 million   severance and employee benefit costs,   $337 million   non-cash asset-related costs, and   $390 million   other exit costs through   October 2, 2016  . Related to these restructuring activities, we incurred expenses of   $15 million   for the three months and   $59 million   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  . 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , the liability balance associated with active restructuring projects, which qualifies as U.S. GAAP exit and disposal costs, was (in millions): 

(a)    Other exit costs primarily represent contract and lease terminations. 
  We expect that a substantial portion of the active restructuring projects liability as of   October 2, 2016   will be paid in 2016. 

9 

Total Integration and Restructuring: 
  Our total Integration Program and restructuring expenses recorded in cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) were (in millions): 

We do not include Integration Program and restructuring expenses within Segment Adjusted EBITDA. See Note 14,   Segment Reporting  , for additional information on our segment structure. The pre-tax impact of allocating such expenses to our segments would have been (in millions): 

Note 4.  Inventories 
  Inventories at   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016   were (in millions): 

The increase in inventories as of   October 2, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in inventory production ahead of planned facility closures and consolidations under our Integration Program, combined with the impact of seasonality. See Note 3,   Integration and Restructuring Expenses  , for additional information on the Integration Program. 
   
  Note 5.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill: 
  Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill from   January 3, 2016   to   October 2, 2016  , by segment, were (in millions): 

In connection with the 2015 Merger, we recorded   $30.5 billion   of goodwill in purchase accounting, representing the fair value as of the 2015 Merger Date. As of July 3, 2016, the assignment of goodwill to reporting units was final.   During the first half of 2016, we made measurement period adjustments to the 2015 Merger purchase price allocation, resulting in an increase of   $1.4 billion    
  
   10 

to goodwill in the United States segment. See Note 2,   Merger and Acquisition  , for additional information on these measurement period adjustments. 
  In the first quarter of 2016, we moved certain of our export businesses and their related goodwill balances from our United States segment to our Rest of World and Europe segments. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. Accordingly, the segment goodwill balances at January 3, 2016 reflect a decrease of   $1,473 million   in the United States, an increase of   $1,443 million   in Rest of World, and an increase of   $30 million   in Europe. These amounts represent the final allocation of goodwill associated with these export businesses.    
  In the third quarter of 2016, we announced planned changes to our segment structure. We expect that these changes will become effective December 31, 2016. For additional information on these changes, see Note 14,   Segment     Reporting  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements.    
  We test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. We performed our 2016 annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2016.   There was   no   impairment of goodwill as a result of our testing; however we noted that   one   reporting unit within the Rest of World segment had an estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value of less than   10%  . The goodwill carrying value of this reporting unit was   $48 million   as of April 4, 2016 (our goodwill impairment testing date).    
  Our goodwill balance consists of a large number of individual reporting units and had an aggregate carrying value of   $44.5 billion   as of   October 2, 2016  . As a majority of our goodwill was recently recorded in connection with the 2013 Merger and the 2015 Merger, representing fair values as of those merger dates, there is not a significant excess of fair values over carry values as of October 2, 2016. We have a risk of future impairment to the extent that individual reporting unit performance does not meet our projections. Additionally, if our current assumptions and estimates, including projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors, are not met, or if valuation factors outside of our control change unfavorably, the estimated fair value of our goodwill could be adversely affected, leading to a potential impairment in the future. No events occurred during the three months ended   October 2, 2016   that indicated it was more likely than not that our goodwill was impaired. There were   no   accumulated impairment losses to goodwill as of   October 2, 2016  . 
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets: 
  In connection with the 2015 Merger, we recorded   $43.1 billion   of indefinite-lived intangible assets in purchase accounting, representing the fair values as of the 2015 Merger Date. 
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consisted of trademarks, were (in millions): 

We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs. We performed our 2016 annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2016.   There was   no   impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles as a result of our testing; however, we noted that   seven   brands each had excess fair value over its carrying value of less than   10%  . These brands had an aggregate carrying value of   $6.1 billion   at April 4, 2016 (our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing date).   Of the   $6.1 billion   aggregate carrying value,   $5.6 billion   was attributable to   Velveeta  ,   Lunchables  ,   Maxwell     House  , and   Cracker     Barrel  .    
  Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of a large number of individual brands and had an aggregate carrying value of   $53.5 billion   as of   October 2, 2016  . As a majority of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were recently recorded in connection with the 2013 Merger and the 2015 Merger, representing fair values as of those merger dates, there is not a significant excess of fair values over carry values as of October 2, 2016. We have a risk of future impairment to the extent individual brand performance does not meet our projections. Additionally, if our current assumptions and estimates, including projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors, are not met, or if valuation factors outside of our control change unfavorably, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could be adversely affected, leading to potential impairments in the future. No events occurred during the three months ended   October 2, 2016   that indicated it was more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. 
  
   11 

Definite-lived intangible assets: 
  Definite-lived intangible assets at   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016   were (in millions):   

  Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was   $66 million   for the three months and   $198 million   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   and was   $66 million   for the three months and   $111 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  . Aside from amortization expense, the changes in definite-lived intangible assets from   January 3, 2016   to   October 2, 2016   reflect the impact of foreign currency. We estimate that annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets for each of the next five years will be approximately   $275 million  . 
   
  Note 6.  Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment; accordingly, the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings and applicable tax rates in various locations. 
  The effective tax rate was an expense of   23.7%   for the   three months   and   27.9%   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , in comparison to the benefit of   29.1%   for the   three months   and   92.4%   for the   nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  .   Our current effective tax rate reflects the favorable benefit of non-U.S. jurisdictions with lower tax rates, the U.S. manufacturing deduction, as well as the deferred tax effect of statutory tax rate changes and adjustments.   The change in our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the three and nine months ended   September 27, 2015     was driven by the 2015 Merger as well as the impact of tax law changes and deferred tax adjustments.     With the 2015 Merger, our operations in the United States and Canada increased, resulting in an unfavorable impact to the effective tax rate of higher blended statutory tax rates and a favorable impact to the effective tax rate of a larger U.S. manufacturing deduction.    
   
  Note 7.  Employees  Stock Incentive Plans 
  Our annual equity award grants and vesting occurred in the first quarter of 2016. Other off-cycle equity grants may occur throughout the year. 
  Stock Options: 
  Our stock option activity and related information was: 

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the period was   $170 million   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  .  
  
   12 

Restricted Stock Units: 
  Our restricted stock unit ( RSU ) activity and related information was: 

The aggregate fair value of RSUs that vested during the period was   $38 million   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  . 
  Total Equity Awards: 
  The compensation cost related to equity awards was primarily recognized in general corporate expenses within SG A. Equity award compensation cost and the related tax benefit was (in millions):   

  Unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested equity awards was   $97 million   at   October 2, 2016   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   three   years. 
   
  Note 8.  Postemployment Benefits 
  In the first quarter of 2016, we changed the method that we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension cost/(benefit) and net postretirement cost/(benefit). We use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The change resulted in a decrease in service and interest cost of approximately   $20 million   in the three months ended   October 2, 2016   and approximately   $60 million   in the nine months ended October 2, 2016 compared to what our costs would have been under the previous method. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

Pension Plans 
  Components of Net Pension Cost/(Benefit): 
  Net pension cost/(benefit) consisted of the following for the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   (in millions): 

We capitalized a portion of net pension costs/(benefits) into inventory based on our production activities. These amounts are included in the table above. 
  In the third quarter of 2016, we approved the wind up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans effective December 31, 2016. This action had no impact on the condensed consolidated statements of income, condensed consolidated balance sheets, or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows as at and for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016.  
  Employer Contributions: 
  During the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , we contributed   $311 million   to our U.S. pension plans, which included contributions related to the settlement of our U.S. nonqualified pension plan that was terminated effective December 31, 2015. During the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , we contributed   $21 million   to our non-U.S. pension plans. Based on our contribution strategy, we plan to make further contributions of up to approximately   $5 million   to our non-U.S. plans during the remainder of 2016.     We are not planning to make any further contributions to our U.S. plans during the remainder of 2016. However, our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit or other laws, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors.  
  Postretirement Plans 
  Components of Net Postretirement Cost/(Benefit): 
  Net postretirement cost/(benefit) consisted of the following for the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   (in millions): 

We capitalized a portion of net postretirement costs/(benefits) into inventory based on our production activities. These amounts are included in the table above. 
  
   14 

Note 9.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Losses) 
  The components of, and changes in, accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) were as follows (net of tax): 

Reclassification of net postemployment benefit losses/(gains) included amounts reclassified to net income and amounts reclassified into inventory (consistent with our capitalization policy). 
  The gross amount and related tax benefit/(expense) recorded in, and associated with, each component of other comprehensive income/(loss) for the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   were as follows (in millions): 

In the third quarter of 2016, we determined that we had misstated the prior service credit related to the postretirement plan amendment recognized in the third quarter 2015 financial statements. This misstatement had an impact on other comprehensive income/(losses) for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2016, we recorded  
  
   15 

a correction to reduce accrued postemployment costs by   $107 million  , reduce deferred income taxes by   $41 million  , and increase accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) by   $66 million   on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at October 2, 2016. This correction is reflected in prior service credits/(costs) arising during the period in the tables above. This misstatement was not material to our current or any prior period financial statements.    
  The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) in the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   were as follows (in millions): 

(a)  
    These components are included in the computation of net periodic postemployment benefit costs. See Note 8,   Postemployment Benefits  , for additional information. 
     In this note we have excluded activity and balances related to noncontrolling interest (which was primarily comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments) due to its insignificance. 
   
  Note 10.  Financial Instruments 
  See our consolidated financial statements and related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 2016 for additional information on our overall risk management strategies, our use of derivatives, and our related accounting policies. 
  Derivative Volume: 
  The notional values of our derivative instruments at   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016   were (in millions): 

16 

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments: 
  The fair values and the levels within the fair value hierarchy of derivative instruments recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016   were (in millions): 

Our derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. We elect to record the gross assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. If the derivative financial instruments had been netted on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by   $30 million   at   October 2, 2016   and   $44 million   at   January 3, 2016  . No material amounts of collateral were received or posted on our derivative assets and liabilities at   October 2, 2016  . 
  Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity future and options contracts and are valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
  Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist of commodity forwards, foreign exchange forwards, and cross-currency swaps. Commodity forwards are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Foreign exchange forwards are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Cross-currency swaps are valued based on observable market spot and swap rates. 
  Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. 
  There have been no transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 in any period presented. 
  
   17 

The fair values of our asset derivatives are recorded within other current assets and other assets. The fair values of our liability derivatives are recorded within other current liabilities and other liabilities. 
  Net Investment Hedging: 
  In May 2016, we issued    1.8 billion   aggregate principal amount of Euro denominated notes (see Note 12,   Commitments, Contingencies and Debt  ). The principal amounts of these foreign denominated notes were designated as net investment hedges. Concurrently, we fully unwound our then-outstanding Euro swap (USD notional amount of   $1.1 billion  ). At   October 2, 2016  , the principal amounts of foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges totaled    2,550 million   and    400 million  . 
  At   October 2, 2016  , our cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges consisted of: 

Hedge Coverage: 
  At   October 2, 2016  , we had entered into contracts designated as hedging instruments, which hedge transactions for the following durations: 
             
    foreign currency contracts for periods not exceeding the next   two   years, and 
                
    cross-currency contracts for periods not exceeding the next   four   years. 
     At   October 2, 2016  , we had entered into contracts not designated as hedging instruments, which hedge economic risks for the following durations: 
             
    commodity contracts for periods not exceeding the next   12   months, 
                
    foreign exchange contracts for periods not exceeding the next   12   months, and 
                
    cross-currency contracts for periods not exceeding the next   three   years. 
     Hedge Ineffectiveness: 
  We record pre-tax gains or losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(losses) due to ineffectiveness in: 
             
    other expense/(income), net for foreign exchange contracts related to forecasted transactions. 
     Deferred Hedging Gains and Losses: 
  Based on our valuation at   October 2, 2016   and assuming market rates remain constant through contract maturities, we expect transfers to net income/(loss) of unrealized gains for foreign currency cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be   $10 million  . Additionally, we expect transfers to net income/(loss) of unrealized losses for interest rate cash flow hedges during the next 12 months to be insignificant.

Derivative Impact on the Statements of Income and Statements of Comprehensive Income: 
  The following tables present the pre-tax effect of derivative instruments on the condensed consolidated statements of income and statements of comprehensive income for the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   (in millions):

Related to our non-derivative, foreign denominated debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, we recognized a pre-tax loss of   $15 million   for the three months and a pre-tax gain of   $24 million   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , and we recognized a pre-tax gain of   $22 million   for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2015. These amounts were recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) for the periods then ended. 
   
  Note 11.  Venezuela - Foreign Currency and Inflation 
  We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary and include these results in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our results of operations in Venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary. We continue to have sufficient currency liquidity and pricing flexibility to run our operations. However, the continuing economic uncertainty, strict labor laws, and evolving government controls over imports, prices, currency exchange and payments present a challenging operating environment. Increased restrictions imposed by the Venezuelan government or further deterioration of the economic environment could impact our ability to control our Venezuelan operations and could lead us to deconsolidate our Venezuelan subsidiary in the future. 
  At   October 2, 2016  , there were   two   exchange rates legally available to us for converting Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars, including:  
             
    the official exchange rate of BsF  10   per U.S. dollar available through the Sistema de Divisa Protegida ( DIPRO ), which is available for purchases and sales of essential items, including food products, and 
                
    an alternative exchange rate available through the Sistema de Divisa Complementaria ( DICOM ), which is available for all transactions not covered by DIPRO and is a free-floating exchange rate format. 
     
   20 

The DICOM rate (formerly SIMADI) averaged BsF  646   per U.S. dollar for the three months and BsF  441   per U.S. dollar for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , and was BsF  659   per U.S. dollar at   October 2, 2016  . During the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016, we have had access to U.S. dollars at DICOM rates. As of   October 2, 2016  , we believe that the DICOM rate is the most appropriate legally available rate at which to translate the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary. 
  We have had limited access to, and settlements at, the former official exchange rate of BsF  6.30   per U.S. dollar during the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   (as of March 10, 2016, the official exchange rate was devalued to BsF  10   per U.S. dollar). We have had no settlements at the current official exchange rate of BsF  10   per U.S. dollar during the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  . We had outstanding requests of   $26 million   at   October 2, 2016   for payment of invoices for the purchase of ingredients and packaging materials for the years 2012 through 2015, all of which were requested for payment at BsF  6.30   per U.S. dollar. 
  We remeasured the net monetary assets and operating results of our Venezuelan subsidiary, resulting in a nonmonetary currency devaluation gain of   $6 million   for the three months and loss of   $1 million   for the nine months ended   October 2, 2016  , which was recorded in other expense/(income), net, in the condensed consolidated statements of income for such periods. During the second quarter of 2016, the DICOM rate deteriorated significantly, from BsF  276   per U.S. dollar as of April 3, 2016 to BsF  628   per U.S. dollar as of July 3, 2016. Accordingly, as of July 3, 2016,   we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary for impairment, resulting in a   $53 million   loss to write down property, plant and equipment, net, and prepaid spare parts, which was recorded within cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statements of income for that period. 
  Prior to June 28, 2015, we used the official exchange rate of BsF  6.30   per U.S. dollar to translate the results of our Venezuelan subsidiary. In June 2015, due to the continued lack of liquidity and increasing economic uncertainty, we reevaluated the rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary. We determined that the DICOM rate was the most appropriate legally available rate. At June 28, 2015, we remeasured the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary at the then SIMADI rate of BsF  197.7   per U.S. dollar, resulting in a nonmonetary currency devaluation of   $234 million  , which was recorded in other expense/(income), net, in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary for impairment, which resulted in a   $49 million   loss to write down inventory to the lower of cost or market, which was recorded in cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the second quarter of 2015. 
   
  Note 12.  Commitments, Contingencies and Debt 
  Legal Proceedings 
  We are routinely involved in legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inquiries, inspections or investigations ( Legal Matters ) arising in the ordinary course of our business. 
  On April 1, 2015, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) filed a formal complaint against Mondel z International, Inc. ( Mondel z International ) and Kraft   in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division,   related to activities involving the trading of December 2011 wheat futures contracts.   The complaint alleges that Mondel z International and Kraft (1) manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 2011, (2) violated position limit levels for wheat futures, and (3) engaged in non-competitive trades by trading both sides of exchange-for-physical Chicago Board of Trade wheat contracts. As previously disclosed by Kraft, these activities arose prior to the October 1, 2012 spin-off of Kraft by Mondel z International to its shareholders and involve the business now owned and operated by Mondel z International or its affiliates.   The Separation and Distribution Agreement between Kraft and Mondel z International, dated as of September 27, 2012, governs the allocation of liabilities between Mondel z International and Kraft and, accordingly, Mondel z International will predominantly bear the costs of this matter and any monetary penalties or other payments that the CFTC may impose. We do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.    
  While we cannot predict with certainty the results of Legal Matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the Legal Matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
  Debt 
  Borrowing Arrangements: 
  On May 4, 2016, together with Kraft Heinz Foods Company, our wholly owned operating subsidiary, we entered into the first amendment (the  First Amendment ) to the credit agreement dated as of July 6, 2015   (the  Credit Agreement ) described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 3, 2016  . 
  
   21 

Among other things, the First Amendment (a) provided for a one time modification of the extension period of the Credit Agreement, (b) increased the letter of credit sublimit from   $150 million   to   $300 million  , and (c) expanded the available currencies in which revolving loans can be issued with the mutual consent of Kraft Heinz Foods Company and the applicable lender. In connection with the First Amendment, the maturity date of the revolving loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement was extended from July 6, 2020 to July 6, 2021. 
  The obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Kraft Heinz Foods Company in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower and by Kraft Heinz in the case of indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary borrower and Kraft Heinz Foods Company. The Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default that are typical for this type of facility. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, together with Kraft Heinz Foods Company, we commenced a commercial paper program.   As of October 2, 2016, we had   $639 million   of commercial paper outstanding,   which had a weighted average interest rate of   0.925%  . There was   no   commercial paper outstanding at January 3, 2016. 
  Debt Issuance: 
  The carrying value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, was   $32.0 billion   at October 2, 2016 and   $25.2 billion   at January 3, 2016.   The increase during the period was driven by new issuances of long-term debt during the second quarter of 2016  , as described below.    
    We used the net proceeds from the U.S. Dollar Notes and Euro Notes issuances primarily to redeem all outstanding shares of our   9.00%   cumulative compounding preferred stock, Series A ( Series A Preferred Stock ), for   $8.3 billion  . 
  The U.S. Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes were issued by Kraft Heinz Foods Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on a senior unsecured basis by Kraft Heinz. The U.S. Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes contain customary covenants and events of default. 
  We incurred debt issuance costs related to the sale of the U.S. Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes of   $52 million  , which is reflected as a direct deduction of our long-term debt balance on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at   October 2, 2016  .  
  Fair Value of Debt: 
  At   October 2, 2016  , the aggregate fair value of our total debt was   $35.6 billion  . We determined the fair value of our short-term debt using Level 1 quoted prices in active markets. We determined the fair value of our long-term debt using Level 2 inputs. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. 
  Series A Preferred Stock 
  As noted above, o  n June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our   Series A Preferred Stock  . We funded this redemption primarily through the issuance of the U.S. Dollar Notes and Euro Notes, as well as other sources of liquidity, including our commercial paper program, U.S. securitization program, and cash on hand.   In connection with the redemption, all Series A Preferred Stock was canceled and automatically retired. Additionally, on June 7, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Retirement of Series A Preferred Stock, which reduced the number of our preferred shares authorized by   80,000   to   920,000   and eliminated all references to the Series A Preferred Stock from our Certificate of Incorporation.    
  Financing Arrangements 
  In May 2016,     we amended our U.S. securitization program. Under the new terms, we receive cash consideration of up to     $800 million   and a receivable for the remainder of the purchase price (the  Deferred Purchase Price ).   This program expires in May 2017. There were no significant changes to our other accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs (the  Programs ) during the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  . See Note 15,   Financing Arrangements,   to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended   January 3, 2016     in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Programs. 
  
   22 

The cash consideration and carrying amount of receivables removed from the condensed consolidated balance sheets in connection with the Programs were   $902 million   at   October 2, 2016   and   $267 million   at   January 3, 2016  . The fair value of the Deferred Purchase Price for the Programs was   $208 million   at   October 2, 2016   and   $583 million   at   January 3, 2016  . The Deferred Purchase Price is included in sold receivables on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and had a carrying value which approximated its fair value at   October 2, 2016   and   January 3, 2016  . 
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest 
  In April 2016, the minority partner in our Brazilian subsidiary, Coniexpress S.A. Industrias Alimenticias ( Coniexpress ), exercised a put option that required us to purchase its   5%   equity interest in the subsidiary for   $21 million  . The redemption value was determined based on a specified formula within the shareholders  agreement between our Brazilian subsidiary and the minority partner. An adjustment was made to retained earnings to record the carrying value at the maximum redemption value immediately prior to this transaction. As this exercise did not result in a change in control of Coniexpress, it was accounted for as an equity transaction. We now own   100%   of Coniexpress. 
   
  Note 13.  Earnings Per Share 
  Our earnings per common share ( EPS ) for the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   and   September 27, 2015   were: 

We use the treasury stock method to calculate the dilutive effect of outstanding equity awards in the denominator for diluted earnings per common share. Due to the net loss attributable to common shareholders in the   three and nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  , the dilutive effects of equity awards and warrants were excluded because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share. Anti-dilutive shares were   1 million   for the three months and   3 million   for the nine months ended   October 2, 2016   and were   12 million   for the three months and   19 million   for the nine months ended   September 27, 2015  . 
   
  Note 14.  Segment Reporting 
  We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products, throughout the world. 
  We manage and report our operating results through     four   segments. We have   three     reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada, and Europe. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as  Rest of World . Rest of World is comprised of     three     operating segments: Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Russia, India, the Middle East and Africa ( RIMEA ). 
  In the third quarter of 2016, we announced our plans to move the businesses comprising our RIMEA operating segment into our other existing segments to align with our global growth strategy. These plans include (i) moving our Russia business into the Europe reportable segment and (ii) moving the remaining RIMEA businesses into our Asia Pacific operating segment. We expect that these changes will become effective December 31, 2016. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect to restate our Europe and Rest of World segments to reflect these changes.    
  
   23 

In the first quarter of 2016, we moved certain historical Kraft export businesses from our United States segment to our Rest of World and Europe segments to align with our long-term go-to-market strategies. We began to manage and report our results reflecting this change in the first quarter of 2016 and have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. The impact of this change is not material to current or prior period results.   This change did not impact our Integration Program and restructuring expenses disclosed by segment in Note 3,   Integration and Restructuring Expenses. 
  Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors including net sales and segment adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization ( Segment Adjusted EBITDA ). Management uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. These items include depreciation and amortization (including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), equity award compensation expense, integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment s operating results), impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation, and certain general corporate expenses. In addition, consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources, Segment Adjusted EBITDA includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013.   There are no pro forma adjustments to any of the numbers disclosed in this note to the condensed consolidated financial statements except for the Segment Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation. 
  Management does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or allocate resources. Therefore, we do not disclose assets by segment. 
  Our net sales by segment and Segment Adjusted EBITDA were:

In 2016, we reorganized the products within our product categories to reflect how we manage our business. We have reflected this change for all historical periods presented. Our net sales by product category were:

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
   
  Overview 
  Description of the Company:  
  We manufacture and market food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee, and other grocery products, throughout the world. 
  Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results 
  The 2015 Merger: 
  We completed the 2015 Merger on July 2, 2015. See Note 1,   Background and Basis of Presentation,   and Note 2,   Merger and Acquisition,   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Integration and Restructuring Expenses: 
  We recorded expenses of   $237 million   for the three months and   $781 million   for the   nine months   ended     October 2, 2016  ,   and   $482 million   for the three months and   $587 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 27, 2015  ,   related to the Integration Program and restructuring activities.     These expenses include our multi-year   $1.9 billion     Integration Program, which we announced following the 2015 Merger. The Integration Program costs primarily include organization costs, including cash and non-cash severance, footprint costs to exit facilities, and other costs incurred as a direct result of restructuring activities related to the 2015 Merger. Additionally, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion related to the Integration Program. As of October 2, 2016, we have recognized $581 million in capital expenditures since the inception of the Integration Program. The Integration Program is designed to reduce costs, integrate, and optimize our combined organization and is expected to achieve $1.5 billion of pre-tax savings by 2017, primarily benefiting the United States and Canada segments. We realized pre-tax savings of approximately $330 million during the three months and $865 million during the nine months ended October 2, 2016. Since the inception of the Integration Program, our cumulative savings achieved are approximately $990 million.   See Note 3,   Integration and Restructuring Expenses,   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
    
  Series A Preferred Stock: 
  On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock  . We funded this redemption primarily through the issuance of the U.S. Dollar Notes and Euro Notes, as well as other sources of liquidity, including our commercial paper program, U.S. securitization program, and cash on hand.  
   
  Results of Operations 
  Due to the size of Kraft s business relative to the size of Heinz s business prior to the 2015 Merger, and for purposes of comparability, the   Results of Operations   include certain unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information (the  pro forma financial information ) adjusted to assume that Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for the prior periods presented. This pro forma financial information reflects combined historical results, final purchase accounting adjustments, and adjustments to align accounting policies. There are no pro forma adjustments in the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016 as Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for the entire period. For more information see   Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information. 
  In addition, we include certain non-GAAP financial measures, which, for the prior year periods, are derived from these unaudited pro forma results. These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. For additional information, see   Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
  Summary of Results:   

  Net Sales: 

(a)    
    There are no pro forma adjustments for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2016, as Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for the entire period. See the   Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information   at the end of this item. 
               (b)     
    Organic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   section at the end of this item.    
     Three Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Three Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales increased   2.4%   to   $6.3 billion   for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the prior period, primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. 
  Pro forma net sales decreased   1.5%  , partially due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.5 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased   1.0%   due to lower pricing (0.7 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.3 pp). Lower pricing reflected deflation in key commodities (which we define as dairy, meat, coffee and nuts) in the United States, primarily in meats and coffee, and coffee in Canada, as well as higher promotional expenses in Europe. Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to lower shipments across several categories, particularly meats, foodservice, and nuts in the United States, which was partially offset by volume gains from innovation in refrigerated meal combinations and boxed dinners, as well as gains in coffee in the United States and condiments and sauces globally. 
  Nine Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales increased   75.0%   to   $19.6 billion   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the prior period, primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. 
  Pro forma net sales decreased   3.4%   primarily reflecting the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (3.1 pp) and divestitures (0.2 pp). Organic Net Sales were down   0.1%   due to unfavorable volume/mix (0.6 pp) that was mostly offset by higher pricing (0.5 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was due to lower shipments in meats, ready-to-drink beverages and foodservice in the United States, partially offset by growth in refrigerated meal combinations in the United States and condiments and sauces globally. Pricing was higher in Rest of World, Canada and United States despite deflation in key commodities in United States and Canada, primarily in dairy and coffee. 
  
   36 

Net Income: 

(a)     
    Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   section at the end of this item.    
     Three Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Three Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Operating income increased to   $1.4 billion   for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016  , compared to   $399 million   in the prior period. This increase was primarily driven by a non-cash purchase accounting adjustment for Kraft s inventory in the prior period, savings from our Integration Program and restructuring activities, lower Integration Program and restructuring expenses, and favorable pricing net of commodity costs in the current period, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. 
  Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders increased   $1.1 billion   to   $842 million   for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the prior period. The increase was due to the growth in operating income, the absence of a preferred dividend in the current period, lower interest expense, and lower other expense/(income), net, partially offset by higher taxes, all detailed as follows: 
             
    The Series A Preferred Stock was fully redeemed on June 7, 2016. Accordingly, for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016   there were no such cash distributions, compared to one $180 million cash distribution on our Series A Preferred Stock in the prior period.  
                
    Interest expense decreased to   $311 million   for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016  , compared to   $460 million   in the prior period. This decrease was primarily due to a $204 million write off of debt issuance costs in the prior period, partially offset by borrowings under our commercial paper program and the issuance of new long-term debt in conjunction with the redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock. See Note 12,   Commitments, Contingencies and Debt  , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
                
    Other expense/(income), net decreased to   $3 million   of income for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016  , compared to   $108 million   of expense in the prior period. The decrease was primarily due to call premiums of $105 million related to our 2015 refinancing activities in the prior period. 
                
    The effective tax rate was   23.7%   for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016  , compared to a   29.1%   benefit for the prior period.   Our current effective tax rate reflects the favorable benefit of non-U.S. jurisdictions with lower tax rates, the U.S. manufacturing deduction, as well as the deferred tax effect of statutory tax rate changes and adjustments.   The change in our effective tax rate   was driven by the 2015 Merger as well as the impact of tax law changes and deferred tax adjustments.     With the 2015 Merger, our operations in the United States and Canada increased, resulting in an unfavorable impact to the effective tax rate of higher blended statutory tax rates and a favorable impact to the effective tax rate of a larger U.S. manufacturing deduction. 
     Adjusted EBITDA increased   21.7%   to   $1.8 billion   for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the prior period, primarily driven by savings from our Integration Program and restructuring activities and favorable pricing net of commodity costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (0.8 pp).  
  Nine Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Operating Income increased to     $4.6 billion     for the     nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , compared to   $1.4 billion   in the prior period, primarily driven by the 2015 Merger, savings from our Integration Program and restructuring activities, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments for Kraft s inventory in the prior period, favorable pricing net of commodity costs, partially offset by higher Integration Program and restructuring expenses in the current period as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. 
  
   37 

Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders increased   $3.1 billion   to   $2.5 billion   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the prior period. The increase was due to the growth in operating income combined with lower interest expense, other expense/(income), net, and preferred dividend payments, partially offset by higher taxes, all detailed as follows: 
             
    Due to the December 8, 2015 common stock dividend declaration, we were required to accelerate payment of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend from March 7, 2016 to December 8, 2015. Accordingly, there were two cash distributions for Series A Preferred Stock during the three months ended January 3, 2016, and none during the three months ended April 3, 2016. The Series A Preferred Stock was fully redeemed on June 7, 2016. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we recorded our Series A Preferred Stock dividends as they were distributed. During the nine months ended   October 2, 2016  , we made one $180 million cash distribution on our Series A Preferred Stock. 
                
    Interest expense decreased to   $824 million   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , compared to   $1.1 billion   in the prior period. This decrease was primarily due to a $236 million write off of debt issuance costs related to 2015 refinancing activities and a $227 million loss released from other accumulated comprehensive income due to the early termination of certain interest rate swaps in the prior period as well as lower interest rates following our debt refinancing in connection with the 2015 Merger. These were partially offset by the assumption of $8.6 billion of Kraft s long-term debt obligations in the 2015 Merger, new borrowings under our commercial paper program, and the issuance of new long-term debt in conjunction with the redemption of our Series A Preferred Stock. See Note 12,   Commitments, Contingencies and Debt  , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
                
    Other expense/(income), net decreased to   $5 million   of income for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , compared to   $314 million   of expense in the prior period. The decrease was primarily due to a $234 million nonmonetary currency devaluation loss related to our Venezuelan operations in the prior period as well as call premiums of $105 million related to our 2015 refinancing activities in the prior period. 
                
    The effective tax rate was   27.9%   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  , compared to a   92.4%   benefit for the prior period.   Our current effective tax rate reflects the favorable benefit of non-U.S. jurisdictions with lower tax rates, the U.S. manufacturing deduction, as well as the deferred tax effect of statutory tax rate changes and adjustments.   The change in our effective tax rate   was driven by the 2015 Merger as well as the impact of tax law changes and deferred tax adjustments.     With the 2015 Merger, our operations in the United States and Canada increased, resulting in an unfavorable impact to the effective tax rate of higher blended statutory tax rates and a favorable impact to the effective tax rate of a larger U.S. manufacturing deduction. 
     Adjusted EBITDA increased   20.1%   to   $5.8 billion   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the prior period, primarily driven by savings from our Integration Program and restructuring activities and favorable pricing net of commodity costs, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (4.2 pp).  
  Diluted EPS: 

(a)     
    Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   section at the end of this item.  
     Three Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Three Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Diluted EPS increased to   $0.69   for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to a loss of   $0.27   for the prior period. The increase in diluted earnings/(loss) per share was driven primarily by the net income factors discussed above, partially offset by the effect of an increase in the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding compared to the prior year period. 
  
   38 

(a)     
    There are no pro forma adjustments in the three months ended October 2, 2016, as Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for the entire period. See the   Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information   at the end of this item. 
               (b)     
    Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   section at the end of this item.  
     Adjusted EPS increased   88.6%   to   $0.83   for the   three months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to   $0.44   for the prior period, primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA growth, lower preferred dividends and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. 
  Nine Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Diluted earnings/(loss) per share increased to   $2.05   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to a loss of   $0.87   for the prior period. The increase in diluted earnings/(loss) per share was driven primarily by the net income factors discussed above, partially offset by the effect of an increase in the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding following the 2015 Merger. 
  
   39 

(a)     
    There are no pro forma adjustments in the nine months ended October 2, 2016, as Kraft and Heinz were a combined company for the entire period. See the   Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information   at the end of this item. 
               (b)   
    For Adjusted EPS, we present the impact of the Series A Preferred Stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Accordingly, we include adjustments to EPS to include $180 million of Series A Preferred Stock dividends during the first quarter of 2016 (to reflect the March 7, 2016 Series A Preferred Stock dividend that was paid in December 2015) and to exclude $51 million of Series A Preferred Stock dividends during the second quarter of 2016 (to reflect that it was redeemed on June 7, 2016). 
               (c)     
    Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the   Non-GAAP Financial Measures   section at the end of this item.  
     Adjusted EPS increased   53.5%   to   $2.41   for the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016   compared to   $1.57   for the prior period, primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA growth and lower preferred dividends, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, lower other expense/(income), net, and higher interest expense. 
   
  Results of Operations by Segment 
  We manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada, and Europe. Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as  Rest of World . Rest of World is comprised of three operating segments: Asia Pacific, Latin America, and RIMEA.  
  In the third quarter of 2016, we announced planned changes to our segment structure. We expect that these changes will become effective December 31, 2016. For additional information on these changes, see Note 14,   Segment     Reporting  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements.    
  Management evaluates segment performance based on several factors including net sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment Adjusted EBITDA assists management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. These items include depreciation and amortization (including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), equity award compensation expense, integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment s operating results), impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation, and certain general corporate expenses. In addition, consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources, Segment Adjusted EBITDA includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013.

     Three Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Three Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales increased   4.5%   to   $4.4 billion  , primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. Pro forma net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased   1.2%  , due to lower pricing (0.7 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (0.5 pp). Lower pricing reflects deflation in key commodities, primarily in meats and coffee. Unfavorable volume/mix was due to lower shipments, particularly in meats, foodservice and nuts, which was partially offset by volume gains from innovation in refrigerated meal combinations and boxed dinners as well as gains in coffee. 
  Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased   30.6%   primarily due to savings from the Integration Program and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs, which were partially offset by volume/mix declines in meats and foodservice. 
  Nine Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales increased   131.9%   to   $13.8 billion  , primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. Pro forma net sales and Organic Net Sales decreased   1.0%   due to unfavorable volume/mix (1.2 pp) that was partially offset by higher pricing (0.2 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily due to lower shipments of meats, declines in ready-to-drink beverages, and lower shipments in foodservice that were partially offset by innovation-related gains in refrigerated meal combinations and gains in coffee. Pricing was neutral despite deflation in key commodities, primarily in dairy and coffee. 
  Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased   29.6%   primarily due to savings from the Integration Program and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs, partially offset by volume/mix declines across most categories.

     Three Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Three Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales, pro forma net sales, and Organic Net Sales increased   2.0%   to   $550 million   driven by favorable volume/mix (3.4 pp) that was partially offset by lower pricing (1.4 pp). Favorable volume/mix reflected gains in foodservice versus the prior year and shipment timing in boxed dinners and coffee. Lower pricing was primarily driven by deflation in key commodities, primarily in coffee. 
  Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased   34.5%  , including the favorable impact of foreign currency (1.8 pp). This increase was driven primarily by Integration Program savings and favorable volume/mix.

Nine Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales increased   110.4%   to   $1.7 billion  , primarily driven by the 2015 Merger. Pro forma net sales decreased by   3.5%   due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (5.0 pp). Organic Net Sales increased   1.5%   driven by higher pricing (1.9 pp) that was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix (0.4 pp). Price increases were driven by significant pricing actions taken to offset higher input costs in local currency, despite deflation in key commodities. Unfavorable volume/mix reflected the volume impact of reduced promotional activity in cheese versus the prior year, partially offset by higher shipments of condiments and sauces. 
  Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased   31.3%   despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (6.7 pp). This increase was driven primarily by Integration Program savings and favorable pricing net of key commodity costs.

     Three Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Three Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales and pro forma net sales decreased   14.5%   to   $513 million  , partially due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (6.7 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased   7.8%   due to unfavorable volume/mix (4.9 pp) and lower pricing (2.9 pp). Unfavorable volume/mix was due to shipment timing versus prior period as well as ongoing consumption weakness across several categories, primarily in the UK and Netherlands. Lower pricing was primarily due to higher promotional expenses versus the prior period. 
  Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased   17.9%   partially due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (8.5 pp). Excluding the currency impact, the Segment Adjusted EBITDA decline was primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix, lower pricing and increased marketing investments, partially offset by savings in manufacturing costs.  
  Nine Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales decreased   10.9%   to   $1.6 billion   reflecting the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency and divestitures. Pro forma net sales decreased   11.0%   partially due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency (4.2 pp) and divestitures (2.2 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased   4.6%   due to lower pricing (2.7 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (1.9 pp). Lower pricing was primarily due to increased promotional activity in beans and soup versus the prior period. Unfavorable volume/mix was due primarily to declines in soup and infant nutrition. 
  Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased   13.6%   partially due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (5.1 pp). Excluding the currency impact, the Segment Adjusted EBITDA decline was primarily due to lower pricing, unfavorable volume/mix as well as an increase in marketing investments, partially offset by savings in manufacturing costs.

     Three Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Three Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales and pro forma net sales increased   4.4%   to   $809 million  , reflecting the favorable impact of foreign currency (0.8 pp). Organic Net Sales increased   3.6%  , driven by higher pricing (1.9 pp) and favorable volume/mix (1.7 pp). Higher pricing was primarily driven by pricing actions to offset higher input costs in local currency, primarily in Latin America, partially offset by higher promotional spending. Favorable volume/mix was primarily driven by growth in condiments and sauces across all regions. 
  Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased   1.3%   despite the favorable impact of foreign currency (2.6 pp). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA declined due to higher input costs in local currency and increased marketing investments, which were partially offset by sales growth. 
  Nine Months   Ended   October 2, 2016   compared to the   Nine Months   Ended   September 27, 2015  : 
  Net sales decreased   4.6%   to   $2.5 billion   reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, which was partially offset by the inclusion of the Kraft business in the current period. Pro forma net sales decreased   10.5%   due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (17.6 pp, including a 13.0 pp impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar). Organic Net Sales increased   7.1%  , driven by favorable volume/mix (4.0 pp) and higher pricing (3.1 pp). Favorable volume/mix was driven by growth in condiments and sauces across all regions. Higher pricing was driven primarily by pricing actions to offset higher input costs in local currency in Latin America. 
  Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased   7.9%   primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (24.0 pp, including a 19.5 pp impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar). Excluding the currency impact, Segment Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily driven by organic sales growth that was partially offset by increased marketing investments. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We believe that cash generated from our operating activities, our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), our securitization programs, and our commercial paper program will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, expected Integration Program and restructuring expenditures, planned capital expenditures, contributions to our postemployment benefit plans, future contractual obligations, and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends. We intend to use our cash on hand and our commercial paper program for daily funding requirements. Overall, we do not expect any negative effects on our funding sources that would have a material effect on our short-term or long-term liquidity. 
  Net Cash Provided by/Used for Operating Activities: 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $2.9 billion     in the nine months ended     October 2, 2016   compared to   $746 million     in the nine months ended     September 27, 2015  . The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating income as a result of the 2015 Merger, which was partially offset by increased cash expenditures related to the Integration Program and restructuring activities and increased pension contributions. See Note 8,   Postemployment Benefits  , for further discussion of our pension contributions, including the amount that we expect to pay in the current year.  
  
   45 

Changes in current assets and liabilities were unfavorable in the nine months ended October 2, 2016, driven by unfavorable changes in inventories and other current liabilities. The change in inventories was driven by an increase in inventory production ahead of planned facility closures and consolidations under our Integration Program. The change in other current liabilities was primarily driven by increased payments in the nine months ended October 2, 2016 related to income taxes and accrued liabilities, primarily accrued restructuring costs related to our Integration Program and restructuring activities. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable. The favorable change in accounts payable was primarily driven by payment term extensions from vendor renegotiations. The change in accounts receivable was favorable as a result of increasing our U.S. securitization program. 
  Net Cash Provided by/Used for Investing Activities: 
  Net cash used for investing activities was $  742 million     in the nine months ended     October 2, 2016   compared to   $9.4 billion     in the nine months ended     September 27, 2015  . The decrease in cash used for investing activities was driven by payments of $9.5 billion to acquire Kraft Foods Group, Inc. in connection with the 2015 Merger. The decrease in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures, which was primarily due to integration and restructuring activities in the United States during the nine months ended   October 2, 2016  . We expect 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion, including capital expenditures required for our ongoing integration and restructuring activities. The decrease in cash used for investing activities was also driven by lower cash settlements of net investment hedges   in the nine months ended     October 2, 2016   than   in the nine months ended     September 27, 2015  . 
  Net Cash Provided by/Used for Financing Activities: 
  Net cash used for financing activities was   $3.0 billion     in the nine months ended     October 2, 2016   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of   $11.2 billion     in the nine months ended     September 27, 2015  . This decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by $10.0 billion of proceeds from our issuance of common stock to the Sponsors in connection with the 2015 Merger, the Series A Preferred Stock redemption in June 2016, and increased cash distributions related to our quarterly common stock dividend, which commenced during the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds from our May 2016 issuance of U.S. Dollar Notes and Euro Notes and net proceeds from our issuance of commercial paper, which were our primary sources of funding for the Series A Preferred Stock redemption. Additionally, in the prior year we had a benefit from proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, which were largely offset by repayments of long-term debt. Our cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended   October 2, 2016   also reflected the positive impact of no cash distribution related to our Series A Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2016. See   Equity and Dividends   for further information on cash distributions related to our Series A Preferred Stock. 
    
  Cash Held by International Subsidiaries: 
  At   October 2, 2016  , approximately $1.6 billion of cash and short-term investments were held by international subsidiaries.  
  We have provided for a deferred tax liability of $22 million for undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested.   
  We consider the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the United States to be indefinitely reinvested. For those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested, our intent is to reinvest these earnings in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our United States cash requirements. If we decide at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the United States, we would be required to pay taxes on these amounts based on the applicable United States tax rates net of credits for foreign taxes already paid. 
  Further, certain previously taxed earnings have not yet been remitted and certain intercompany loans have not been repaid. As a result, in future periods, we believe that we could remit approximately $3.7 billion of cash to the United States without incurring any additional material tax expense.  
  Total Debt: 
  During the second quarter of 2016, together with Kraft Heinz Foods Company, we commenced a commercial paper program.   As of October 2, 2016, we had   $639 million   of commercial paper outstanding,   which had a weighted average interest rate of   0.925%  . There was   no   commercial paper outstanding at January 3, 2016. 
  We maintain our Senior Credit Facilities comprised of our $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and a $600 million Term Loan Facility (together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the  Senior Credit Facilities ). Subject to certain conditions, we may increase the amount of revolving commitments and/or add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion. Our Senior Credit Facilities contain customary representations, covenants, and events of default. At   October 2, 2016  , $600 million aggregate principal amount of our Term Loan Facility was outstanding. No amounts were drawn on our Revolving Credit Facility at   October 2, 2016   or during the   nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  . Effective May 4, 2016, we amended the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 12,   Commitments, Contingencies and Debt  , for  
  
   46 

additional information on the amendment. See our consolidated financial statements and related notes on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 2016, for additional information on our Senior Credit Facilities, including covenant information related to our Revolving Credit Facility, interest rates on borrowings, maturity dates, and other general terms. 
  Our long-term debt, including the current portion, was   $32.0 billion   at   October 2, 2016   and   $25.2 billion   at January 3, 2016.   The increase during the period was driven by new issuances of long-term debt during the second quarter of 2016  . See Note 12,   Commitments, Contingencies and Debt  , for additional details related to this long-term debt issuance. Our long-term debt contains customary representations, covenants, and events of default. We were in compliance with all covenants as of   October 2, 2016  . 
   
  Commodity Trends 
  We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including dairy products, meat products, coffee beans, nuts, tomatoes, potatoes, soybean and vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners, corn products, and wheat to manufacture our products. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of resins, metals, and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities. 
  Markets for our key commodities were volatile during the   three and nine months   ended   October 2, 2016  . We expect commodity cost volatility to continue over the remainder of the year. We manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies. As a result of these risk management strategies, our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: 
  During the second quarter of 2016,   we amended our U.S. securitization program. Under the new terms, we receive cash consideration of up to     $800 million   and a receivable for the remainder of the Deferred Purchase Price. See Note 12,   Commitments, Contingencies and Debt  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  There were no other material changes to our off-balance sheet arrangements from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 3, 2016  . 
  Aggregate Contractual Obligations: 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we issued long-term debt, and as a result, our long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to   $32.0 billion   at   October 2, 2016   as compared to   $25.2 billion   at January 3, 2016. See Note 12,   Commitments, Contingencies and Debt  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and as a result, we will not make any further Series A Preferred Stock dividend payments. See Note 12,   Commitments, Contingencies and Debt  , to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
  There were no other material changes to our aggregate contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   January 3, 2016  . 
   
  Equity and Dividends 
  Common Stock Dividends: 
  We paid common stock dividends of   $2.1 billion     in the nine months ended     October 2, 2016   and   $637 million     in the nine months ended     September 27, 2015  .  
    
  On May 4, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.575 per share of common stock, which was paid on July 8, 2016, to shareholders of record on May 27, 2016. On August 4, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.60 per share of common stock, which was paid on October 7, 2016 to shareholders of record on August 26, 2016. We accrued dividends payable related to this dividend as of   October 2, 2016  . 
  Additionally, on November 3, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.60 per share of common stock, which is payable on December 16, 2016 to shareholders of record on December 2, 2016. The present annualized dividend rate is $2.40 per share of common stock.  
  The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.  
  
   47 

Series A Preferred Stock: 
  On June 7, 2016, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Following the redemption, we will not pay any future dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock.  
  We   made cash distributions of   $180 million     in the nine months ended     October 2, 2016     compared to   $540 million     in the nine months ended     September 27, 2015  .   The decrease in Series A Preferred Stock dividends occurred because, concurrent with the declaration of our common stock dividend on December 8, 2015, we also declared and paid the Series A Preferred Stock dividend that would otherwise have been payable on March 7, 2016. Accordingly, there were no cash distributions related to our Series A Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, as the Series A Preferred Stock was redeemed on June 7, 2016, there were no cash distributions in the third quarter of 2016.    
   
  Significant Accounting Estimates 
  We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1,   Background and Basis of Presentation,   to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended   January 3, 2016   in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our significant accounting assumptions and estimates are described in our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the year ended   January 3, 2016   in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
  We changed the method that we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension cost/(benefit) and net postretirement cost/(benefit). We use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The new method will result in a decrease in service cost and interest cost compared to what our costs would have been under the previous method. This change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

  Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information 
  The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the 2015 Merger, which was consummated on July 2, 2015, and the related equity investments, based on the historical results of operations of Heinz and Kraft. See Note 1,   Background and Basis of Presentation,   and Note 2,   Merger and Acquisition,   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 Merger. 
  The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the   three and nine months   ended   September 27, 2015   are based on the historical financial statements of Heinz and Kraft after giving effect to the 2015 Merger, related equity investments, and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income. 
  The Heinz statements of income information for the   three and nine months   ended   September 27, 2015   was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The Kraft statement of income information for the six months ended June 27, 2015 was derived from its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 7, 2016 and information for the period from June 27, 2015 to July 2, 2015 derived from Kraft s books and records. 
  
   48 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are presented as if the 2015 Merger had been consummated on December 30, 2013, the first business day of our 2014 fiscal year, and combine the historical results of Heinz and Kraft. This is consistent with internal management reporting. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income set forth below primarily give effect to the following assumptions and adjustments: 
             
     Application of the acquisition method of accounting; 
                
    The issuance of Heinz common stock to the Sponsors in connection with the equity investments; 
                
    The pre-closing Heinz share conversion; 
                
    The exchange of one share of Kraft Heinz common stock for each share of Kraft common stock; and  
                
    Conformance of accounting policies. 
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition.   We utilized estimated fair values at the 2015 Merger Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such allocation was final as of July 3, 2016. 
  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Article 11 and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results. In addition, the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do not reflect any additional anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings, or any integration costs that may result from the 2015 Merger. 
  The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the transaction, (2) factually supportable and (3) are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company. As a result, under SEC Regulation S-X Article 11, certain expenses such as deal costs and Inventory Step-up Costs, if applicable, are eliminated from pro forma results in the periods presented. In contrast, under the ASC 805 presentation in Note 2,   Merger and Acquisition,   to the condensed consolidated financial statements, these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results. 
  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, including the related notes, should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of Kraft, and with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The historical SEC filings of Kraft are available to the public at the SEC s website at www.sec.gov.

The Kraft Heinz Company  
   Summary of Pro Forma Adjustments 
  (in millions)  
  (Unaudited)    

  Adjustments included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are as follows: 
           (a)  
    Represents the change to align Kraft's accounting policy to our accounting policy for postemployment benefit plans. Kraft historically elected a mark-to-market accounting policy and recognized net actuarial gains or losses and changes in the fair value of plan assets immediately in earnings upon remeasurement. Our policy is to initially record such items in other comprehensive income/(loss). Also represents the elimination of Kraft s historical amortization of postemployment benefit plan prior service credits. 
              (b) 
    Represents the elimination of nonrecurring non-cash costs related to the fair value adjustment of Kraft s inventory. See our consolidated financial statements and related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 2016, for additional information on the determination of fair values. 
              (c)  
    Represents incremental amortization resulting from the fair value adjustment of Kraft s definite-lived intangible assets in connection with the 2015 Merger. The net change in depreciation expense resulting from the fair value adjustment of property, plant, and equipment was insignificant. See our consolidated financial statements and related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 2016, for additional information on the determination of fair values. 
              (d)  
    Represents the incremental compensation expense due to the fair value remeasurement of certain of Kraft s equity awards in connection with the 2015 Merger. See our consolidated financial statements and related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 3, 2016, for additional information on the conversion of Kraft s equity awards in connection with the 2015 Merger. 
              (e)  
    Represents the elimination of non-recurring deal costs incurred in connection with the 2015 Merger. 
              (f)  
    Represents the incremental change in interest expense resulting from the fair value adjustment of Kraft s long-term debt in connection with the 2015 Merger, including the elimination of the historical amortization of deferred financing fees and amortization of original issuance discount. 
     We calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 38.5% weighted average statutory tax rate for the periods presented. 
  Additionally, we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding Heinz s historical weighted average number of basic shares outstanding, the 500 million shares issued to the Sponsors in connection with their equity investments (after giving effect to the pre-closing Heinz conversion ratio of 0.443332) and the historical weighted average number of basic shares of Kraft, which were converted on a 1:1 basis into shares of Kraft Heinz. We calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the effect of dilutive securities to the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding, including dilutive securities of historical Heinz.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Our non-GAAP financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
  To supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per share, or other measures prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.  
  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management believes that presenting our non-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. 
  Organic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of acquisitions, currency, divestitures, and a 53   rd    week of shipments. We calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year s exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela following our June 28, 2015 currency devaluation, for which we calculate the previous year s results using the current year s exchange rate. Organic Net Sales for any period prior to the 2015 Merger Date includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. 
  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, provision for/(benefit from) income taxes; in addition to these adjustments, we exclude, when they occur, the impacts of depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses) (including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits), integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges,  impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation, and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). Adjusted EBITDA for any period prior to the 2015 Merger Date includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. Adjusted EBITDA is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations.  
  Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, and nonmonetary currency devaluation, and including when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. Adjusted EPS for any period prior to the 2015 Merger Date includes the operating results of Kraft on a pro forma basis, as if Kraft had been acquired as of December 30, 2013. We believe Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.
