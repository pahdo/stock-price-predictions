FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

Some
of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be  forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements
are not historical facts but include, but are not limited to, statements that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies,
predictions or any other statements relating to our future activities or other future events or conditions. These statements are
based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business based, in part, on assumptions made by management.
These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult
to predict.   

Forward-looking
statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as  estimates,   projects,   plans, 
 believes,   expects,   anticipates,   intends,  or the negative or other variations,
or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. We urge you to be cautious of the forward-looking statements
which are contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because they reflect our current beliefs with respect to future events
and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors affecting our operations, market growth, services, products
and licenses. No assurances can be given regarding the achievement of future results, as actual results may differ materially
as a result of the risks we face, and actual events may differ from the assumptions underlying the statements that have been made
regarding anticipated events.   

All
written and oral forward-looking statements made in connection with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are attributable to
us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Any forward looking
statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking
statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Given the uncertainties that
surround such statements, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

2.       SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Effective
January 27, 2016, the Company changed its fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31 and filed an unaudited transitional
report on Form 10-QT to cover the period from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on April 11, 2016. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and these notes should be read in conjunction with
the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2015 (the  Annual Report ). The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2015 is unaudited and
was derived from the Company s Form 10-QT and does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for audited financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain information and footnote disclosures, including critical and significant
accounting policies, normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted.
Results of operations and cash flows for interim periods presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
are not necessarily indicative of results of operations and cash flows for the full fiscal year.  

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

On
January 5, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Changes
to the current GAAP model primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value
option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related
to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale
debt securities. The classification and measurement guidance will be effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating how the adoption of this standard will
impact its consolidated financial statements.

   (unaudited)   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ( ASU 2016-02  Topic 842). The core change with ASU 2016-02 is
the requirement for the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating
leases under previous GAAP. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of ASU
2016-02 will have on its financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  or ASU 2016-09,
which amends ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation.  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 31, 2016, and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
how the adoption of this standard will impact its consolidated financial statements.  

On
June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments  (ASU 2016-13 ). This ASU modifies the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology
in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in the more timely recognition of losses. ASU 2016-13
will be effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The Company is currently reviewing the effect of ASU 2016-13.  

On
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230  ASU 2016-15 ) . ASU 2016-15
amends ASC 230 to add or clarify guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash
flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted. The updated guidance requires a retrospective transition method to each period presented.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on its statements of consolidated operations and
cash flows.  

Liquidity
 - The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a
going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $16 million. In addition, the Company has working capital
deficiencies of $2.6 million and $3.6 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company recently
closed on an equity raise thru a private placement, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $1.5 million as of September 30,
2016. Management plans to continue to raise additional funds through the sales of debt or equity securities until such time its
operations will begin to produce a positive cash flow. However, there is no assurance that additional financing will be available
when needed or that management will be able to obtain and close financing transactions on terms acceptable to the Company or whether
the Company will become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional
funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables and reduce overhead until sufficient additional
capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful. As of September
30, 2016, the Company has a backlog of approximately $32,500,000 of future orders to be fulfilled in the next twelve months.

2.       SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued   

Reclassifications
 - Certain prior period balances have been reclassified in order to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications
have no effect on previously reported results of operations or loss per share.  

Use
of Estimates  - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information that is currently available
to the Company and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. The Company s most significant estimates relate to its allowances for receivables, taxes
and equity issuances.  

Revenue
and Cost of Goods Sold Recognition  - Generally, for the staffing business, revenue is recognized when all of the following
criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
(3) the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  

Due
to the short term nature of the Company s construction contracts, revenue is recognized once 100% of a contract segment
is completed. A contract may have many segments, of which, once a segment is completed, the revenue for the segment is recognized
when no further significant performance obligations exists. The Company s construction contracts or segments of contracts
typically range from several days to two to four months. Contract costs may be billed as incurred. Contract costs include all
direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools
and repairs. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. The Company begins recognizing revenue
on a project as project costs are incurred and revenue recognition criteria are met.  As expenses are incurred on a project
but the invoicing criteria are not met, but the work has been accepted by the customer, revenue is recognized in that period and
recognized in accounts receivable as unbilled revenue. Such amount approximated $5 million and $1 million at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period such losses are known.
Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions,
changes in raw material costs, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to revenue, costs and income and are recognized
in the period in which the revisions are determined. 

Basic
and Diluted Loss Per Share -  The basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss (the numerator) by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period (the denominator). Diluted net loss per common share is computed by
dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares outstanding (if dilutive) during
each period. Potential common shares include convertible debt, warrants an d preferred stock. The number of potential common shares
outstanding relating to convertible debt, warrants and preferred stock is computed using the treasury stock method. For the periods
presented, potential dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss
per common share. Comparative data for the previous period has been adjusted to reflect the 1 for 20 reverse split effectuated
May 26, 2016.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued   

The
following securities are excluded from the calculation of weighted average dilutive common shares because they are not currently
convertible, or because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:  

[1]   
      The
    Series D and Series F preferred shares are convertible at a rate of 400 pre-split shares of common stock for each share of
    preferred stock but not until the Company has effected a sufficient increase in the authorized common shares. The Series D
    and Series F preferred shares were mandatorily converted to common shares at a ratio of 1 to 20 when the reverse split of
    common shares was effectuated on May 26, 2016.   

Concentration
of Credit Risk  - Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash at one financial institution that management believes
is a high-credit, high-quality financial institution and accordingly, subject to minimal credit risk. Deposits held with these
financial institutions may be in excess of the amount of insured limits provided on such deposits, if any. The Company is subject
to risk of nonpayment of its trade accounts receivable.  

The
Company s customer base is highly concentrated. As of December 31, 2015, the Company s three largest customers, Customer
E, Customer H and Customer B, represented 47%, 14%, and 10% of accounts receivable, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company s four largest customers, innovative communications service providers, Customer M, Customer E, Customer N and Customer
J represented 34%, 13%, 12%, and 11% of accounts receivable, respectively.  

Revenue
may significantly decline if the Company were to lose one or more of its significant customers. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, Customer E represented approximately 51% and 47% of revenues respectively, and customer B represented
approximately 8% and 23% respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company generated revenue
by four major customers, Customer M, represented approximately 49% and 33% of revenues respectively Customer J, represented approximately
8% and 19% of revenues respectively, Customer N, represented approximately 16% and 13% of revenues respectively, and Customer
L representing 6% and 10% of revenues, respectively.  

Amortization
of Senior Note Debt Discount and Deferred Financing Costs  - The amortization of the senior note debt discount (Note 7. Senior
Debt) is calculated monthly using the straight line method, which approximates the interest rate method, over the original term
of the note, twenty-four months, using the straight-line method which approximates the interest rate method. The result of this
monthly amortization is recognized in amortization of debt discount in the period amortized for the debt discount and interest
expense for the deferred finance costs.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued   

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments -  The Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) standard
related to fair value measurement at inception. The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or
permit fair value measurements and, accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard clarifies that
fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined
based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The recorded values of long-term debt
approximate their fair values, as interest approximates market rates. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the standard
established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  

Level
1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;  

Level
2: Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and  

Level
3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.  

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, leasehold improvements,
property and equipment, deposits, other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, capital leases, equity-linked
warrants, and notes payable. The recorded values of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable
approximate fair values due to the short maturities of such instruments. Recorded values for notes payable and related liabilities
approximate fair values, since their amortization of deferred financing cost stated or imputed interest rates are commensurate
with prevailing market rates for similar obligations.  

3.
RESTRICTED CASH ACCOUNT   

The
restricted cash account was created to deposit the unused proceeds from the Company s new senior debt (Note 7. Senior Debt).

SENIOR DEBT   

On
October 28, 2015, the Company, through its main operating entity Jus-Com, Inc. entered into an $8 million dollar senior credit
facility. The facility has a two year term, and calls for interest payments in the amount of 12%, paid quarterly in arrears. Additionally,
there is a  payment in kind  (PIK) provision which calls for a 4% per annum increase in the principal balance monthly.
The facility is a senior credit facility, and is secured by principally all assets of the Company. The uses of the senior facility
were to retire the existing senior debt and related accrued interest through a tender offer, retire the factoring line of credit,
pay certain senior loan closing costs, settle certain pending litigation, and provide working capital to the Company. A  blocked 
bank deposit account, controlled by the lender, was also initially established in the amount of $3,000,000 to be held for future
advances. (See restricted cash, note 3). The Company is prohibited from an early payoff of the facility until October 28, 2017.
There are several affirmative and negative covenants the Company must comply with, such as minimum bank account balances, minimum
EDITDA thresholds, capital expenditures, leverage ratio, and debt service coverage ratio. As a condition of the facility, the
Company issued 163,441 shares of its Series D preferred stock and 391,903 shares of its Series F preferred stock to the lender.
As a result of a market valuation performed on this transaction by a qualified third party valuation firm, an original issue discount
of $437,380 was determined, which will be amortized on a straight line method, which approximates the interest rate method, over
a twenty four month period to interest expense. During the period ended September 30, 2016, $164,018 was included in amortization
of debt discount, and $236,914 remained unamortized as of September 30, 2016. On April 5, 2016 the Company entered into an amendment
agreement to its existing credit facility with Lateral, amending the original credit agreement signed October 28, 2015. The agreement
amends select provisions of the original credit agreement, including equity raises and changes to certain financial and operational
covenants. On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a second amendment agreement to its existing credit facility, amending
the original credit agreement signed October 28, 2015. The agreement was amended solely to consolidate a series of short term
bridge loans granted to the Company from time to time during the second and third quarter of 2016 into a $2.5 million loan, which
matures on April 30, 2017. The second amendment also amended the covenants related to consolidated EBITDA, consolidated leverage,
consolidated debt service, SG A expenses, and compensation expense. The Company is in compliance with its covenants as of
September 30, 2016.

TERM LOAN   

On
September 30, 2016, the Company and its senior lender modified certain bridge loans entered into from June 2016 through September
2016. The various bridge loans with an outstanding balance of $2.25 million were restructured into one term loan for $2.5 million,
with a maturity date of April 30, 2017 and an interest rate of 16% per year. Consideration was then made whether the terms of
the restructured debt instrument were substantially different from the original debt instrument. Under ASC 470-50 Modifications
and Extinguishment if the present value of the cash flows under the new debt is at least 10% different from the present value
of the remaining cash flows under the original debt, they are considered to be substantially different and extinguishment accounting
is applied. Based on the calculations performed, there was a greater than 10% difference between the present value of cash flows
under the restructured debt compared to the present value of the remaining cash flows under the original debt. Therefore, the
restructuring met the conditions for debt extinguishment accounting under ASC 470-50. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value
of this debt was determined to be $2,560,700, and is recorded as such in Section 6, Notes Payable. The difference in the face
value of the note and the fair value of the note, $60,700 was recorded as a one time extinguishment expense in this period, along
with $110,000 of fees paid to the lender and $143,200 to establish the warrant liability, for a total one time extinguishment
expense of $313,900. See Footnote 10  Warrants and Derivative Warrant Liability  for the fair value calculation of
the warrant issued in conjunction with this term loan. As of September 30, 2016 there are $473,100 in deferred financing costs
associated with the term loan, which will be amortized on a straight line method, which approximates the interest rate method,
over a seven month period to interest expense.

Legal
Matters - The Company is involved in litigation claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal fees and other costs
associated with such actions are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company assesses, in conjunction with its legal counsel,
the need to record a liability for litigation and contingencies. The Company reserves for costs relating to these matters when
a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. There have been no material developments in any legal proceedings
since the disclosures contained in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2015, at which time the Company
provided for an accrual of $1,840,891 to settle these claims. On November 20, 2015, the Company settled the Martin and Arey lawsuit
for $150,000 cash, a promissory note for $250,000, and 512,820 share of common stock, having a value of $5,120. On November 24,
2015, the Company settled the Daniel Fournier lawsuit for $100,000 in cash. On December 14, 2015, the Company settled the RoadSafe

STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   

Stock
To Be Issued   

On September 29, 2016, the Company
closed on its second round of an equity raise thru its investment banker. The transaction, which resulted in proceeds to the Company
of $848,138 (gross proceeds of $969,475 less transaction fees of $121,337) called for the issuance of 2,423,687 shares of common
stock on the closing date. Since the transfer agent did not issue the shares until October 12, 2016, these shares, as of September
30, 2016, were classified as common shares to be issued in stockholder s equity. As of December 31, 2015, there were no
shares classified as common shares to be issued.

Warrants
and Derivative Warrant Liability   

The
Company accounts for common stock warrants as either equity instruments or derivative liabilities depending on the specific terms
of the warrant agreement. Stock warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities if the warrants allow for cash settlement
or provide for modification of the warrant exercise price in the event subsequent sales of common stock by the Company are at
a lower price per share than the then-current warrant exercise price. We classify derivative warrant liabilities on the balance
sheet at fair value, and changes in fair value during the periods presented in the statement of operations, which is revalued
at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance of the stock warrant. As of September 30, 2016, the following warrants
are outstanding:  

(1)  
      Warrant
    was determined to be a derivative subject to fair value accounting and is booked as a warrant liability.

STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY, continued   

The
Company has assessed its outstanding equity-linked financial instruments issued with the term loan cited in Footnote 8 and has
concluded that the warrants are subject to derivative accounting as a result of certain anti-dilution provisions contained in
the warrants. The fair value of these warrants is classified as a liability in the financial statements, with the change in fair
value during the future periods being recorded in the statement of operations.  

The
following table summarizes the calculated aggregate fair values for the warrant derivative liability using the Lattice Model method
based on the following assumptions:  

These
warrants are Level 3 valuation which were issued and measured on September 30, 2016.  

Subscription
Receivable   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company issued 2,229,000 shares of common stock to employees that were subject to
certain vesting requirements. As of September 30, 2016 , 2,100,000 shares of such shares that with a grant date value of
$1,357,800 remain unvested. Because these common shares are subject to forfeiture if the employees are no longer employed with
the Company at the end of their employment agreements, their unvested value is carried in subscriptions receivable within stockholder s
equity. 

Equity
Transactions    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 285,664 shares of its of its Preferred Series F stock with a grant

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 231,041 shares of its of its Preferred Series F stock to its independent
directors and two officers with a grant date value of $152,487 for compensation.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, continued   

Temporary
Equity   

In
conjunction with the Lateral senior credit agreement dated October 28, 2015, the Company also entered into a Redemption Rights
Agreement ( agreement ). Contained in this agreement is a put provision related to the preferred shares of stock issued
as a condition of the transaction. The Redemption Rights may be exercised at any time on or after October 28, 2017, provided the
following conditions are met:  

(i)
The Company s market capitalization on such date is equal to greater than $25,000,000, or (ii) the last twelve months earnings
before interest, taxes depreciation, and amortization ending on the last day of the month preceding such date is greater than
$3,000,000.  

Further,
the Redemption Rights are barred from being exercised if the exercise of such Redemption Rights would, in good faith, prevent
the Company from continuing as a going concern.  

The
Redeemable Shares are redeemable at the per share price implied by 10 multiplied by the Company s LTM EBITDA, multiplied
by the Ownership Percentage, divided by the number of Redeemable shares then held.  

An
analysis was performed, under ASC 480-10-25-7 to determine if the redeemable shares should be classified as debt or equity. The
results of this analysis determined the redeemable shares did not fall under the definition of mandatorily redeemable financial
instruments and therefore should not be classified as debt.  

Pursuant
to ASC 480-10-S99, preferred stock redeemable for cash or other assets are to be classified outside of permanent equity if it
is redeemable with any one of the following characteristics:  

At
    a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date,   

At
    the option of the shareholder, or   

Upon
    the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the reporting entity.   

The
Redeemable Shares are redeemable upon the occurrence of certain events that are not solely within the control of the reporting
entity. In the natural course of pursuing the fulfillment of its required fiduciary duties, the Company may meet the conditions
upon which the shares would become redeemable (i.e. market capitalization and/or EBITDA, along with going concern status), and
would be thus unable to control the events leading to redemption. As a result of the evaluation, the Company has concluded that
the Redeemable Shares are appropriately classified outside of permanent equity as temporary equity.  

The
Redeemable Shares originally issued with the transaction, 163,441 of Series D Preferred Convertible shares and 391,903 of Series
F Preferred Convertible shares, were converted to 11,106,880 shares of the Company s Common Stock on or around May 26, 2016.
The conversion was completed due to the mandatory conversion feature of the preferred shares due to the reverse split of the Company s
Common Stock on May 26, 2016.  

Reverse
Split   

On
December 23, 2015, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to effect a reverse
stock split of our Common Stock at a 1-for-20 ratio (the  Reverse Split ) and increase our common shares authorized
to 200,000,000. On December 30, 2015, stockholders holding a majority of our voting power approved by written consent the amendment
to our Articles of Incorporation, which would affect the Reverse Split. The Reverse Split will reduce the number of outstanding
shares of our Common Stock by reclassifying and converting all outstanding shares of our Common Stock into a proportionately fewer
number of shares of Common Stock. The reverse stock was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA )
on May 25, 2016 and effectuated on May 26, 2016. In conjunction with the Reverse Split approval, all of the Series D and Series
F preferred convertible shares mandatorily converted to common shares at a 1-for-20 ratio.

Critical
Accounting Policies   

There
are no material changes from the critical accounting policies set forth in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  set forth in our Annual Report 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange

Segment
Reporting   

We
operate in the telecommunications infrastructure services industry and the staffing industry. The following table summarizes financial
information regarding our business segments during three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  

Discussion
of Operation Results for the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Overview   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we reported consolidated net losses attributable to common shareholders
of $1,051,878 and $1,564,140, reflecting a decrease in net losses of $512,262 or 33%. A decrease in operating loss for the three
month period from September 30, 2015 to 2016, respectively, of $1,581,894 was offset primarily by an increase of $138,416 in occupancy
costs.  

We
reported consolidated net losses attributable to common shareholders of $3,249,742 and $3,834,241 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting a decrease in net losses of $584,499 or 15%. An increase in gross profit
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of $1,344,186 or 64% was offset primarily by a same period increase of $111,340
in compensation expense, $395,804 in occupancy expense, $407,475 in interest expense, $313,900 in a one time expense due to fair
value analysis of our term loan, and $327,945 of amortization expense of debt discount.  

Revenues
and Gross Profit   

We
had overall revenues of $3,827,853 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to revenues of $4,026,208 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $198,355 or 5%. The decrease in revenues is primarily
attributable to the staffing segment. In order to dedicate Company resources and capital to the telecommunications segment s
new business and to increase gross profit margin, management significantly reduced its focus in the staffing segment. As a result,
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, staffing revenue was $32,547 compared to $2,296,293 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, resulting in a decrease in staffing revenue of $2,263,746 or 99%. Telecommunications revenues increased $2,065,391
or 119% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Telecommunications
revenue for those periods were $3,795,306 and $1,729,915, respectively. This shift in revenue mix resulted in an increase in gross
profit margin from 14% to 37% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively.  

We
had overall revenues of $9,083,959 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to revenues of $11,444,647 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $2,360,688 or 21%. The decrease in revenues is primarily
attributable to the staffing segment as described above. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, staffing revenue was $66,307
compared to $5,622,380 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in a decrease in staffing revenue of $5,556,073
or 99%. Telecommunications revenues increased $3,195,385 or 54% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2105. Telecommunications revenue for those periods were $9,017,652 and $5,822,267, respectively. This
shift in revenue mix resulted in an increase in gross profit margin from 18% to 37% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
and September 30, 2016, respectively.  

Operating
Expenses   

We
reported operating expenses of $1,397,330 and $2,104,995 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing a decrease of $707,665 or 34%. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $676,102, due primarily to
a decrease in legal, accounting, and share based compensation expense. Compensation expense was $605,491 and $645,245 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a decrease of $39,744.  

We
reported operating expenses of $4,394,764 and $4,449,027 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
representing a decrease of $54,263 or 1%. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $398,421 due primarily to decreases
in audit, legal, and stock based compensation expense, which was offset by $395,804 increase in occupancy costs. Compensation
expense was $1,705,892 and $1,594,552 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase
of $111,340. This increase is attributable primarily to an increase in salary expense and related ancillary expenses due to the
addition of key personnel for our business development team.  

Operating
Income and Loss   

Operating
loss decreased by $1,581,894 or 102% to operating income of $27,918 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
a loss of $1,553,976 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit
as described above, with a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and an increase in occupancy costs.  

Operating
loss decreased by $1,398,448 from a loss of $959,773 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $2,358,221
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit as described above,
with a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses, partially offset by increases in occupancy expense.  

Other
Income and Expense   

Other
income and expense increased by $1,069,633 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the same period
in the previous year, primarily due to a $971,956 decrease in forbearance expense, offset by increases in amortization expense,
transaction fees, a one time fair value expense on the term loan, and incentive expense. The increase in amortization and interest
expense is mainly attributable to the senior credit facility effective October 28, 2015.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, other income and expense increased by $813,950 primarily due to an increase
in interest expense, amortization expense, and a one time fair value expense.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Overview   

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $16 million. In addition, the Company has a working
capital deficiency of $2.6 million as of September 30, 2016.  

Management s
plans are to continue to raise additional funds through the sales of debt and equity.  

There
is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain and close financing,
including the aforementioned transactions, on terms acceptable to the Company and whether the Company will become profitable and
generate positive operating cash flow. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop
and implement a plan to further extend payables and reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further
operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.  

Cash
Flows for the Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Cash
Provided by/Used in Operating Activities   

Net
cash used in operating activities was $6,834,114 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to cash provided
by operating activities of $934,399 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to accounts receivable and other current assets, partially offset
by accounts payable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was attributable to forbearance
expense and accounts payable.  

Cash
Provided by/Used in Investing Activities   

We
provided $2,694,319 cash from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to cash provided
of $28,320 during the same period of the previous year. Cash provided by investing activities in the current period was primarily
related to proceeds received from the restricted cash account.  

Cash
Provided by/Used in Financing Activities   

Cash
provided by financing activities was $3,943,248 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to cash used of $796,351
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash provided by financing activities
consisted principally of issuance of notes payable and restricted cash account drawdowns. During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, cash used was derived from primarily payments on our factoring line of credit and payments made on notes payable.  

Management s
Liquidity Plans   

Management s
plans are to continue to raise additional funds through the sales of debt or equity securities. However, there is no assurance
that additional funding will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain and close financing on terms acceptable
to the Company and whether the Company will become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow. If the Company is unable
to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables and reduce overhead
until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations.  

Backlog   

As
of September 30, 2016, we had a backlog of unfilled contracts and master service agreements of approximately $32,500,000. We define
backlog as the value of work-in-hand to be provided for customers as of a specific date where the following conditions are met
(with the exception of engineering change orders): (i) the price of the work to be done is fixed; (ii) the scope of the work to
be done is fixed, both in definition and amount; and (iii) there is a written contract, purchase order, agreement or other documentary
evidence which represents a firm commitment by the customer to pay us for the work to be performed. These backlog amounts are
based on contract values and purchase orders and may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated period
or at all. We may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting
from external market factors and economic factors beyond our control and we may experience such delays or cancellations in the
future. Backlog does not include new firm commitments that may be awarded to us by our customers from time to time in future periods.
These new project awards could be started and completed in this same future period. Accordingly, our backlog does not necessarily
represent the total revenue that could be earned by us in future periods.

required by this Item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

Our
management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (who is
our Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (who is our Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting
Officer), of the effectiveness of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
or 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2016, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September
30, 2016.  

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board ( PCOAB ) Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude
that as of September 30, 2016 our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:  

1.
We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  

2.
We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company s ability to gather, analyze
and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation
of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the
initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals.  

3.
We do not have personnel with sufficient experience with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States to address
complex transactions.  

4.
We have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on
a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting.  

5.
We have determined that oversight over our external financial reporting and internal control over our financial reporting by our
audit committee is ineffective. The audit committee has not provided adequate review of the Company s SEC s filings
and consolidated financial statements and has not provided adequate supervision and review of the Company s accounting personnel
or oversight of the independent registered accounting firm s audit of the Company s consolidated financial statement.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, or in other factors
that could significantly affect these controls, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.  

Inherent
Limitations of Controls    

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
all error and all fraud. Controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or deterioration
in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

Legal
Matters - The Company is involved in litigation claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal fees and other costs
associated with such actions are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company assesses, in conjunction with its legal counsel,

a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. On November 20, 2015, the Company settled the Martin and Arey lawsuit
for $150,000 cash, a promissory note for $250,000, and common stock of 512,820, having a value of $5,120. On November 24, 2015,

other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, to the Company or to an Affiliate of a Purchaser or in
connection with a pledge as contemplated in Section 4.1(b), the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide to the Company
an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration of such transferred
Securities under the Securities Act. As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and shall have the rights and obligations of a Purchaser under this
Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.  

(b) The
Purchasers agree to the imprinting, so long as is required by this Section 4.1, of a legend on any of the Securities in the following
form:  

[NEITHER]
THIS SECURITY [NOR THE SECURITIES FOR WHICH THIS SECURITY IS EXERCISABLE] [HAS NOT] [HAVE] BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE  SECURITIES ACT ), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT
SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED
BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY.
THIS SECURITY [AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF THIS SECURITY] MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN
ACCOUNT WITH A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER LOAN WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS AN  ACCREDITED INVESTOR 
AS DEFINED IN RULE 501(a) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES.  

The
Company acknowledges and agrees that a Purchaser may from time to time pledge pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement with a
registered broker-dealer or grant a security interest in some or all of the Securities to a financial institution that is an  accredited
investor  as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act and who agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement
and the Registration Rights Agreement and, if required under the terms of such arrangement, such Purchaser may transfer, pledge
or secure Securities to the pledgees or secured parties. Such a pledge or transfer would not be subject to approval of the Company
and no legal opinion of legal counsel of the pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection therewith. Further,
no notice shall be required of such pledge. At the applicable Purchaser s expense, the Company will execute and deliver
such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party of Securities may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or
transfer of the Securities, including, if the Securities are subject to registration pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement,
the preparation and filing of any required prospectus supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act or other applicable
provision of the Securities Act to appropriately amend the list of selling stockholders thereunder.  

(c) Certificates

a registration statement (including the Registration Statement) covering the resale of such security is effective under the Securities
Act, (ii) following any sale of such Offering Shares pursuant to Rule 144, (iii) if such Offering Shares are eligible for sale
under Rule 144, without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information required under
Rule 144 as to such Offering Shares and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions, (iv) if such legend is not required under
applicable requirements of the Securities Act (including judicial interpretations and pronouncements issued by the staff of the
Commission) or (v) following the Effective Date. Upon the receipt by the Company of any reasonable certifications from the Purchasers
requested by the Company with respect to future sales of such Offering Shares, the Company shall cause its counsel to issue a
legal opinion to the Transfer Agent if required by the Transfer Agent to effect the removal of the legend hereunder. The Company
agrees that following such time as such legend is no longer required under this Section 4.1(c), it will, as soon as practicable
following the delivery by a Purchaser to the Company or the Transfer Agent of a certificate representing Offering Shares issued
with a restrictive legend and, in each case, any reasonable certifications from the Purchaser requested by the Company or the

representing such shares that is free from all restrictive and other legends. The Company may not make any notation on its records

Company is then a participant in such system.  

(d) Each
Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, agrees with the Company that such Purchaser will sell any Securities
pursuant to either the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including any applicable prospectus delivery requirements,
or an exemption therefrom, and that if Securities are sold pursuant to a Registration Statement, they will be sold in compliance
with the plan of distribution set forth therein, and acknowledges that the removal of the restrictive legend from certificates
representing Securities as set forth in this Section 4.1 is predicated upon the Company s reliance upon this understanding.  

4.2  Acknowledgment

of Common Stock, which dilution may be substantial under certain market conditions. The Company further acknowledges that its
obligations under the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, its obligation to issue the Investor Warrant Shares
pursuant to the Transaction Documents, are unconditional and absolute and not subject to any right of set off, counterclaim, delay
or reduction, regardless of the effect of any such dilution or any claim the Company may have against any Purchaser and regardless
of the dilutive effect that such issuance may have on the ownership of the other stockholders of the Company.  

4.3  Furnishing
of Information; Public Information . Commencing on the Effective Date, and until the earliest of the time that (a) no Purchaser
owns Securities or (b) the Investor Warrants have expired, the Company covenants to have obtained and will thereafter maintain
the registration of the Common Stock under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act and to timely file (or obtain extensions

Date pursuant to the Exchange Act even if the Company is not then subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.  

4.4  Integration .
The Company shall not sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as defined
in Section 2 of the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Securities in a manner that would require
the registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Securities or that would be integrated with the offer or sale of
the Securities for purposes of the rules and regulations of any Trading Market such that it would require shareholder approval
prior to the closing of such other transaction unless shareholder approval is obtained before the closing of such subsequent transaction.  

4.5  Exercise
Procedures . The form of Notice of Exercise included in the Investor Warrants sets forth the totality of the procedures required
of the Purchasers in order to exercise the Investor Warrants. No additional legal opinion, other information or instructions shall
be required of the Purchasers to exercise their Investor Warrants. The Company shall honor exercises of the Investor Warrants
and shall deliver Investor Warrant Shares in accordance with the terms, conditions and time periods set forth in the Transaction
Documents.

following the Execution Date, file a Current Report on Form 8-K and press release disclosing the material terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Transaction Documents as exhibits thereto. From and after the issuance of such press release,
the Company represents to the Purchasers that it shall have publicly disclosed all material, non-public information delivered
to any of the Purchasers by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees
or agents in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The Company and each Purchaser shall

consent of the Company, with respect to any press release of any Purchaser, or without the prior consent of each Purchaser, with
respect to any press release of the Company, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, except if such disclosure
is required by law, in which case the disclosing party shall promptly provide the other party with prior notice of such public
statement or communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not publicly disclose the name of any Purchaser,
or include the name of any Purchaser in any filing with the Commission or any regulatory agency or Trading Market, without the
prior written consent of such Purchaser, except: (a) as required by federal securities law in connection with (i) any registration
statement contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement and (ii) the filing of final Transaction Documents (including conformed
signature pages thereto) with the Commission and (b) to the extent such disclosure is required by law or Trading Market regulations,
in which case the Company shall provide the Purchasers with prior notice of such disclosure permitted under this clause (b).  

4.7  Non-Public
Information . Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, the Company covenants and agrees that neither it, nor any other Person acting on its behalf, will provide any Purchaser

information or is an Affiliate of the Company. The Company understands and confirms that each Purchaser shall be relying on the
foregoing covenant in effecting transactions in securities of the Company.  

4.8  Use
of Proceeds . The Company shall use the net proceeds from the sale of the Securities hereunder for general corporate purposes
including, but not limited to, growth initiatives and capital expenditures, and shall not use such proceeds: (a) for the satisfaction
of any portion of the Company s debt (other than payment of trade payables in the ordinary course of the Company s
business and prior practices), (b) for the redemption of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or (c) the settlement of
any outstanding litigation.

officers, shareholders, members, partners, employees and agents (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of
a Person holding such titles notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title), each Person who controls such Purchaser
(within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, shareholders,
agents, members, partners or employees (and any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles

harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, contingencies, damages, costs and expenses, including all
judgments, amounts paid in settlements, court costs and reasonable attorneys  fees and costs of investigation that any such
Purchaser Party may suffer or incur as a result of or relating to (a) any breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements made by the Company in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents or (b) any action instituted against
Purchaser Parties in any capacity, or any of them or their respective Affiliates, by any stockholder of the Company who is not
an Affiliate of such Purchaser Party, with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (unless
such action is based upon a breach of such Purchaser Party s representations, warranties or covenants under the Transaction
Documents or any agreements or understandings such Purchaser Party may have with any such stockholder or any violations by such
Purchaser Party of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such Purchaser Party which constitutes fraud, gross negligence,
willful misconduct or malfeasance). If any action shall be brought against any Purchaser Party in respect of which indemnity may
be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Purchaser Party shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser Party. Any
Purchaser Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Purchaser Party except to the extent that (i) the employment
thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed after a reasonable period of time
to assume such defense and to employ counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, a material
conflict on any material issue between the position of the Company and the position of such Purchaser Party, in which case the
Company shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel. The Company will
not be liable to any Purchaser Party under this Agreement (y) for any settlement by a Purchaser Party effected without the Company s
prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or (z) to the extent, but only to the extent that
a loss, claim, damage or liability is attributable to any Purchaser Party s breach of its representations, warranties or
covenants under the Transaction Documents or any agreements or understandings such Purchaser Party may have with any such stockholder
or any violations by such Purchaser Party of state or federal securities laws or any conduct by such Purchaser Party which constitutes
fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or malfeasance. The indemnification required by this Section 4.9 shall be made by
periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or are
incurred. The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to any cause of action or similar right of any Purchaser
Party against the Company or others and any liabilities the Company may be subject to pursuant to law.  

4.10
 Reservation and Listing of Securities .  

(a) The
Company shall maintain a reserve from its duly authorized shares of Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the Transaction Documents
in such amount as may then be required to fulfill its obligations in full under the Transaction Documents (the   Required
Minimum  ).  

(b) If,
on any date, the number of authorized but unissued (and otherwise unreserved) shares of Common Stock is less than the Required
Minimum on such date, then the Board of Directors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to amend the Company s certificate
of incorporation to increase the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to at least the Required Minimum at
such time, as soon as possible and in any event not later than the 60 th  day after such date.  

(c) The
Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offering Shares to be approved for listing and actually listed on the Company s
principal Trading Market, if any.  

4.11  Equal
Treatment of Purchasers . No consideration (including any modification of any Transaction Document) shall be offered or paid
to any Person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of any of this Agreement unless the same consideration
is also offered to all of the parties to this Agreement. For clarification purposes, this provision constitutes a separate right
granted to each Purchaser by the Company and negotiated separately by each Purchaser, and is intended for the Company to treat
the Purchasers as a class and shall not in any way be construed as the Purchasers acting in concert or as a group with respect
to the purchase, disposition or voting of Securities or otherwise.  

4.12  Certain
Transactions and Confidentiality . Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, covenants that neither
it, nor any Affiliate acting on its behalf or pursuant to any understanding with it will execute any purchases or sales, including
Short Sales, of any of the Company s securities during the period commencing with the execution of this Agreement and ending
at such time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release
as described in Section 4.6. Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, covenants that until such time
as the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are publicly disclosed by the Company pursuant to the initial press release
as described in Section 4.6, such Purchaser will maintain the confidentiality of the existence and terms of this transaction and
the information included in the Transaction Documents and the Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) no Purchaser makes
any representation, warranty or covenant hereby that it will not engage in effecting transactions in any securities of the Company
after the time that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press
release as described in Section 4.6, (ii) no Purchaser shall be restricted or prohibited from effecting any transactions in any
securities of the Company in accordance with applicable securities laws from and after the time that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are first publicly announced pursuant to the initial press release as described in Section 4.6 and (iii) no
Purchaser shall have any duty of confidentiality to the Company or its Subsidiaries after the issuance of the initial press release
as described in Section 4.6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser that is a multi-managed investment vehicle
whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate portions of such Purchaser s assets and the portfolio managers have
no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other portions of such Purchaser s
assets, the covenant set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that
made the investment decision to purchase the Securities covered by this Agreement.  

4.13  Form
D; Blue Sky Filings . The Company agrees to timely file a Form D with respect to the Securities as required under Regulation
D. The Company shall take such action as the Company shall reasonably determine is necessary in order to obtain an exemption for,
or to qualify the Securities for, sale to the Purchasers at each Closing under applicable securities or  Blue Sky 
laws of the states of the United States, and shall provide evidence of such actions promptly upon request of any Purchaser.

whatsoever on the obligations between the Company and the other Purchasers, by written notice to the other parties, if the Initial

without notice, to November 30, 2016 with the consent of the Company and Laidlaw;  provided ,  further ,  however ,

outstanding, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom enforcement of any such waived provision is sought. No waiver
of any default with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver
in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall
any delay or omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right.  

5.6  Headings .

assigns. The Company may not assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of

5.10  Survival .
The representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the Closing and the delivery of the Securities.  

5.11  Execution .
This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to each other party, it being
understood that the parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission
or by e-mail delivery of a  .pdf  format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of
the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or  .pdf 
signature page were an original thereof.  

5.12  Severability .
If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated
by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that
they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be
hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.  

5.13  Rescission
and Withdrawal Right . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in (and without limiting any similar provisions of)
any of the other Transaction Documents, whenever any Purchaser exercises a right, election, demand or option under a Transaction
Document and the Company does not timely perform its related obligations within the periods therein provided, then such Purchaser
may rescind or withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written notice to the Company, any relevant notice, demand
or election in whole or in part without prejudice to its future actions and rights;  provided ,  however , that in the
case of a rescission of an exercise of an Investor Warrant, the applicable Purchaser shall be required to return any shares of
Common Stock subject to any such rescinded exercise notice concurrently with the return to such Purchaser of the aggregate exercise
price paid to the Company for such shares and the restoration of such Purchaser s right to acquire such shares pursuant
to such Purchaser s Investor Warrant (including, issuance of a replacement warrant certificate evidencing such restored
right).  

5.14  Replacement
of Securities . If any certificate or instrument evidencing any Securities is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company
shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation thereof (in the case of mutilation),
or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate or instrument, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction. The applicant for a new certificate or instrument under such circumstances
shall also pay any reasonable third-party costs (including customary indemnity) associated with the issuance of such replacement
Securities.  

5.15  Remedies .
In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of
the Purchasers and the Company will be entitled to specific performance under the Transaction Documents. The parties agree that
monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations contained in the
Transaction Documents and hereby agree to waive and not to assert in any action for specific performance of any such obligation
the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.  

5.16  Payment
Set Aside . To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments to any Purchaser pursuant to any Transaction Document
or a Purchaser enforces or exercises its rights thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or
exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from,
disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other Person
under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action),
then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived
and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.  

5.17  Independent
Nature of Purchasers  Obligations and Rights.  The obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document are
several and not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance
or non-performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. Nothing contained herein or in any
other Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the
Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers
are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the
rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser
to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser has been represented by its own separate
legal counsel in its review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. The Company has elected to provide all Purchasers with
the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested to do
so by any of the Purchasers. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement and in each
other Transaction Document is between the Company and a Purchaser, solely, and not between the Company and the Purchasers collectively
and not between and among the Purchasers.  

5.18  Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required
or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
Business Day.  

5.19  Construction .
The parties agree that each of them and/or their respective counsel have reviewed and had an opportunity to revise the Transaction
Documents and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting
party shall not be employed in the interpretation of the Transaction Documents or any amendments thereto. In addition, each and
every reference to share prices and shares of Common Stock in any Transaction Document shall be subject to adjustment for reverse
and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the Common Stock that occur after
the Execution Date.  

5.20   WAIVER
OF JURY TRIAL . IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING IN ANY JURISDICTION BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY, THE PARTIES
EACH KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HEREBY ABSOLUTELY, UNCONDITIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY
AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES FOREVER TRIAL BY JURY.   

5.21  Liquidated
Damages . The Company s obligations to pay any partial liquidated damages or other amounts owing under the Transaction
Documents is a continuing obligation of the Company and shall not terminate until all unpaid partial liquidated damages and other
amounts have been paid notwithstanding the fact that the instrument or security pursuant to which such partial liquidated damages
or other amounts are due and payable shall have been canceled.

COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT  

FTE
NETWORKS, INC.   

Warrant Shares: _______ Initial Exercise Date:
____________, 2016 

THIS COMMON STOCK PURCHASE
WARRANT (the   Warrant  ) certifies that, for value received, ____________________________ or its assigns (the
  Holder  ) is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the limitations on exercise and the conditions hereinafter
set forth, at any time on or after the date hereof (the   Initial Exercise Date  ) and on or prior to the close
of business on __________, 2021 (the   Termination Date  ) but not thereafter, to subscribe for and purchase
from FTE Networks, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the   Company  ), up to _______ shares (as subject to adjustment
hereunder, the   Warrant Shares  ) of Common Stock. The purchase price of one share of Common Stock under this
Warrant shall be equal to the Exercise Price, as defined in Section 2(b). 

Section 1 .  Definitions .
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in that certain Unit Purchase Agreement
(the   Purchase Agreement  ), dated _____________, 2016, among the Company and the purchasers signatory thereto. 

Section 2 .  Exercise . 

a) Exercise
of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times on or after the Initial
Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date by delivery to the Company (or such other office or agency of the Company
as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address of the Holder appearing on the books of the Company)
of a duly executed facsimile copy of the Notice of Exercise Form annexed hereto. Within five (5) Trading Days following the date
of exercise as aforesaid, the Holder shall deliver the aggregate Exercise Price for the shares specified in the applicable Notice
of Exercise by wire transfer or cashier s check drawn on a United States bank. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the
Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this
Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three (3) Trading Days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to
the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available
hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal
to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of
Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise Form
within one (1) Business Day of receipt of such notice.  The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge
and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder,
the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the face
hereof.  

b)  Exercise
Price . The exercise price per share of the Common Stock under this Warrant shall be  $0.80 , subject to adjustment hereunder
(the   Exercise Price  ). 

c)  Mechanics
of Exercise . 

i.  Delivery
of Certificates Upon Exercise . Certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the
Holder by crediting the account of the Holder s prime broker with The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal
at Custodian system (  DWAC  ) if the Company is then a participant in such system and there is an effective
registration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder or otherwise
by physical delivery to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise by the date that is five (5) Trading Days
after the latest of (A) the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, (B) surrender of this Warrant (if required) and
(C) payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as set forth above (such date, the   Warrant Share Delivery Date  ).
The Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person so designated to be named therein shall
be deemed to have become a holder of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised, with
payment to the Company of the Exercise Price and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to Section 2(c)(vi)
prior to the issuance of such shares, having been paid. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder certificates
evidencing the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the
Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise (based
on the VWAP (as defined below) of the Common Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10 per Trading Day (increasing
to $20 per Trading Day on the fifth Trading Day after such liquidated damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day after such
Warrant Share Delivery Date until such certificates are delivered.   VWAP   means, as of any particular date:
(a) the volume weighted average of the closing sales prices of the Common Stock for such day on all domestic securities exchanges
on which the Common Stock may at the time be listed; (b) if there have been no sales of the Common Stock on any such exchange
on any such day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices for the Common Stock on all such exchanges at the end
of such day; (c) if on any such day the Common Stock is not listed on a domestic securities exchange, the closing sales price
of the Common Stock as quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. or similar quotation system or association for
such day; or (d) if there have been no sales of the Common Stock on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. or similar quotation
system or association on such day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices for the Common Stock quoted on the OTCQB
tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. or similar quotation system or association at the end of such day; in each case, averaged
over twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately prior to the day as of which  VWAP 
is being determined. If at any time the Common Stock is not listed on any domestic securities exchange or quoted on the the OTCQB
tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. or similar quotation system or association, the  VWAP  of the Common Stock shall
be the fair market value per share as determined jointly by the Board of Directors acting in good faith. 

ii.  Delivery
of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing Warrant
Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called
for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant. 

iii.  Rescission
Rights . If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the certificates representing
the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2(c)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind
such exercise. 

iv.  Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Exercise . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the certificates representing the
Warrant Shares pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required
by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases,
shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving
upon such exercise (a   Buy-In  ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by
which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so
purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver
to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase
obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number
of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to
the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise
and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000
to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to
such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay
the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect
of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s
right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares
of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

v.  No Fractional
Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant.
As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall,
at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied
by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share. 

vi.  Charges,
Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or
transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall
be paid by the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed
by the Holder;  provided ,  however , that in the event certificates for Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other
than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto
duly executed by the Holder and the Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse
it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of
any Notice of Exercise. 

vii.  Closing
of Books . The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of
this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof. 

d)  Holder s
Exercise Limitations . The Company shall not affect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to
exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance
after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and
any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates), would beneficially own
in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares
of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of
Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned
by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other
securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion
or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. Except as
set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance
with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder
that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation
contained in this Section 2(d) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities
owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion
of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder s determination of whether this
Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion
of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation
to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
For purposes of this Section 2(d), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company s most recent periodic or annual report filed with
the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by
the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request
of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect
to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the
date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The   Beneficial Ownership Limitation  
shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon not less than 61 days  prior notice to the Company,
may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(d), provided that the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to
the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(d)
shall continue to apply. Any such increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61 st  day after such notice is
delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict
conformity with the terms of this Section 2(d) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent
with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to
properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this
Warrant. 

Section 3 .  Certain
Adjustments . 

a)  Stock
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable
in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon
exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification
of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding
immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that
the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become
effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution
and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b)  Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly,
effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets
in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether
by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange
their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common
Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization
or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted
into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group
acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person
or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share
purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a   Fundamental Transaction  ), then, upon any subsequent
exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon
such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard
to any limitation in Section 2(d) on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of shares of capital stock of the successor or
acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the   Alternate
Consideration  ) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation
in Section 2(d) on the exercise of this Warrant). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall
be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in
respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among
the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate
Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental
Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of
this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction
in which the Company is not the survivor (the   Successor Entity  ) to assume in writing all of the obligations
of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(b) pursuant
to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable
delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this
Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this
Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity)
equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations
on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise
price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant
to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such
exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of
such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of
any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date
of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents referring to the  Company 
shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the
obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity
had been named as the Company herein. 

c)  Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

d)  Notice
to Holder . 

i.  Adjustment
to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall
promptly mail to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the
number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii.  Notice
to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the
Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the
Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares
of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection
with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last
address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record
or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of
the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined
or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become
effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange
their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing
thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any
notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries,
the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K if the Company
is then subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Holder shall remain entitled to
exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering such
notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein. 

Section 4 .  Transfer
of Warrant . 

a)  Transferability .
This Warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration rights) are transferable, in whole or in
part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment
of this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient
to pay any transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company
shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination
or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion
of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. The Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance
herewith, may be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued. 

b)  New Warrants .
This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of the Company, together
with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by the Holder or its
agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such division or combination,
the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided or combined
in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the initial issuance date of this
Warrant and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto. 

c)  Warrant
Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the   Warrant
Register  ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered
Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder,
and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary. 

Section 5 .  Miscellaneous . 

a)  No Rights
as Stockholder Until Exercise . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights, dividends or other rights as
a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(c)(i). 

b)  Loss,
Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant
Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case
of the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate,
if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation,
in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate. 

c)  Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required
or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
Business Day. 

d)  Authorized
Shares . 

The Company covenants
that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient
number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant.
The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged
with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for the Warrant Shares upon the
exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure
that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements
of the Trading Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued
upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by
this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect
of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue). 

Except and to
the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending
its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue
or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms
of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such
actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of the Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above
the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares
upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions
or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform
its obligations under this Warrant. 

Before taking
any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the
Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary
from any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e)  Jurisdiction .
All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement. 

f)  Restrictions .
The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will have restrictions
upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws. 

g)  Nonwaiver
and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate
as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies. Without limiting any other provision
of this Warrant or the Purchase Agreement, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant,
which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to
cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys  fees, including those of appellate proceedings,
incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies
hereunder. 

h)  Notices .
Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered
in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement. 

i)  Limitation
of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase
Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder
for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company. 

j)  Remedies .
The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled
to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert
the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

k)  Successors
and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and
shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares. 

l)  Amendment .
This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and holders holding
Warrants to acquire 67% of the Warrant Shares issuable pursuant to the Warrants that were issued under the Purchase Agreement. 

m)  Severability .
Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions
of this Warrant. 

n)  Headings .
The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of
this Warrant.

in its possession or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense, necessary to verify the accuracy of the information
contained in the Memorandum, including, but not limited to, the terms and conditions of the Securities as set forth therein, and
the Transaction Documents and all other related documents received or reviewed in connection with the purchase of the Securities
and have had the opportunity to have representatives of the Company provide them with such additional information regarding the
terms and conditions of this particular investment and the financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects
of the Company deemed relevant by the Purchaser or its Advisors, if any, and all such requested information, to the extent the
Company had such information in its possession or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense, has been provided by
the Company in writing to the full satisfaction of the Purchaser and its Advisors, if any; 

(s) The Purchaser represents
to the Company that any information which the undersigned has heretofore furnished or is furnishing herewith to the Company is

under federal and state securities laws in connection with the offering of securities as described in the Memorandum; 

(t) The Purchaser has significant
prior investment experience, including investment in non-listed and non-registered securities. The Purchaser has a sufficient
net worth to sustain a loss of its entire investment in the Company in the event such a loss should occur. The Purchaser s
overall commitment to investments which are not readily marketable is not excessive in view of the Purchaser s net worth
and financial circumstances and the purchase of the Securities will not cause such commitment to become excessive. This investment
is a suitable one for the Purchaser; 

(u) The Purchaser is satisfied
that it has received adequate information with respect to all matters which it or its Advisors, if any, consider material to its
decision to make this investment;

statements cannot be guaranteed, will not be updated by the Company and should not be relied upon; 

(w) No oral or written representations
have been made, or oral or written information furnished, to the Purchaser or its Advisors, if any, in connection with the offering
of the Securities which are in any way inconsistent with the information contained in the Memorandum; 

(x) Within five (5) days
after receipt of a request from the Company, the Purchaser will provide such information and deliver such documents as may reasonably
be necessary to comply with any and all laws and ordinances to which the Company is subject; 

(y) THE PURCHASER ACKNOWLEGES

IS UNLAWFUL; 

(z) The Purchaser acknowledges
that the Securities have not been recommended by any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority. In making
an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the Company and the terms of the Offering, including the
merits and risks involved. Furthermore, the foregoing authorities have not confirmed the accuracy or determined the adequacy of
this Subscription Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The
Securities are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted
under the Securities Act and the applicable state securities laws or pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. Investors
should be aware that they will be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time; 

(aa)  (For ERISA plans
only)  The fiduciary of the ERISA plan (the    Plan   ) represents that such fiduciary has been informed
of and understands the Company s investment objectives, policies and strategies, and that the decision to invest  plan
assets  (as such term is defined in ERISA) in the Company is consistent with the provisions of ERISA that require diversification
of plan assets and impose other fiduciary responsibilities. The Purchaser or Plan fiduciary (a) is responsible for the decision
to invest in the Company; (b) is independent of the Company and any of its affiliates; (c) is qualified to make such investment
decision; and (d) in making such decision, the Purchaser or Plan fiduciary has not relied on any advice or recommendation of the
Company or any of its affiliates; and 

(bb) The Purchaser has read
in its entirety the Memorandum and the Transaction Documents and all exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto, including, but not
limited to, all information relating to the Company and the Securities, and understands to its full satisfaction all information
included in the Transaction Documents and the Memorandum, including, but not limited to, the section entitled  Risk Factors 
in the Memorandum. 

(cc) The Purchaser represents
that (i) the Purchaser was contacted regarding the sale of   in the Securities by the Company or the Placement Agent (or
another person whom the Purchaser believed to be an authorized agent or representative thereof) with whom the Purchaser had a
prior substantial pre-existing relationship and (ii) it did not learn of the offering of the Securities by means of any form of

whether closed circuit, or generally available; or (B) attend any seminar meeting or industry investor conference whose attendees
were invited by any general solicitation or general advertising;.

that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or  blue sky  laws
and setting forth or referring to the restrictions on transferability and sale thereof contained in this Agreement. The Purchaser
is aware that the Company will make a notation in its appropriate records with respect to the restrictions on the transferability
of such Securities. The legend to be placed on each certificate shall be in form substantially similar to the following: 

THE SECURITIES
REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE  ACT )
OR ANY STATE SECURITIES OR  BLUE SKY LAWS,  AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED
ABSENT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION THEREOF UNDER SUCH ACT OR COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144 PROMULGATED UNDER SUCH ACT, OR UNLESS THE

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS  

The
    USA PATRIOT Act   
       
       What
    is money laundering?   
       
       How
    big is the problem and why is it important?    
 
      The
                                         USA PATRIOT Act is designed to detect, deter, and punish terrorists in the United States
                                         and abroad. The Act imposes new anti-money laundering requirements on brokerage firms
                                         and financial institutions. Since April 24, 2002 all brokerage firms have been required
                                         to have new, comprehensive anti-money laundering programs. 
           
         To help you understand these efforts,
        we want to provide you with some information about money laundering and our steps to implement the USA PATRIOT Act.  
       
      Money
    laundering is the process of disguising illegally obtained money so that the funds appear to come from legitimate sources
    or activities. Money laundering occurs in connection with a wide variety of crimes, including illegal arms sales, drug trafficking,
    robbery, fraud, racketeering, and terrorism  
       
      The
    use of the U.S. financial system by criminals to facilitate terrorism or other crimes could well taint our financial markets.
    According to the U.S. State Department, one recent estimate puts the amount of worldwide money laundering activity at $1 trillion
    a year.   

What are we required to do to eliminate
money laundering?  

Under new rules required by the USA PATRIOT
Act, our anti-money laundering program must designate a special compliance officer, set up employee training, conduct independent
audits, and establish policies and procedures to detect and report suspicious transaction and ensure compliance with the new laws. 

As part of our required program, we may ask
you to provide various identification documents or other information. Until you provide the information or documents we need,
we may not be able to effect any transactions for you.

or prior to each Filing Date, the Company shall prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement covering the resale
of all of the Registrable Securities that are not then registered on an effective Registration Statement for an offering to be
made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415. Each Registration Statement filed hereunder shall be on Form S-3 (except if the
Company is not then eligible to register for resale the Registrable Securities on Form S-3, in which case such registration shall
be on another appropriate form in accordance herewith, subject to the provisions of Section 2(e)) and shall contain (unless otherwise
directed by at least 85% in interest of the Holders) substantially the   Plan of Distribution   attached hereto
as  Annex A . Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause a Registration
Statement filed under this Agreement (including, without limitation, under Section 3(c)) to be declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as possible after the filing thereof, but in any event no later than the applicable Effectiveness Date, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until the
first to occur of: (A) the date that is one (1) year from the date the Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission
(the   Cut-Off Date  ) and (B) the date that all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
(i) have been sold, thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144, or (ii) may be sold without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant
to Rule 144 and without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under
Rule 144, as determined by the counsel to the Company pursuant to a written opinion letter which shall be obtained at the company s
expense, to such effect, addressed, delivered and acceptable to the Transfer Agent and the affected Holders (assuming that such
securities, any securities upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of or as a dividend upon which such securities were issued,
or any securities issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of, or as a dividend upon such securities, were at no time
held by any Affiliate of the Company) (the   Effectiveness Period  ). The Company shall telephonically request
effectiveness of a Registration Statement as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a Trading Day. The Company shall immediately notify
the Holders via facsimile or by e-mail of the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on the same Trading Day that the Company
telephonically confirms effectiveness with the Commission, which shall be the date requested for effectiveness of such Registration
Statement. The Company shall, by 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the Trading Day after the effective date of such Registration Statement,
file a final Prospectus with the Commission as required by Rule 424. Failure to so notify the Holder within one (1) Trading Day
of such notification of effectiveness or failure to file a final Prospectus as foresaid shall be deemed an Event under Section
2(d). 

(b)       
Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in Section 2(a), if the Commission informs the Company that all of the
Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on
a single registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly inform each of the Holders thereof and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to file amendments to the Initial Registration Statement as required by the Commission, covering the maximum number of
Registrable Securities permitted to be registered by the Commission, on Form S-3 or such other form available to register for
resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering, subject to the provisions of Section 2(e);  provided ,  however ,
that prior to filing such amendment, the Company shall be obligated to use diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for
the registration of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the SEC Guidance, including without limitation, Compliance
and Disclosure Interpretation 612.09. 

(c)       Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement and subject to the payment of liquidated damages pursuant to Section 2(d), if the Commission
or any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation on the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a particular
Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and notwithstanding that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with the
Commission for the registration of all or a greater portion of Registrable Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by
a Holder as to its Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration Statement
will be reduced as follows: 

(i)  
      First, the Company
    shall reduce or eliminate any securities to be included by any Person other than a Holder;   

(ii)  
      Second, the Company
    shall reduce Registrable Securities represented by Investor Warrant Shares (applied to the Holders on a pro rata basis based
    on the total number of unregistered Investor Warrant Shares held by such Holders, collectively); and    

(iii)  
      Third, the Company
    shall reduce Registrable Securities represented by the Purchase Agreement Shares (applied, in the case that some Purchase
    Agreement Shares may be registered, to the Holders on a pro rata basis based on the total number of unregistered Purchase
    Agreement Shares held by such Holders).    

In the event of
a cutback hereunder, the Company shall give the Holder at least five (5) Trading Days prior written notice along with the calculations
as to such Holder s allotment. In the event the Company amends the Initial Registration Statement in accordance with the
foregoing, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to file with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by the Commission
or SEC Guidance provided to the Company or to registrants of securities in general, one or more registration statements on Form
S-3 or such other form available to register for resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on the
Initial Registration Statement, as amended. 

(d)       If:
(i) the Initial Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to its Filing Date (if the Company files the Initial Registration
Statement without affording the Holders the opportunity to review and comment on the same as required by Section 3(a) herein,
the Company shall be deemed to have not satisfied this clause (i)), or (ii) the Company fails to file with the Commission a request
for acceleration of a Registration Statement in accordance with Rule 461 promulgated by the Commission pursuant to the Securities
Act, within five Trading Days of the date that the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission
that such Registration Statement will not be  reviewed  or will not be subject to further review, or (iii) prior to
the effective date of a Registration Statement, the Company fails to file a pre-effective amendment and otherwise respond in writing
to comments made by the Commission in respect of such Registration Statement within thirty (30) calendar days after the receipt
of comments by or notice from the Commission that such amendment is required in order for such Registration Statement to be declared
effective, or (iv) a Registration Statement registering for resale all of the Registrable Securities is not declared effective
by the Commission by the Effectiveness Date of the Initial Registration Statement, or (v) after the effective date of a Registration
Statement, such Registration Statement ceases for any reason to remain continuously effective as to all Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement, or the Holders are otherwise not permitted to utilize the Prospectus therein to resell
such Registrable Securities, for more than ten (10) consecutive calendar days or more than an aggregate of fifteen (15) calendar
days (which need not be consecutive calendar days) during any 12-month period (any such failure or breach being referred to as
an   Event  , and for purposes of clauses (i) and (iv), the date on which such Event occurs, and for purpose
of clause (ii) the date on which such five (5) Trading Day period is exceeded, and for purpose of clause (iii) the date which
such thirty (30) calendar day period is exceeded, and for purpose of clause (v) the date on which such ten (10) or fifteen (15)
calendar day period, as applicable, is exceeded being referred to as an   Event Date  ), then, in addition to
any other rights the Holders may have hereunder or under applicable law, on each such Event Date and on each thirty (30) calendar
day anniversary of each such Event Date (if the applicable Event shall not have been cured by such date) until the applicable
Event is cured, the Company shall pay to each Holder an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty, equal
to 1.0% of the aggregate purchase price paid by such Holder pursuant to the Purchase Agreement;  provided ,  however ,
that the Company shall not be required to make any payments pursuant to this Section 2(d) if an Event occurred at such time that
all Registrable Securities are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 (without volume restrictions or current public information
requirements) promulgated by the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act;  provided ,  further , that the Company
shall not be required to make any payments pursuant to this Section 2(d) with respect to any Registrable Securities the Company
is unable to register due to limits imposed by the Commission s interpretation of Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The
parties agree that the maximum aggregate liquidated damages payable to a Holder under this Agreement shall be 6.0% of the aggregate
Subscription Amount paid by such Holder pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. If the Company fails to pay any partial liquidated
damages pursuant to this Section in full within seven (7) days after the date payable, the Company will pay interest thereon at
a rate of 18% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law) to the Holder, accruing
daily from the date such partial liquidated damages are due until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full.
The partial liquidated damages pursuant to the terms hereof shall apply on a daily pro rata basis for any portion of a thirty
(30) calendar day period prior to the cure of an Event. 

(e)       If
Form S-3 is not available for the registration of the resale of Registrable Securities hereunder, the Company shall (i) register
the resale of the Registrable Securities on another appropriate form and (ii) undertake to register the Registrable Securities
on Form S-3 as soon as such form is available,  provided  that the Company shall maintain the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement then in effect until such time as a Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the Registrable Securities has been
declared effective by the Commission. 

3.

In
connection with the Company s registration obligations hereunder, the Company shall: 

(a)       Not

to the filing of any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (including any document that would be incorporated
or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference), the Company shall (i) furnish to each Holder copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed, which documents (other than those incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference) will be subject

a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall not be obligated
to provide the Holders advance copies of any universal shelf registration statement registering securities in addition to those
required hereunder, or any Prospectus prepared thereto. The Company shall not file a Registration Statement or any such Prospectus
or any amendments or supplements thereto to which the Holders of 67% or more of the Registrable Securities shall reasonably object
in good faith, provided that, the Company is notified of such objection in writing no later than five (5) Trading Days after the
Holders have been so furnished copies of a Registration Statement or one (1) Trading Day after the Holders have been so furnished
copies of any related Prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto. Each Holder agrees to furnish to the Company a completed
questionnaire in the form attached to this Agreement as  Annex B  (a   Selling Stockholder Questionnaire  )
on a date that is not less than two (2) Trading Days prior to the Filing Date or by the end of the fourth (4 th ) Trading
Day following the date on which such Holder receives draft materials in accordance with this Section. 

(b)       (i)
Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, to a Registration Statement and the
Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep a Registration Statement continuously effective as to the
applicable Registrable Securities for the Effectiveness Period and prepare and file with the Commission such additional Registration
Statements in order to register for resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities, (ii) cause the related
Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement (subject to the terms of this Agreement), and,
as so supplemented or amended, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424, (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably possible to any comments
received from the Commission with respect to a Registration Statement or any amendment thereto and provide as promptly as reasonably

regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), and (iv) comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement during the applicable period in accordance (subject to the terms of this Agreement) with the intended methods of disposition
by the Holders thereof set forth in such Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented. 

(c)       If
during the Effectiveness Period, the number of Registrable Securities at any time exceeds 100% of the number of shares of Common
Stock then registered in a Registration Statement, then the Company shall file as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any case,
prior to the applicable Filing Date, an additional Registration Statement covering the resale by the Holders of not less than
the number of such Registrable Securities. 

(d)       Notify
the Holders of Registrable Securities to be sold (which notice shall, pursuant to clauses (iii) through (vi) hereof, be accompanied
by an instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes have been made) as promptly as reasonably possible
(and, in the case of (i)(A) below, not less than one (1) Trading Day prior to such filing) and (if requested by any such Person)
confirm such notice in writing no later than one (1) Trading Day following the day (i)(A) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement is proposed to be filed, (B) when the Commission notifies the
Company whether there will be a  review  of such Registration Statement and whenever the Commission comments in writing
on such Registration Statement, and (C) with respect to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same
has become effective, (ii) of any request by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority for amendments
or supplements to a Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the Commission
or any other federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement
covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or the initiation of any Proceedings for that purpose, (iv) of the receipt by
the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of
the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such purpose,
(v) of the occurrence of any event or passage of time that makes the financial statements included in a Registration Statement
ineligible for inclusion therein or any statement made in a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated
or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires any revisions to a Registration
Statement, Prospectus or other documents so that, in the case of a Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be,
it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and (vi) of
the occurrence or existence of any pending corporate development with respect to the Company that the Company believes may be
material and that, in the determination of the Company, makes it not in the best interest of the Company to allow continued availability
of a Registration Statement or Prospectus,  provided ,  however , in no event shall any such notice contain any information
which would constitute material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

(e)       Use
its reasonable best efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if issued, obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order stopping or suspending
the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or (ii) any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of
any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment. 

(f)       Furnish
to each Holder, without charge, at least one conformed copy of each such Registration Statement and each amendment thereto, including
financial statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference to the extent
requested by such Person, and all exhibits to the extent requested by such Person (including those previously furnished or incorporated
by reference) promptly after the filing of such documents with the Commission; provided, that any such item which is available
on the EDGAR system (or successor thereto) need not be furnished in physical form. 

(g)       Subject
to the terms of this Agreement, the Company hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto
by each of the selling Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus
and any amendment or supplement thereto, except after the giving of any notice pursuant to Section 3(d). 

(h)       
The Company shall cooperate with any broker-dealer through which a Holder proposes to resell its Registrable Securities in effecting
a filing with the FINRA Corporate Financing Department pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110, as requested by any such Holder, and the Company
shall pay the filing fee required by such filing within two (2) Business Days of request therefor. 

(i)       Prior
to any resale of Registrable Securities by a Holder, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate
with the selling Holders in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from the registration or qualification)
of such Registrable Securities for the resale by the Holder under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within
the United States as any Holder reasonably requests in writing, to keep each registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom)
effective during the Effectiveness Period and to do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary to enable the disposition
in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by each Registration Statement; provided, that, the Company shall
not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, subject the Company
to any material tax in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or file a general consent to service of process in
any such jurisdiction. 

(j)       If
requested by a Holder, cooperate with such Holder to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing
Registrable Securities to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to a Registration Statement, which certificates shall be free,
to the extent permitted by the Purchase Agreement and applicable law, of all restrictive legends, and to enable such Registrable
Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as any such Holder may request. 

(k)       Upon
the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(d), as promptly as reasonably possible under the circumstances taking into
account the Company s good faith assessment of any adverse consequences to the Company and its stockholders of the premature
disclosure of such event, prepare a supplement or amendment, including a post-effective amendment, to a Registration Statement
or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and
file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered, neither a Registration Statement nor such Prospectus will contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If the Company notifies the Holders
in accordance with clauses (iii) through (vi) of Section 3(d) above to suspend the use of any Prospectus until the requisite changes
to such Prospectus have been made, then the Holders shall suspend use of such Prospectus. The Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed as promptly as is practicable. The Company shall be entitled
to exercise its right under this Section 3(k) to suspend the availability of a Registration Statement and Prospectus, subject
to the payment of partial liquidated damages otherwise required pursuant to Section 2(d), for a period not to exceed 60 calendar
days (which need not be consecutive days) in any 12-month period. 

(l)       Comply
with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission. 

(m)       The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain eligibility for use of Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto) for
the registration of the resale of Registrable Securities. 

(n)       The
Company may require each selling Holder to furnish to the Company a certified statement as to the number of shares of Common Stock
beneficially owned by such Holder and, if required by the Commission, the natural persons thereof that have voting and dispositive
control over the shares. During any periods that the Company is unable to meet its obligations hereunder with respect to the registration
of the Registrable Securities solely because any Holder fails to furnish such information within three Trading Days of the Company s
request, any liquidated damages that are accruing at such time as to such Holder only shall be tolled and any Event that may otherwise
occur solely because of such delay shall be suspended as to such Holder only, until such information is delivered to the Company. 

4.         Registration
Expenses . All fees and expenses incident to the performance of or compliance with, this Agreement by the Company shall be
borne by the Company whether or not any Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to a Registration Statement. The fees and expenses
referred to in the foregoing sentence shall include, without limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of the Company s counsel and independent registered public accountants) (A) with respect to
filings made with the Commission, (B) with respect to filings required to be made with any Trading Market on which the Common
Stock is then listed for trading, (C) in compliance with applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws reasonably agreed to by
the Company in writing (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company in connection with Blue
Sky qualifications or exemptions of the Registrable Securities) and (D) if not previously paid by the Company, with respect to
any filing that may be required to be made by any broker through which a Holder intends to make sales of Registrable Securities
with FINRA pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110, so long as the broker is receiving no more than a customary brokerage commission in connection
with such sale, (ii) printing expenses (including, without limitation, expenses of printing certificates for Registrable Securities),
(iii) messenger, telephone and delivery expenses, (iv) fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company, (v) Securities Act liability

connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, the Company shall be responsible
for all of its internal expenses incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties),
the expense of any annual audit and the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the Registrable Securities
on any securities exchange as required hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be responsible for the legal
fees or other costs of the Holders (including the reasonable counsel fees of Laidlaw, as representative of the Holders; provided,
however, that any such counsel fees of Laidlaw shall not exceed $10,000 in the aggregate and any related expenses shall not exceed
$10,000 in the aggregate) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

5.         Indemnification . 

(a)        Indemnification
by the Company . The Company shall, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, indemnify and hold harmless each Holder,
the officers, directors, members, partners, agents, brokers (including brokers who offer and sell Registrable Securities as principal
as a result of a pledge or any failure to perform under a margin call of Common Stock), investment advisors and employees (and
any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles, notwithstanding a lack of such title or
any other title) of each of them, each Person who controls any such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) and the officers, directors, members, stockholders, partners, agents and employees (and
any other Persons with a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles, notwithstanding a lack of such title or
any other title) of each such controlling Person, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees) and expenses
(collectively,   Losses  ), as incurred, arising out of or relating to (1) any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement, any Prospectus or any form of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement
thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or supplement thereto,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading or (2) any violation or alleged violation by the Company
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law, or any rule or regulation thereunder, in connection with
the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent, but only to the extent, that (i) such untrue statements
or omissions are based solely upon information regarding such Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly
for use therein, or to the extent that such information relates to such Holder or such Holder s proposed method of distribution
of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such Holder expressly for use in a Registration
Statement, such Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (it being understood that the Holder has approved Annex A
hereto for this purpose) or (ii) in the case of an occurrence of an event of the type specified in Section 3(d)(iii)-(vi), the
use by such Holder of an outdated, defective or otherwise unavailable Prospectus after the Company has notified such Holder in
writing that the Prospectus is outdated, defective or otherwise unavailable for use by such Holder and prior to the receipt by
such Holder of the Advice contemplated in Section 6(d), but only if and to the extent that following the receipt of the Advice
the misstatement or omission giving rise to such Loss would have been corrected. The Company shall notify the Holders promptly
of the institution, threat or assertion of any Proceeding arising from or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement of which the Company is aware. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of such indemnified person and shall survive the transfer of any Registrable Securities by any of the Holders
in accordance with Section 6(h). 

(b)        Indemnification
by Holders . Each Holder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers,
agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section
20 of the Exchange Act), and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling Persons (and any other Persons with
a functionally equivalent role of a Person holding such titles, notwithstanding a lack of such title or any other title), to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all Losses, as incurred, to the extent arising out of or based solely
upon: (x) such Holder s failure to comply with any applicable prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act or
the plan of distribution in any Registration Statement through no fault of the Company or (y) any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any
preliminary prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made) not misleading (i) to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is
contained in any information so furnished in writing by such Holder to the Company expressly for inclusion in such Registration
Statement or such Prospectus or (ii) to the extent, but only to the extent, that such information relates to such Holder s
proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such Holder expressly
for use in a Registration Statement (it being understood that the Holder has approved Annex A hereto for this purpose), such Prospectus
or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (iii) in the case of an occurrence of an event of the type specified in Section 3(d)(iii)-(vi),
to the extent, but only to the extent, related to the use by such Holder of an outdated, defective or otherwise unavailable Prospectus
after the Company has notified such Holder in writing that the Prospectus is outdated, defective or otherwise unavailable for
use by such Holder and prior to the receipt by such Holder of the Advice contemplated in Section 6(d), but only if and to the
extent that following the receipt of the Advice the misstatement or omission giving rise to such Loss would have been corrected.
In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder under this Section 5(b) be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
net proceeds actually received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification
obligation. 

(c)        Conduct
of Indemnification Proceedings . If any Proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder
(an   Indemnified Party  ), such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Person from whom indemnity is sought
(the   Indemnifying Party  ) in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof; provided, that, the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to the
extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal
or further review) that such failure shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

An Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party
has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses, (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume the defense
of such Proceeding and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding, or (3) the
named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall reasonably believe that a material conflict of interest is likely to exist if
the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party
notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and the reasonable fees and expenses of no more
than one separate counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending
Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding. 

Subject to the
terms of this Agreement, all reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable fees and expenses to
the extent incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent with
this Section) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as incurred, within ten Trading Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying
Party; provided, that, the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for that portion of such fees and
expenses applicable to such actions for which such Indemnified Party is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
(which determination is not subject to appeal or further review) not to be entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

(d)        Contribution .
If the indemnification under Section 5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold an Indemnified
Party harmless for any Losses, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection
with the actions, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of
a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party,
and the parties  relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement
or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Agreement, any reasonable attorneys  or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with
any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the indemnification provided
for in this Section was available to such party in accordance with its terms. 

The parties
hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d), no Holder shall be required to contribute
pursuant to this Section 5(d), in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds actually received
by such Holder from the sale of the Registrable Securities subject to the Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such
Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. 

The indemnity
and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have
to the Indemnified Parties. 

6.         Miscellaneous . 

(a)        Remedies .
In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder of any of their respective obligations under this Agreement, each Holder
or the Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement,
including recovery of damages, shall be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. Each of the Company
and each Holder agrees that monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach
by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance
in respect of such breach, it shall not assert or shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

(b)        No
Piggyback on Registrations; Prohibition on Filing Other Registration Statements . Neither the Company nor any of its security
holders (other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the Company in any Registration Statements
other than the Registrable Securities. The Company shall not file any other registration statements until all Registrable Securities
are registered pursuant to a Registration Statement that is declared effective by the Commission, provided that this Section 6(b)
shall not prohibit the Company from filing amendments to registration statements filed prior to the date of this Agreement. 

(c)        Compliance .
Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as applicable
to it (unless an exemption therefrom is available) in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration
Statement. 

(d)        Discontinued
Disposition . By its acquisition of Registrable Securities, each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company
of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section 3(d)(iii) through (vi), such Holder will forthwith discontinue
disposition of such Registrable Securities under a Registration Statement until it is advised in writing (the   Advice  )
by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus (as it may have been supplemented or amended) may be resumed. The Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed as promptly as is practicable. The
Company agrees and acknowledges that any periods during which the Holder is required to discontinue the disposition of the Registrable
Securities hereunder shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2(d). 

(e)        Piggy-Back
Registrations . If, at any time during the Effectiveness Period, there is not an effective Registration Statement covering
all of the Registrable Securities and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement
relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities,
other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under the Securities Act) or their then equivalents relating to equity
securities to be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or equity securities issuable in connection
with the Company s stock option or other employee benefit plans, then the Company shall deliver to each Holder a written
notice of such determination and, if within fifteen days after the date of the delivery of such notice, any such Holder shall
so request in writing, the Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of such Registrable Securities
such Holder requests to be registered;  provided ,  however , that the Company shall not be required to register any
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 6(e) that are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 (without volume restrictions
or current public information requirements) promulgated by the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act or that are the subject
of a then effective Registration Statement. 

(f)        Amendments
and Waivers . The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Company and the Holders of 67% or more of the then outstanding Registrable Securities (for purposes of clarification,
this includes any Registrable Securities issuable upon exercise or conversion of any Security). If a Registration Statement does
not register all of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a waiver or amendment done in compliance with the previous sentence,
then the number of Registrable Securities to be registered for each Holder shall be reduced pro rata among all Holders and each
Holder shall have the right to designate which of its Registrable Securities shall be omitted from such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates
exclusively to the rights of a Holder or some Holders and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders
may be given only by such Holder or Holders of all of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent relates;  provided ,
 however , that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the
provisions of the first sentence of this Section 6(f). No consideration shall be offered or paid to any Person to amend or consent
to a waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement unless the same consideration also is offered to all of the parties
to this Agreement. 

(g)        Notices .
Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be delivered as
set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 

(h)        Successors
and Assigns . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of each
of the parties and shall inure to the benefit of each Holder. The Company may not assign (except by merger) its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of all of the Holders of the then outstanding Registrable Securities. Each Holder
may assign their respective rights hereunder in the manner and to the Persons as permitted under Section 5.7 of the Purchase Agreement. 

(i)        No
Inconsistent Agreements . Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered, as of the date hereof, nor shall the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its securities,
that would have the effect of impairing the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions
hereof. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights
with respect to any of its securities to any Person that have not been satisfied in full. 

(j)        Execution
and Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be considered
one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other
party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered
by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a  .pdf  format data file, such signature shall create a valid
and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as
if such facsimile or  .pdf  signature page were an original thereof. 

(k)        Governing
Law . All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be determined
in accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement. 

(l)        Cumulative
Remedies . The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law. 

(m)        Severability .
If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated
by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that
they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be
hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable. 

(n)        Headings .
The headings in this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of the Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. 

(o)        Independent
Nature of Holders  Obligations and Rights . The obligations of each Holder hereunder are several and not joint with the
obligations of any other Holder hereunder, and no Holder shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations
of any other Holder hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other agreement or document delivered at any closing, and no
action taken by any Holder pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Holders as a partnership, an association,
a joint venture or any other kind of group or entity, or create a presumption that the Holders are in any way acting in concert
or as a group or entity with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other matters,
and the Company acknowledges that the Holders are not acting in concert or as a group, and the Company shall not assert any such
claim, with respect to such obligations or transactions. Each Holder shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights, including
without limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Holder to be joined as
an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. The use of a single agreement with respect to the obligations of the Company
contained was solely in the control of the Company, not the action or decision of any Holder, and was done solely for the convenience
of the Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by any Holder. It is expressly understood and agreed that
each provision contained in this Agreement is between the Company and a Holder, solely, and not between the Company and the Holders
collectively and not between and among Holders.

Investors:  

The Purchasers set forth on  Appendix A
 to the Purchase Agreement have executed a Subscription Agreement with the Company which provides, among other things, that
by executing the Subscription Agreement each Investor is deemed to have executed this REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT in all respects
and is bound to purchase the Units set forth in such Subscription Agreement and  Appendix A  to the Purchase Agreement. 

Annex A   

Plan of Distribution  

Each Selling Stockholder
(the   Selling Stockholders  ) of the securities and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest
may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on the OTCQX tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. or
any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions. These sales
may be at fixed or negotiated prices. A Selling Stockholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities: 

ordinary brokerage
    transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;   

block trades in
    which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as
    principal to facilitate the transaction;   

purchases by a broker-dealer
    as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;   

an exchange distribution
    in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;   

privately negotiated
    transactions;   

settlement of short
    sales entered into after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part;    

in transactions
    through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified number of such securities at a stipulated
    price per security;   

through the writing
    or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;   

a combination of
    any such methods of sale; or   

any other method
    permitted pursuant to applicable law.   

The Selling Stockholders
may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the   Securities Act  ),
if available, rather than under this prospectus. 

Broker-dealers engaged
by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions
or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser)
in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this Prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction
not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction
a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440. 

In connection with the
sale of the securities or interests therein, the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers
or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions
they assume. The Selling Stockholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions,
or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Stockholders may also enter
into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities
which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of securities offered by this prospectus, which
securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended
to reflect such transaction). 

The Selling Stockholders
and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be  underwriters  within
the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers
or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts
under the Securities Act. Each Selling Stockholder has informed the Company that it does not have any written or oral agreement
or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities. In no event shall any broker-dealer receive
fees, commissions and markups which, in the aggregate, would exceed eight percent (8%). 

The Company is required
to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the registration of the securities. The Company has agreed
to indemnify the Selling Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act. 

Because Selling Stockholders
may be deemed to be  underwriters  within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus
delivery requirements of the Securities Act including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus
which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus.
The Selling Stockholders have advised us that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed
sale of the resale securities by the Selling Stockholders. 

We agreed to keep this
prospectus effective until the earliest of (i) one (1) year from the date the Registration Statement is declared effective by
the Commission, (ii) the date on which the securities may be resold by the Selling Stockholders without registration and without
regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance
with the current public information under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (iii) the date
on which all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule
of similar effect. The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under
applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold unless
they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification
requirement is available and is complied with. 

Under applicable rules
and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously
engage in market making activities with respect to the common stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation
M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Stockholders will be subject to applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases
and sales of securities of the common stock by the Selling Stockholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus
available to the Selling Stockholders and have informed them of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser
at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).

Exhibit D: Form of Legal Opinion   

EXHIBIT D  

LEGAL OPINION  

We have acted as counsel
to FTE Networks, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (the   Company  ), in connection with the Unit Purchase Agreement,
dated as of [August 18], 2016, by and among the Company (the   Purchase Agreement  ) and each purchaser identified
therein, pursuant to which the Company is offering up to 5,000,000 units (the   Units  ) at a price per Unit
of $0.40, with each Unit consisting of (i) one (1) share of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the
  Common Stock  ) and (ii) a warrant to purchase one (1) share of Common Stock (collectively, the   Warrants , 
and together with the Units, the Common Stock and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, the   Securities  ).
We are delivering this opinion letter to you at the Company s request pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Purchase Agreement.
The Purchase Agreement, the Memorandum, the Subscription Agreement, the Investor Warrants, the Registration Rights Agreement,
all exhibits and schedules thereto are referred to collectively in this opinion letter as the   Transaction Documents  .
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this opinion letter have the meanings given to them in the Purchase Agreement. 

In connection with rendering
the opinions set forth below, we have examined (i) the Transaction Documents, (ii) the Company s Articles of Incorporation,
as in effect on the date hereof (the   Articles of Incorporation  ), and (iii) the Company s Bylaws, as
in effect on the date hereof (the   Bylaws  ), and we have examined and considered such corporate records, certificates
and matters of law as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for our opinions set forth below. 

In rendering the opinions
set forth in this opinion letter, we assume the following: 

a. the legal capacity of each natural person
and the legal existence of all parties other than the Company to the transactions referred to in the Transaction Documents; 

b. the power and authority of each person
other than the Company or person(s) acting on behalf of the Company to execute, deliver and perform each document executed and
delivered and to do each other act done or to be done by such person; 

c. the legality, validity, binding effect
and enforceability as to each person other than the Company or person(s) acting on behalf of the Company of each document executed
and delivered or to be executed or delivered and of each other act done or to be done by such person; 

d. the transactions referred to in the
Transaction Documents have been consummated; 

e. the genuineness of all signatures and
the completeness of each document submitted to us; 

f. that the addressees have acted in good
faith, without notice of adverse claims, and have complied with all laws applicable to them that affect the transactions referred
to in the Transaction Documents; 

g. that there have been no undisclosed
modifications of any provision of any document reviewed by us in connection with the rendering of the opinions set forth in this
opinion letter and no undisclosed prior waiver of any right or remedy contained in the Transaction Documents; 

h. the truthfulness of each statement as
to all factual matters otherwise not known to us to be untruthful contained in any document encompassed within the due diligence
review undertaken by us; 

i. the accuracy on the date of this letter
as well as on the date stated in all governmental certifications of each statement as to each factual matter contained in such
governmental certifications; 

j. that the addressee has acted in good
faith, without notice of adverse claims, and has complied with all laws applicable to it that affect the transactions referred
to in the Transaction Documents; 

k. that the transactions referred to in
the Transaction Documents comply with all tests of good faith, fairness and conscionability required by law; 

l. that other agreements related to the
Transactions referred to in the Transaction Documents will be enforced as written; 

m. that no action, discretionary or otherwise,
will be taken by or on behalf of the Company in the future that might result in a violation of law; 

n. that there are no other agreements or
understandings among the parties that would modify the terms of the Transaction Documents or the respective rights or obligations
of the parties to the Transaction Documents; 

o. that with respect to the Transaction
Documents and to the transactions referred to therein, there has been no mutual mistake of fact and there exists no fraud or duress;
and 

p. the constitutionality and validity of
all relevant laws, regulations and agency actions unless a reported case has otherwise held or widespread concern has been expressed
by commentators as reflected in materials which lawyers routinely consult. 

Based on the foregoing,
and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 

1. The Company is a
corporation existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company is duly qualified to transact business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to qualify could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                                         system (  DWAC  ) if the Company is then a participant in such system

                                         Exercise Price as set forth above (such date, the   Warrant Share Delivery Date  ).
                                         The Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person
                                         so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of
                                         such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant has been exercised, with payment
                                         to the Company of the Exercise Price and all taxes required to be paid by the Holder,
                                         if any, pursuant to Section 2(c)(vi) prior to the issuance of such shares, having been
                                         paid. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder certificates evidencing
                                         the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date,
                                         the Company shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty,
                                         for each $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise (based on the VWAP (as defined
                                         below) of the Common Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10 per
                                         Trading Day (increasing to $20 per Trading Day on the fifth Trading Day after such liquidated
                                         damages begin to accrue) for each Trading Day after such Warrant Share Delivery Date
                                         until such certificates are delivered.   VWAP   means, as of any particular
                                         date: (a) the volume weighted average of the closing sales prices of the Common Stock
                                         for such day on all domestic securities exchanges on which the Common Stock may at the
                                         time be listed; (b) if there have been no sales of the Common Stock on any such exchange
                                         on any such day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices for the Common
                                         Stock on all such exchanges at the end of such day; (c) if on any such day the Common
                                         Stock is not listed on a domestic securities exchange, the closing sales price of the
                                         Common Stock as quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. or similar quotation
                                         system or association for such day; or (d) if there have been no sales of the Common
                                         Stock on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. or similar quotation system or
                                         association on such day, the average of the highest bid and lowest asked prices for the
                                         Common Stock quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. or similar quotation
                                         system or association at the end of such day; in each case, averaged over twenty (20)
                                         consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately prior to the day as of
                                         which  VWAP  is being determined. If at any time the Common Stock is not
                                         listed on any domestic securities exchange or quoted on the the OTCQB tier of the OTC
                                         Markets Group, Inc. or similar quotation system or association, the  VWAP 
                                         of the Common Stock shall be the fair market value per share as determined jointly by
                                         the Board of Directors acting in good faith.    

ii.  Delivery
of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the certificate or certificates representing Warrant
Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called
for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant.  

iii.  Rescission
Rights . If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the certificates representing
the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2(c)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind
such exercise.  

iv.  Compensation
for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Exercise . In addition to any other rights available to the Holder,
if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or the certificates representing the
Warrant Shares pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required
by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases,
shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving
upon such exercise (a   Buy-In  ), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by
which (x) the Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so
purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver
to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase
obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number
of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to
the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise
and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000
to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to
such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay
the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect
of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s
right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares
of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.  

v.  No
Fractional Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise
of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the
Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction
multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share.  

vi.  Charges,
Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of certificates for Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or
transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall
be paid by the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed
by the Holder;  provided ,  however , that in the event certificates for Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other
than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto
duly executed by the Holder and the Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse
it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of
any Notice of Exercise.  

vii.  Closing
of Books . The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of
this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.  

d)  Holder s
Exercise Limitations . The Company shall not affect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to
exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance
after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and
any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates), would beneficially own
in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares
of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of
Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned
by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other
securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion
or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. Except as
set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance
with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder
that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation
contained in this Section 2(d) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities
owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion
of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder s determination of whether this
Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion
of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation
to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
For purposes of this Section 2(d), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company s most recent periodic or annual report filed with
the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by
the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request
of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common
Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect
to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the
date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The   Beneficial Ownership Limitation  
shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon not less than 61 days  prior notice to the Company,
may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(d), provided that the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to
the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(d)
shall continue to apply. Any such increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61 st  day after such notice is
delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict
conformity with the terms of this Section 2(d) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent
with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to
properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this
Warrant.  

Section
3 .  Certain Adjustments .  

a)  Stock
Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable
in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon
exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification
of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding
immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that
the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become
effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution
and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.  

b)  Fundamental
Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly,
effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets
in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether
by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange
their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common
Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization
or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted
into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization,
recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group
acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person
or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share
purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a   Fundamental Transaction  ), then, upon any subsequent
exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon
such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard
to any limitation in Section 2(d) on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of shares of capital stock of the successor or
acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the   Alternate
Consideration  ) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation
in Section 2(d) on the exercise of this Warrant). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall
be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in
respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among
the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate
Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental
Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of
this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction
in which the Company is not the survivor (the   Successor Entity  ) to assume in writing all of the obligations
of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(b) pursuant
to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable
delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this
Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this
Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity)
equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations
on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise
price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant
to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such
exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of
such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of
any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date
of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents referring to the  Company 
shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the
obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity
had been named as the Company herein.  

c)  Calculations .
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.  

d)  Notice
to Holder .  

i.  Adjustment
to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall
promptly mail to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the
number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.  

ii.  Notice
to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the
Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the
Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares
of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection
with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last
address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days prior to the applicable record
or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of
the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined
or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become
effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange
their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing
thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any
notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company or any of the Subsidiaries,
the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K if the Company
is then subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Holder shall remain entitled to
exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering such
notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.  

Section
4 .  Transfer of Warrant .  

a)  Transferability .
This Warrant and all rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration rights) are transferable, in whole or in
part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment
of this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient
to pay any transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company
shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination
or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion
of this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. The Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance
herewith, may be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued.  

b)  New
Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of
the Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed
by the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such
division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants
to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the initial
issuance date of this Warrant and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant
thereto.  

c)  Warrant
Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the   Warrant
Register  ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered
Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder,
and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.  

Section
5 .  Miscellaneous .  

a)  No
Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights, dividends or other rights
as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(c)(i).  

b)  Loss,
Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant
Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case
of the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate,
if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation,
in lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate.  

c)  Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required
or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
Business Day.  

d)  Authorized
Shares .  

The
Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common
Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights
under this Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers
who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for the Warrant
Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be
necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation,
or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant
Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase
rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof
(other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue).  

Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of the Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above
the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares
upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions
or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform
its obligations under this Warrant.  

Before
taking any action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or
in the Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be
necessary from any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof.  

e)  Jurisdiction .
All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.  

f)  Restrictions .
The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will have restrictions
upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws.  

g)  Nonwaiver
and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate
as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies. Without limiting any other provision
of this Warrant or the Purchase Agreement, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant,
which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to
cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys  fees, including those of appellate proceedings,
incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies
hereunder.  

h)  Notices .
Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered
in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement.  

i)  Limitation
of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase
Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder
for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company.  

j)  Remedies .
The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled
to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation
for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert
the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.  

k)  Successors
and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and
shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.  

l)  Amendment .
This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and holders holding
Warrants to acquire 67% of the Warrant Shares issuable pursuant to the Warrants that were issued under the Purchase Agreement.  

m)  Severability .
Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions
of this Warrant.  

n)  Headings .
The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of
this Warrant.
