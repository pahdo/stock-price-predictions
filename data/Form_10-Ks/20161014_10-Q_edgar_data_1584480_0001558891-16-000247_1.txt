   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   August

NOTE
A   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

A
summary of significant accounting policies of UpperSolution.com (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the
Company s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying
financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company s management who are
responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business
purpose.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
unaudited financial statements for the period ended August 31, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) Regulation S-X rule 8-03. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same
basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary
to present fairly the financial position as of August 31, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the period then
ended. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim financial statements related to the period
are unaudited. The results for the three months ended August 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for any subsequent quarters or for the entire year ending May 31, 2017. The balance sheet at May 31, 2016 has been derived from
the audited financial statements at that date.  

Organization,
Nature of Business and Trade Name   

UpperSolution.com
(the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 20, 2013 with the principal business objective of developing and
marketing apps.  

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to
operationalize the Company s apps before another company develops similar apps.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  A change in managements  estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on UpperSolution.com s
financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. UpperSolution.com s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary
for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.  

Capital
Stock   

The
Company has authorized seventy-five million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Currently, there were
fourteen million (14,000,000) shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of August 31, 2016.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net
income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss Per Share   

Net
loss per share is calculated in accordance with Codification topic 260,  Earnings Per Share  for the periods presented.
Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share has
not been presented because there are no dilutive items. Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive
stock options, warrants, and convertible debt are converted or exercised by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method,
options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds
obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Options, warrants and/or convertible
debt will have a dilutive effect, during periods of net profit, only when the average market price of the common stock during
the period exceeds the exercise or conversion price of the items. The Company has not issued any options or warrants or similar
securities since inception.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In
August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern
and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on
its financial statements.  

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its EITF), the AICPA, and the SEC did not or are not believed by
management to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the
price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded
at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based
risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent
in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the
lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:  

Level
1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2   Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level
3   Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  

In
accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.  

As
of August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016, the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at fair
value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.    

NOTE
B   GOING CONCERN   

The
Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
However, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues
sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.  

Under
the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither
the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described
in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

During
the next year, the Company s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its
business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
payment of expenses associated with research and development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise
additional capital.  

Historically,
it has mostly relied upon funds from the sale of shares of stock and from acquiring loans to finance its operations and growth.
Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company s stock or through loans
from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company s
failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.  

In
the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming
year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates
enough revenues through the operations as stated above.  

NOTE
C   COMMON STOCK   

On
or about May 20, 2013, Mahmoud Dasuka and Yousef Dasuka each purchased 5,750,000 common share of the company s common
stock for $5,750 each at $0.001 per share.  

During

During
the month of June 2015, the Company issued 1,500,000 common shares for $30,000 in cash at an issue price of $0.02.  

During
the month of July 2015, the Company issued 395,000 common shares for $7,900 in cash at an issue price of $0.02.  

As

NOTE
D   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

On
or about May 20, 2013, directors of the company Mahmoud Dasuka and Yousef Dasuka each purchased 5,750,000 common share of the
company s common stock for $5,750 each at $0.001 per share.  

On
March 16, 2014, Company received loans from a shareholder of $207. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.  

On
July 18, 2014, Company received loans from a shareholder of $1,800. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.  

The
balance due to the shareholder was $2,007 as of August 31, 2016.  

NOTE
E   INCOME TAXES   

Due
to the Company s net loss from inception on April 20, 2013 to August 31, 2016 there was no provision for income taxes recorded.
As a result of the Company s losses to date, there exists doubt as to the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets.
Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the total deferred tax assets has been recorded at August 31, 2016.  

The
components of net deferred tax assets are as follows:  

Income tax provision at the federal statutory rate    
        35  %  
 
     Effect on operating losses    
        (35  )%  

Changes
in the net deferred tax assets consist of the following:  

A
reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate is as follows:  

The
Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions.  The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for
unrecognized tax benefits.  

NOTE
F   OFFICE   

We
currently utilize office space at 153 W. Lake Mead #2240, Henderson, NV 89015, as our corporate registered office at a cost of
$150 per year (with such fee beginning in the second year). Most of the company s business is undertaken at the homes of
the officers and directors and such space is provided free of charge. We believe these facilities are in good condition, but that
we may need to expand our leased space as our expansion efforts increase.  

NOTE
G   SUBSEQUENT EVENT   

The
Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after August 31, 2016 through the date of this filing. The Company
determined that it does not have any other subsequent event requiring recording or disclosure in the financial statements for
the three months ended August 31, 2016.

2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations   

THE
FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THAT APPEAR ELSEWHERE
IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT REFLECT OUR PLANS, ESTIMATES AND BELIEFS.
OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR
CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

Certain
statements made in this report may constitute  forward-looking statements  on our current expectations and projections
about future events  . These forward-looking statements involve known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  In some cases you can identify forward-looking
statements by terminology such as  may,   should,   potential,   continue,   expects, 
 anticipates,   intends,   plans,   believes,   estimates,  and similar
expressions. These statements are based on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks
and uncertainties.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected-in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we
cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  These forward-looking statements are made
as of the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new
information, future events, or otherwise, other than as required by law. In light of these assumptions, risks, and uncertainties,
the forward-looking events discussed in this report might not occur and actual results and events may vary significantly from
those discussed in the forward-looking statements .  

Overview   

UpperSolution.com
is incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on April 20, 2013 and our fiscal year end is May 31, and we have no subsidiaries.  

Our
business is to create an independent and unbiased mobile app that enables consumers to find the best cellular rate plan for their
need and getting real-time notifications when a new cellular plan is available.  

We
are in the development stage of developing and commercializing a mobile app for existing cellular phone users. Our goal is to
help consumers to save money each month by notifying them when a more cost-effective plan based on their actual usage is available.  

Our
mobile app, to be named  Upper Plan Monitor ( UPM ) , will help consumers to keep track on new cellular
plans from different cellular carriers, locate the closest phone dealer their your area, find the best cellular phone plan that
fit their needs.  

Once
developed, UPM will eliminate the need to manually check if a better cellular phone plan is available with the current cellular
carrier or other cellular carriers. Convenience and money-savings will be our main selling features. We plan to develop UPM for
the Apple's iPhone phones, in the future if resources we allow us we will develop an app for an Android based mobile phones.  

When
a user launches the UPM app for the first time on his phone, he will be asked to select his existing cellular plan from a pre-loaded
list, in case that the user can t find his cellular plan he will be able to enter his existing cellular plan by minutes,
data and text message. Then the user will be asked to choose what is the most important to him in a cellular plan, and rate 3
features: talk, data and text. At this point UPM will gather this information and build a profile on the user based on his existing
cellular phone plan and his own preferences. The last step will be to choose the carriers he would like to get notifications when
new plans are available.  

UPM
will run in the background and automatically checks if a new cellular plan is available, in case that a new plan is available
it will match the 3 parameters (talk, data and text messages) to the users existing plan. In the case that the new plan is better
or cheaper than the current plan a pop-up notification will appear on the user s screen to notify him.  

At
this stage in our development, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in generating revenues from our app or that
existing phone users will be receptive to our application.  

Revenue
Model     

We
plan to generate revenue from the following sources:  

Sale
of UPM     

We
plan to sell UPM on Apple s App Store site, for $1.99. Apple takes 30 percent of all revenue generated through apps, and
70 percent goes to the app publisher.  

In-App
Ads     

One
of the major benefits of advertising on an app is that advertisers can take advantage of the users' geographic and demographic
information and target their ads appropriately. We plan to use Admob by Google as a way to insert advertisements into our app.
AdMob is one of the world's largest mobile advertising networks, and offers the ability for app developers to earn revenue by
publishing ads in their software. Revenue is generated according to the PPC (Pay Per Click) model, where advertisers pay the hosting
service a flat rate each time the ad is clicked.

Revenues    

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 we have not generated any revenue.  

Operating
Expenses     

The
Company s operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2016 is $3,635 and for the three month ended August 31,
2015 is $4,924. Operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2016 consist of General and Administrative expenses $1,135
and Professional Fees $2,500. Operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2015 consists of General and Administrative
expenses $624 and Professional Fees $4,300.  

Net
Loss   

During
the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 the Company recognized net losses of $3,635 and $4,924, respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

On
August 31, 2016, we had total current assets of $6,500 which consist of 6,500 in Cash and total current liabilities of $5,757
which consist of $3,750 in accounts payable and $2,007 in loan from shareholder.  

Historically,
we have financed our cash flow and operations from the sale of common stock and loan from related party.  Net cash provided
by financing activities for the three months ended August 31, 2016 was $0. During the three months ended August 31, 2015 net cash
provided by financing activities was $37,900, which consists of proceeds from issuance of common stock $37,900.  

We
have not yet generated any revenue from our operations. We will require additional funds to fully implement our plans. These funds
may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership
of our shares. We currently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when
required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing, a successful marketing and promotion program and, further
in the future, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in
a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would
be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.   We will require additional funds to
maintain our reporting status with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Nevada.  

Going
Concern   

We
have incurred net loss since our inception on April 20, 2013 through August 31, 2016 totaling $54,657 and have completed only
the preliminary stages of our business plan.  We anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues
and will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability.  Our
ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is
uncertain.  Accordingly, our independent auditors  report on our financial statements for the year ended May 31,
2016 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional
information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure.  The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

We
do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our net results of
operations, financial position, or cash flows.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

As
required by Rule 13a-15/15d-15 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of
August 31, 2016, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Company's disclosure
controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Company's management,
our President (Principal Executive Officer) and Treasurer (Principal Accounting Officer). Based upon the results of that evaluation,
our management has concluded that, as of August 31, 2016, our Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
and do not provide reasonable assurance that material information related to our Company required to be disclosed in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions
on required disclosure.  

MANAGEMENT'S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management
and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that:  

Pertain
                                         to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
                                         the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;    

Provide
                                         reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
                                         of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
                                         the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
                                         made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
                                         and    

Provide
                                         reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
                                         use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
                                         statements.    

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 . In making this assessment,
we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in INTERNAL CONTROL
-- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.  

Our
management concluded that, as of August 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria
in INTERNAL CONTROL -- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by the COSO.  

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's independent registered
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual
report.  

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above
during the first quarter ended August 31, 2016 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
controls over financial reporting.
