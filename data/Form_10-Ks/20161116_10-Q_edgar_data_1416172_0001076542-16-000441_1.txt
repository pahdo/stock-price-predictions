       Nature
    of Organization    

Operations  

Nexeon MedSystems Inc (the  Company )
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 7, 2015. The Company s primary purpose is to commercialize the drug-eluting
balloon technology acquired in the acquisition of Nexeon MedSystems, Inc., a private Delaware corporation ( NXDE )
primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of a unique series of breakthrough therapies for people with cardiovascular
disease, as further described in   Note 4   Acquisition  , below, as well as acquire medical device manufacturing
capability. 

Note
    2.   
       Basis
    of Presentation    

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s
management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring
accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows
for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company and NXDE, and related notes thereto, for the
period ended December 31, 2015 included in the Form 10 Registration Statement of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on October 5, 2016.  

Note
    3.   
       Going
    Concern    

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a
going concern. However, the Company has not commenced operations and has an accumulated a deficit of $821,250 as of September
30, 2016. The Company currently has limited liquidity, and has not completed its efforts to establish a source of revenues sufficient
to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management expects to seek potential business
opportunities for merger or acquisition of existing companies. Management is not currently limiting their search for merger or
acquisition candidates to any industry or locations. Management, while not especially experienced in matters relating to public
company management, will rely upon their own efforts and, to a much lesser extent, the efforts of the Company s shareholders,
in accomplishing the business purposes of the Company. 

Note
    4.   
       Acquisition    

On February 16, 2016, NXDE entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger ( Merger Agreement ) with the Company, pursuant to which NXDE was acquired by the Company,
with the Company continuing as the surviving entity. The transaction is being accounted for as a business combination. The primary
reason for the acquisition of NXDE was to acquire unique intellectual property owned by NXDE and technical knowledge retained
by NXDE and to further develop these technologies for potential commercialization. The foregoing transaction is referred to herein
as the  Merger.  The effective date of the Merger was February 16, 2016 and 100% of the equity voting interest was
acquired.

       Acquisition
    (Continued)    

In exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding
preferred stock of NXDE, immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, the Company issued 1,659,943 shares of common stock to
the preferred stockholders of NXDE. As a result of the Merger, the stockholders of the NXDE acquired 9.67% of the Company's issued
and outstanding common stock as of the effective date of the Merger. 

In addition, the Merger Agreement provides
for the conversion of debt of NXDE under the provisions of the Private Placement of the Company. See   Note 8, Equity   for
details on the Private Placement. 

The Merger Agreement further provides for
the payment of a royalty to a limited liability company to be formed by the former preferred shareholders of NXDE (the  Royalty ).
The Royalty payment is equal to 3% of net product sales made by the Company that directly result from the patent portfolio of
NXDE and has a term coinciding with the term of the Company s patent portfolio. 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company
exchanged $645,000 in NXDE stockholder loans and $176,482 in accrued interest related to those loans for 821,482 Units in the
Private Placement, each Unit consisting of one share of restricted common stock and one common stock purchase warrant. $202,825
in accrued interest related to those loans was cancelled. See   Note 8, Equity   for additional information regarding
the Private Placement. 

The Company considered the consideration
in accordance with ASC 845 Nonmonetary transaction whereby assets acquired in exchange for another nonmonetary asset is the fair
value of the assets surrendered or received, whichever is more clearly evident. Due to the lack of trading activity of the Company s
common stock surrendered in the acquisition, the Company has determined that the fair value of the assets acquired, less liabilities
assumed of NXDE is a more clearly evident value of the consideration transferred in the acquisition. 

The aggregate fair market value of
the consideration issued, $4,357,903, was determined based on the fair market value of the assets received in the acquisition
less the liabilities assumed through the acquisition. 1,659,943 shares of the Company's par value $.001 common stock were transferred
for all the issued and outstanding preferred stock of NXDE. 

The following table shows the allocation
of the purchase price of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Note 5.   
       Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies    

Development Stage Company  

The Company is considered to be in the development
stage as defined in ASC 915   Development Stage Entities.   The Company is devoting substantially all of its
efforts to the development of its business plans. The Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update
No. 2014-10,  Development Stage Entities  (Topic 915):  Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements ; and
does not present or disclose inception-to-date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 

Income Taxes  

The Company uses the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,   Income Taxes.   Under this method, income
tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences
of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance
is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence,
it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company has no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods
presented. 

All tax positions are first analyzed to determine
if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained under audit,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. After the initial analysis, the tax benefit is measured as
the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 

If the Company is required to pay interest
on the underpayment of income taxes, the Company recognizes interest expense in the first period the interest becomes due according
to the provisions of the relevant tax law. 

If the Company is subject to payment of penalties,
the Company recognizes an expense for the amount of the statutory penalty in the period when the position is taken on the income
tax return. If the penalty was not recognized in the period when the position was initially taken, the expense is recognized in
the period when the Company changes its judgment about meeting minimum statutory thresholds related to the initial position taken.

Note 5.   
       Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies    (Continued)   

Fair Value Measurements  

The Company adopted the provisions of ASC
Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,   which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting
pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. 

The estimated fair value of certain financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because
of the short-term nature of these instruments. 

ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also
establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1   quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities 

 Level 2   quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 

 Level 3   inputs that are unobservable
(for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) 

The Company currently has no assets or liabilities
valued at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Principals of Consolidation  

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All material inter-company accounts,
transactions, and profits have been eliminated in consolidation 

Investments in Non-Consolidated
Subsidiaries  

Investments in non-consolidated
entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and/or the Company's ability
to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. When the equity method is used, investments
are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize the Company's proportionate share of the investees' net income
or losses after the date of investment. When net losses from an investment accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying
amount, the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional losses are not provided for. The Company resumes accounting for
the investment under the equity method if the entity subsequently reports net income and the Company's share of that net income
exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended. Investments are written down
only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred. The Company accounts for
its investments in Nuviant Medical Inc., MicroTransponder, Inc., and Emeritus Clinical Solutions, Inc., formerly known as Telemend
Medical, Inc. under the cost method due to the lack of significant influence (see   Note 8, Equity  ).

       Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies    (Continued)   

Long-lived Assets  

Long-lived assets
such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based
on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar
assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable
from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value
of the asset. When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted
at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets. The Company did not recognize any impairment
losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Common Stock Purchase Warrants
and Other Derivative Financial Instruments  

The Company classifies
as equity any contracts that require physical settlement or net-share settlement or provide us a choice of net-cash settlement
or settlement in our own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) provided that such contracts are indexed to our
own stock as defined in ASC 815-40   Contracts in Entity's Own Equity.   We classify as assets or liabilities any
contracts that require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if
that event is outside our control) or give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical
settlement or net-share settlement). We assess classification of our common stock purchase warrants at each reporting date to
determine whether a change in classification between assets and liabilities is required .  

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements
are amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset and such expense is included in depreciation
expense. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes all furniture and equipment with cost
greater than $500 and benefiting more than one accounting period in the period purchased. 

Research and Development  

The Company expenses all research and development
costs as incurred.   Research and development expenses include, but are not limited to, product development, clinical
and regulatory expenses, payroll and other personnel expenses, materials, supplies, and consulting costs. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company recognized stock-based administrative
compensation aggregating $169,867 for common stock options and common stock issued to administrative personnel and consultants
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company has considered recent accounting
pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA, and the SEC during the current reporting
period, and management believes that such pronouncements did not, or are not to have a material impact on the Company s
present or future consolidated financial statements.

Note 6.   
       Income Taxes    

The Company has approximately
$821,250 of net operating losses ( NOL ) carryovers to offset taxable income, if any, in future years which expire
in fiscal 2035. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making
this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax
asset relating to NOLs period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

       Management s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

The following management discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements and related notes which are included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with the audited
financial statements of the Company and NXDE, and related notes thereto, for the period ended December 31, 2015 included in our
Form 10 Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 5, 2016.  

Overview   

Nexeon Medsystems,
Inc. was incorporated on December 7, 2015. We are a development stage enterprise focusing on the development and commercialization
of physician-driven medical device innovations for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. We have never declared bankruptcy,
have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we
have not made any significant sale of assets. 

Our operations to date have been limited to
organizing and staffing our Company, in addition to limited research and development activities, our merger with NXDE, which includes
its patent portfolio, and organization of a private placement offering. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated
deficit of $821,250. Our net loss was $436,943 and $820,335 for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016, respectively,
compared with a net loss of $915 for the period between December 7, 2015 (inception) and December 31, 2015.   

We expect the Company will continue to incur
significant expenses and increasing operating losses in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to
invest in research and development and initiate the requisite clinical trials to receive regulatory approval for our medical devices
in both the United States and European Union. Additionally, if and when we initiate a launch of one or more of our products, we
expect to incur substantial commercialization expenses related to the manufacture and distribution, as well as sales and marketing,
of these products. Furthermore, upon the effectiveness of this registration statement, the Company will be subject to additional
costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.
Such financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event we require additional capital and are unable
to secure such funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development activities, as well as
any future commercialization of our products. 

Results of Operations  

Our results of operations reflect the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Revenue   

To date, the Company has not generated any
revenues and has financed our operations with net proceeds from the private placement of our common stock during the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company s ability to generate revenues will depend heavily on the successful completion
of the requisite clinical trials and studies necessary to achieve approval to begin marketing our contemplated medical devices
from the relevant regulatory authorities in the United States and European Union.    

Research   Development Activities    

Research and Development ( R D )
expenses consist of the costs associated with our research and discovery efforts related to the design and development of our
proposed medical devices. Primarily, R D expenses are expected to include, but may not be limited to: 

Facilities, laboratory
    supplies, equipment and related expenses;   

Employee-related expenses,
    which among other things includes salaries, benefits, travel, and stock-based compensation;   

External R D activities
    incurred under arrangements with third-parties such as contract research organizations, manufacturing organizations, consultants,
    and possibly a scientific advisory board; and   

License fees and other
    costs associated with securing and protecting IP.   

Table of Contents    

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company s research and development expenses were $46,869 and $63,459 respectively, primarily reflecting consultants
and materials and supplies. 

It is expected that the Company s R D
activities and related expenses will increase significantly in the future as we increase the scope and rate of such efforts and
begin more expensive development activities, including clinical trials and similar studies as required by the relevant regulatory
authorities in our targeted jurisdictions (i.e. the United States and European Union). 

The successful completion of the requisite
clinical trials and studies to bring our contemplated medical devices to the U.S. and E.U. markets is highly uncertain. We cannot
reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated costs of the related efforts, nor can we make any assurances as
to the period, if any, in which material net cash inflows from sales of our medical devices may commence. This uncertainty is
due to the numerous risks and variables associated with developing and marketing medical devices, including, but not limited to: 

The scope and degree
    of progress associated with our research and discovery efforts, as well as related development activities;   

The extent of expenses
    incurred in conjunction with the foregoing activities;   

The safety and efficacy
    of our medical device as compared to traditional treatment modalities;   

Our ability to articulate
    successfully the benefits of our medical device to medical professionals who will be responsible for introducing patients
    to our product;   

The results of anticipated
    clinical studies and trials as required by the relevant regulatory approval processes;   

The terms and timing
    of potential regulatory approvals, if any; and   

The expense of securing
    licenses to relevant IP and/or the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other IP rights
    that we either own outright or have licensed.   

Unfavorable developments with respect to any
of the foregoing could mean significant changes in the cost and timing associated with our ability to bring our medical device
to market and begin generating revenues. 

General   Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses generally
consist of salaries and similar costs associated with employees, including stock-based compensation expense. This category of
expenses may also include facility costs and professional fees related to (i) legal and patent services; (ii) capital formation;
(iii) investor and public relations services; and (iv) consulting and accounting services. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company s general and administrative expenses were $231,711 and $361,477, respectively. 

It is expected that our general and administrative
expenses will increase in the future as we expand our R D activities in pursuit of regulatory approval for our contemplated
medical device. Such a rise in expenses could result from: 

Increased number of
    employees;    

Expanded infrastructure;   

Higher legal and compliance
    costs;   

Increased complexity
    of our financial statements that could precipitate a rise in our bookkeeping and accounting costs;    

Higher insurance premiums;
    or   

Increased need for
    investor and public relation services.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Sources of Liquidity   

To date, the Company has not generated any
revenues. We have financed our operations to date through a private placement (the  Private Placement ) of our common
stock and from loans from the Company's largest shareholder, Rosellini Scientific LLC. As of September 30, 2016, we have received
$286,446 in net cash proceeds from the issuance of Units, consisting of one share of restricted common stock and one warrant to
purchase one additional share of restricted common stock, from the Private Placement (see   Part II, Item 2,  Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities,    below, for more information). The Company has extended its Private Placement
to December 31, 2016 and increased the offering for up to $5,500,000 million, including the $286,446 already raised as noted above,
providing for an additional $3,000,000 million in new capital that could be formed as part of the current offering. The Company
reserves the right to conclude its Private Placement prior to December 31, 2016. During the next 12 months, the Company may elect
to form additional debt or equity capital following the completion of the current Private Placement either by private placement
or a registered offering. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in completing any new debt and/or equity
financing or receive assignments of grants. In the event that the Company is unable to secure needed financing or is unable to
secure such financing on terms we find favorable, we may be forced to delay, limit, or terminate product development and/or future
product commercialization. 

Material changes in the financial condition
from December 31, 2015 include: 

The contribution on January 2, 2016 of various
securities with a fair market value of $322,360 for 15,000,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock. 

On February 16, 2016, the Company entered
into a Merger Agreement with Nexeon MedSystems, Inc, a private Delaware corporation ( NXDE ), issuing 1,695,943 shares
of the Company s par value $.001 common stock in exchange for all the outstanding preferred shares on NXDE and assuming
$1,772,478 of the NXDE s liabilities. As part of the Merger Agreement $821,482 of assumed stockholder loans and accrued
interest was converted for 821,482 shares of the Company s par value $0.001 common stock and $202,825 of assumed accrued
interest was cancelled. In subsequent transactions, the Company converted $466,082 of assumed stockholder loans and accrued interest
for 466,082 shares of the Company s par value $0.001 common stock. 

The Company initiated a private placement
of its Common Stock effective February 1, 2016 and extended through December 31, 2016. The private placement is for the sale of
5,500,000 Units at $1.00 per unit, each Unit consisting of one share of restricted common stock and one warrant to purchase one
additional share of restricted common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $2.00 per share and expire 36 months from
the expiration date of the Private Placement. As of the date of this filing, $2,159,446 Units had been subscribed for in cash.  

Future Financing; Continued Operations   

Until such time, if ever, as the Company can
generate substantial revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of future debt and equity financing,
as well as expected non-dilutive research grant awards. Besides certain grant awards, as described above, the Company does not
have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that the Company secures additional capital through the sale of convertible
debt or equity securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of any such securities we
issue may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. In cases where the
Company secures certain debt financing, if any such is available, we may become subject to certain covenants limiting or restricting
our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. In
the event the Company is unable to secure needed financing, or is unable to secure such financing on terms we find favorable,
we may be forced to delay, limit, or terminate product development and/or future commercialization of the same. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements,
including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support, or other
benefits.

Critical Accounting Policies   

Our management s discussion and analysis
of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which
were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements include some estimates
and assumptions that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an
on-going basis and discuss the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors.
Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment. Our consolidated financial
statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions. 

The Company s significant accounting
policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, above. See   Note 5, Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   which we believe set forth the most critical accounting policies to aid you in fully
understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. 

New Accounting Pronouncements  

Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. 

Item
    3.   
       Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

Our exposure to market
risks is limited to changes in interest rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to
manage market risk. We have no debt outstanding nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short-term
investments. Accordingly, we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time. 

Item
    4.   
       Controls
    and Procedures    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective due to the size and nature of the existing business operation. Given the size of our current operation and existing
personnel, the opportunity to implement internal control procedures that segregate accounting duties and responsibilities is limited.
Until the organization can increase in size to warrant an increase in personnel, formal internal control procedure will not be
implemented until they can be effectively executed and monitored. As a result of the size of the current organization, there will
not be significant levels of supervision, review, independent directors nor formal audit committee. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

       Unregistered
    Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds    

Set forth below is an enumeration of all securities
issued by the Company since December 7, 2015, (inception) that have not been registered under the Securities Act. 

On February 16, 2016,
the Company merged with Nexeon MedSystems, Inc. ( NXDE )   a Delaware corporation. The Company, a Nevada corporation,
was the surviving entity. The Company converted 100% of NXDE s issued and outstanding common and preferred stock into 1,659,943
shares of the Company s common stock. 

This merger was unanimously
approved at a meeting of NXDE s common and preferred shareholders, all of whom are  Accredited Investors  as
defined by Rule 501 of SEC Regulation D. Based on these facts, we believe the issuance of Company common stock to the NXDE common
and preferred shareholders qualifies as a Section 4(2) exemption from registration.  

As part of the Merger
Agreement with NXDE, Dr. Mark Bates, M.D, the Company s Chief Innovation Officer, and Director, received a total of 386,212
shares of the Company s Common Stock upon conversion of the NXDE preferred shares, and converted $370,000 of debt owed to
him by NXDE into 370,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 370,000 additional shares of common stock at a strike
price of $2.00 per share and with a term of 36 months. In addition, Dr. Bates contributed $202,825 of accrued interest on his
debt, which will be reflected as additional paid in capital to the Company during the first quarter of 2016.  Dr. Bates,
beginning May 1, 2016, will receive a monthly consulting fee of $3,500.00.  

As part of the Merger
Agreement with NXDE, Mr. Ralph Ballard, who was a co-founder and Director of NXDE, received a total of 123,759 shares of the Company s
Common Stock upon conversion of the NXDE preferred shares, which were divided as follows: 1,398 shares to Mr. Ballard personally,
7,691 shares to a Custodial IRA FBO Ralph Ballard, and 114,670 shares to Ballard Investments. In addition, as part of the Merger
Agreement with NXDE, Mr. Ballard converted $451,482 of debt owed to him by NXDE and received 451,482 shares of our common stock
and warrants to purchase 451,482 shares at a strike price of $2.00 per share with a term of 36 months, which shares and warrants
were issued to Ballard Investments. Mr. Ballard has the power to vote and dispose of the shares held by his IRA and Ballard Investments.
In addition, three trusts representing three of Mr. Ballard s children converted a total of $431,821 of debt and received
431,821 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 431,821 shares of common stock at a strike price of $2.00 per share
with a term of 36 months, divided between and issued to the three trusts. The three trusts are irrevocable trusts managed by an
arms-length third party professional fiduciary. Mr. Ballard disclaims any beneficial ownership in the common stock and warrants
issued to the three trusts. 

Subsequent to the Merger, three additional
NXDE Shareholders converted a total of $34,261 in debt for 34,261 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 34,261 shares
of our common stock at a strike price of $2.00 per share with a term of 36 months. 

Subsequent to the
Merger, Rosellini Scientific LLC exchanged a $175,000 promissory note with a term of five years bearing an annual interest rate
of 8%, payable to Rosellini Scientific by Emeritus Clinical Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to the Company, in return
for 175,000 shares of the Company s common stock and warrants to purchase 175,000 shares of common stock with a strike price
of $2.00 per share with a term of 36 months. This transaction was rescinded as of June 30, 2016 and the shares were returned. 

On December 15, 2015,
the Company issued 500,000 shares of its common stock to its Chief Operating Officer for the sum of $500 at the par value of $0.001.
212,000 shares of the 500,000 shares became vested upon issue and the remaining 288,000 shares shall vest over a 36 month period
at the rate of 8,000 shares per month. Vesting began on January 1, 2016.

On January 1, 2016,
the Company issued 252,000 shares of common stock to Christopher Miller, with a par value of $0.001, for certain accounting and
budget-related services rendered as well as serving as Interim CFO until such time as a permanent CFO is hired. The shares vest
over a 36 month period at the rate of 7,000 shares per month. 

On January 2, 2016,
the Company issued 1,800,000 shares of its common stock to its Vice President of Clinical Affairs, Dr. Elizabeth Rosellini DDS
(the sister of our CEO), in return for 214 shares of common stock of Emeritus Clinical Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
and 60,000 shares of common stock of Nuviant Medical, Inc., a Nevada corporation. 

On January 2, 2016,
the Company entered into a Contribution Agreement with Rosellini Scientific, LLC   a company controlled by our CEO, William
Rosellini   and its wholly-owned subsidiary Belltower Associates, LLC (collectively, Rosellini Scientific, LLC and Belltower
Associates, LLC are hereinafter referred to as  RS ). Under this agreement, the Company issued 13,200,000 shares of
its common stock in return for, among other consideration: 

i.  
      RS s agreement
    to an assignment (subject to regulatory transfer approval) to the Company of Phase II, should it be granted of the Federal
    NIH/SBIR awarded Grant #1R44HL129870-01;   

iii.  
      167 shares of common
    stock of MicroTransponder, Inc., a Delaware corporation; and   

iv.  
      175 shares of common
    stock of Emeritus Clinical Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation.   

These transactions were valued based on the
value of the contributed assets as the Company s shares had no ascertainable value as of the date of issuance of the shares.
This was in accordance with ASC 845 Non-monetary transactions whereby non-monetary assets acquired in exchange for another non-monetary
asset is the fair value of the asset surrendered or received, whichever is more clearly evident. In this case the value of the
contributed assets were more ascertainable than the value of the shares issued. 

Prior to the contribution William Rosellini
was not a related party of the Company, but became a related party on January 2, 2016 through the issuance of the 13,200,000 shares
and a controlling interest in the Company. 

Mr. Rosellini, the CEO of the Company, is
the sole Member and Manager of Rosellini Scientific, LLC. 

Pursuant to the Company s Private Placement,
between March and October 2016, the Company issued 2,159,446 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 2,159,446 shares
of its common stock with a strike price of $2.00 per share and a term of 36 months, realizing aggregate cash proceeds of $2,159,446. 

On April 1, 2016,

with an exercise price of $1.00 with a term of three years to each of the following: Dr. Mark Bates MD; Dr. Elizabeth Rosellini
DDS; and Sheneka Rains (a consultant) for services rendered to the Company since inception as well as ongoing services to be provided
from time to time. The options vest in monthly increments of 7,000, with a three-year term for each option beginning upon each
date of vesting. 

Sheneka Rains is a full time employee of Rosellini
Scientific LLC. From time to time Ms Rains provides certain management and engineering services in the role of a consultant to
the Company. Currently Ms. Rains primary function is to plan, lead, and manage medical device programs, utilizing multi-disciplined
