1. Nature of Operations 
  Assurant, Inc. (the  Company ) is a holding company whose subsidiaries globally provide risk management solutions, protecting where consumers live and the goods they buy. 
  The Company is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AIZ." 
  Through its operating subsidiaries, the Company provides mobile device protection and related services; extended service contracts; vehicle protection; pre-funded funeral insurance; credit insurance; renters insurance; lender-placed homeowners insurance; mortgage valuation and field services and manufactured housing insurance.   
  As previously announced, the Company will substantially exit the health insurance market by the end of 2016 and sold its Assurant Employee Benefits segment on March 1, 2016 mainly through a series of reinsurance transactions with Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, a subsidiary of Sun Life Financial Inc. ( Sun Life ). See Notes 4 and 5, respectively, for more information. 
   
  2. Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 
  The interim financial data as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited; in the opinion of management, the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation. 
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and the rules and regulations thereunder (together, the  Affordable Care Act ) introduced new and significant premium stabilization programs in 2014. These programs require the Company to record amounts to our consolidated financial statements based on assumptions and estimates that have materially changed in prior periods as experience develops until the Company exits the Health business and settles related receivables. However, given the significant reduction in recoverables under the programs and remaining reserves as of September 30, 2016, the Company believes that such changes will no longer be material to the consolidated financial statements. 
  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
  3. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Adopted 
  On January 1, 2016 the Company adopted the amended guidance on presentation of debt issuance costs.  This amended guidance requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liabilities, consistent with debt discounts or premiums, as compared to previous guidance that required capitalization as a deferred asset.  The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by the amendments.  The adoption of this new presentation guidance did not impact the Company s financial position or results of operations.

On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the new consolidation guidance that affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. The adoption of this new consolidation guidance did not have an impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
  Not Yet Adopted 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended guidance on presentation and classification in the statement of cash flows. The amendments address certain specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon or insignificant coupon debt instruments; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and guidance related to the identification of the primary source for separately identifiable cash flows. The amended guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Therefore, the Company is required to adopt the guidance on January 1, 2018.  Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this amended presentation and classification guidance and the potential impact on the Company s statement of cash flows. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, the amended guidance eliminates the probable recognition threshold, and, instead requires an entity to reflect the current estimate of all expected credit losses. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses are measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, however the amended guidance requires that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a permanent impairment. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The amended guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Therefore, the Company is required to adopt the guidance on January 1, 2020.  Early adoption is permitted as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this amended credit losses guidance and the potential impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on accounting for employee share-based stock compensation. The updated guidance requires the excess tax benefit or deficiency on vesting or settlement of awards to be recognized in earnings as income tax benefit or expense, respectively.  This recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies will result in earnings volatility as current accounting guidance recognizes these amounts as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The excess tax benefits or deficiencies are discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur, and thus will not be considered in determining the annual estimated effective tax rate. The excess tax benefits or deficiencies will be presented as a cash flow within operating activities instead of within financing activities as is the case under current accounting.  The Company will adopt the updated guidance on January 1, 2017 and will recognize excess tax benefits or deficiencies in net income, as well as the related cash flows in operating activities, on a prospective basis.   The earnings impact of the adoption will depend on the excess tax benefits or deficiencies realized on vesting or settlement of awards resulting from the difference between the market value of awards at vesting or settlement and the grant date fair value. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on leases.  The new guidance will replace the current lease guidance. The new guidance requires that entities recognize the assets and liabilities associated with leases on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. The new guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Therefore, the Company is required to adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the requirements of this new lease guidance and the potential impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on the measurement and classification of financial instruments.  This amended guidance requires that all equity investments be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the fair value option

has been elected for financial liabilities.  The amendments eliminate the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, however public business entities will be required to use the exit price when measuring the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for disclosure purposes. In addition, the new guidance requires financial assets and financial liabilities to be presented separately in the notes to the financial statements, grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset. The amended guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Therefore, the Company is required to adopt the guidance on January 1, 2018.  For the provision related to presentation of financial liabilities, early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  The Company is evaluating the requirements of this amended measurement and classification of financial instruments guidance and the potential impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance on revenue recognition. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued implementation amendments to the May 2014 amended revenue recognition guidance. The amended guidance, including the implementation amendments (together, the  amended guidance ), affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. Insurance contracts are within the scope of other standards and therefore are specifically excluded from the scope of the amended revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the amended guidance is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve the core principle, the entity applies a five step process outlined in the amended guidance. The amended guidance also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements.  In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance to defer the effective date of the revenue recognition guidance. The amended guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Therefore, the Company is required to adopt the guidance on January 1, 2018. An entity can choose to apply the amended guidance using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the requirements of the revenue recognition guidance as it relates to its non-insurance contract revenue and the potential impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations. 
   
  4. Reorganization 
  As previously announced, the Company expects to substantially complete its exit from the health insurance market by the end of 2016. As part of this process, Assurant reinsured its supplemental and small-group self-funded lines of business and sold certain legal entities to National General Holdings Corp. ("National General"), effective October 1, 2015.

  (In thousands, except number of shares and per share amounts) 

The following table presents information regarding exit-related charges, commencing with those taken in the second quarter of 2015:   

  Amounts in the above table are primarily included in underwriting, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
  The total amount expected to be incurred is an estimate that is subject to change as facts and circumstances evolve. For instance, severance and retention estimates could change if employees previously identified for separation resign from the Company before the date through which they are required to be employed in order to receive severance and retention benefits. 
  The premium deficiency reserve liability decreased from   $79,422   at June 30, 2016 to   $57,860   at September 30, 2016. The decrease is consistent with the estimate of third quarter utilization expected at June 30, 2016. 
  Future cash payments, for these exit-related charges, are expected to be substantially complete by December 31, 2016, with remaining payments extending into 2018 as all final wind-down activities are completed.

5. Dispositions 
  On March 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Assurant Employee Benefits segment through a series of transactions with Sun Life, for net cash consideration of   $926,174   and contingent consideration of   $16,000   related to specified account renewals. The transaction was primarily structured as a reinsurance arrangement, as well as the sale of certain legal entities that included ceding commission and other consideration. The reinsurance transaction does not extinguish the Company's primary liability on the policies issued or assumed by subsidiaries that are parties to the reinsurance agreements, thus any gains associated with the prospective component of the reinsurance transaction are deferred and amortized over the contract period, including contractual renewal periods, in proportion to the amount of insurance coverage provided. The Company also has an obligation to continue to write and renew certain policies for a period of time until Sun Life commences policy writing and renewal.  
  The Company was required to allocate the proceeds considering the relative fair value of the transaction components, including the sale of certain legal entities, the reinsurance for existing claims (accounted for as retroactive reinsurance) and reinsurance for inforce policies with remaining terms and future business (primarily accounted for as prospective reinsurance). As of the close date, the Company originally estimated a gain of   $638,517   (which was subsequently increased to   $640,497   in the second quarter 2016 due to closing adjustments) based on proceeds compared to the relative net assets transferred and other expenses incurred along with realized gains on invested assets transferred. Of this amount,   $120,077   was recognized at the close of the transaction and   $518,440   (which was subsequently increased to   $520,420   in the second quarter due to closing adjustments) was required to be deferred. During the third quarter 2016, the condition for recognition of the   $16,000   contingent consideration was met and the Company received this additional cash consideration from Sun Life. The additional consideration was recognized as a realized gain, increasing the total adjusted gain to   $656,497  .  
  The total deferred gain amount will primarily be recognized as revenue over the contract period in proportion to the amount of insurance coverage provided, including estimated contractual renewals pursuant to rate guarantees. The Company recognized   $116,856   and   $284,284   of amortization of the deferred gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The total pre-tax gain recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was   $420,361  .  
  Approximately   70%   of the   $520,420   deferred gain related to this transaction (including the   $284,284   amortized through September 30, 2016) is expected to be earned in 2016 and over   90%   is expected to be earned by the end of 2018. The ultimate amortization pattern will be dependent on a number of factors including the exact timing of when Sun Life commences directly writing and renewing policies and the sales and persistency on business the Company is obligated to write and renew in the interim.

  (In thousands, except number of shares and per share amounts) 

The following represents a summary of the pre-tax gain recognized in 2016 by transaction component, as well as the related classification within the financial statements: 

(a) 
    Amount classified within underwriting, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
              (b) 
    Novations of certain insurance policies directly to Sun Life allowed for immediate gain recognition.  
              (c) 
    Reinsurance of existing claims liabilities requires retroactive accounting necessitating losses to be recognized immediately. However, upon transfer of the associated assets supporting the liabilities, the Company recognized realized gains which more than offset the retroactive losses. The Company was required to classify the realized gains as part of net realized gains on investments, within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
              (d) 
    Amount classified as amortization of deferred gains and gains on disposal of businesses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
              (e) 
    Amount classified as a component of the deferred gains on disposal of businesses within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
     The Company will review and evaluate the estimates affecting the deferred gain each period or when significant information affecting the estimates becomes known, and will adjust the prospective revenue to be recognized accordingly.  
  The Assurant Employee Benefits segment pretax income was   $16,747   and   $49,754   for the nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (excluding the aforementioned gains realized in 2016 which are included in the Corporate   Other segment).  
   
  6. Acquisitions 
  On July 1, 2016, the Company acquired   100%   of American Title, Inc., a leader in title and valuation services for home equity lenders. The acquisition-date fair value of the initial cash consideration totaled   $44,961  , with a possible earn-out payment based on future expected revenue and gross profits. The contingent payment was determined to have no initial value based on the Company's assessment that the underlying conditions would not be met. However, this may change over time, with any resulting adjustments recorded in earnings when a change in estimated payment is determined. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded   $32,356   of customer and technology-based intangible assets, all of which are amortizable over periods ranging from   1   to   12.5   years, and   $8,534   of goodwill, none of which is tax-deductible. The primary factor contributing to the recognition of goodwill is future expected growth of this business within Assurant Specialty Property.

On March 14, 2016, the Company acquired certain renewal rights to the National Flood Insurance Program block of business of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. The estimated acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled   $20,329  , which consists of an initial cash payment of   $1,000   and an expected contingent payment of   $19,329  . The contingent consideration arrangement is based on future expected revenue. In connection with this asset acquisition, the Company recorded   $20,329   of renewal rights intangible assets which are amortizable over a   five  -year period. The contingent payment may change over time, with any resulting adjustments recorded in earnings when a change in estimated payment is determined.

(a) 
    Represents the amount of OTTI recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ). Amount includes unrealized gains and losses on impaired securities relating to changes in the value of such securities subsequent to the impairment measurement date. 
       
  The Company's states, municipalities and political subdivisions holdings are highly diversified across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, with   no   individual state s exposure (including both general obligation and revenue securities) exceeding   0.5%   of the overall investment portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the securities include general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers, including   $224,255   and   $319,654  , respectively, of advance refunded or escrowed-to-maturity bonds (collectively referred to as  pre-refunded bonds ), which are bonds for which an irrevocable trust has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, revenue bonds account for   47%   and   50%   of the holdings, respectively. Excluding pre-refunded revenue bonds, the activities supporting the income streams of the Company s revenue bonds are across a broad range of sectors, primarily highway, water, airport and marina, higher education, specifically pledged tax revenues, and other miscellaneous sources such as bond banks, finance authorities and appropriations. 
  The Company s investments in foreign government fixed maturity securities are held mainly in countries and currencies where the Company has policyholder liabilities, which allow the assets and liabilities to be more appropriately matched. At September 30, 2016, approximately   78%  ,   11%   and   4%   of the foreign government securities were held in the Canadian government/provincials and the governments of Brazil and Germany, respectively. At December 31, 2015, approximately   79%  ,   8%   and   5%   of the foreign government securities were held in the Canadian government/provincials and the governments of Brazil and Germany, respectively. No other country represented more than   3%   of the Company's foreign government securities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
  The Company has European investment exposure in its corporate fixed maturity and equity securities of   $735,779   with a net unrealized gain of   $81,256   at September 30, 2016 and   $888,923   with a net unrealized gain of   $67,957   at December 31, 2015. Approximately   23%   and   25%   of the corporate European exposure is held in the financial industry at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company's largest European country exposure (the United Kingdom) represented approximately   4%   and   5%   of the fair value of the Company's corporate securities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Approximately   7%   of the fair value of the corporate European securities are pound and euro-denominated and are not hedged to U.S. dollars, but held to support those foreign-denominated liabilities. The Company's international investments are managed as part of the overall portfolio with the same approach to risk management and focus on diversification. 
  The Company has exposure to the energy sector in its corporate fixed maturity securities of   $670,295   with a net unrealized gain of   $60,856   at September 30, 2016 and   $779,720   with a net unrealized loss of   $6,985   at December 31, 2015. Approximately   85%   and   89%   of the energy exposure is rated as investment grade as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
  The cost or amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities at September 30, 2016 by contractual maturity are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers of the securities may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 
  The Company follows the OTTI guidance, which requires entities to separate an OTTI of a debt security into two components when there are credit related losses associated with the impaired debt security for which the Company asserts that it does not have the intent to sell, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell before recovery of its cost basis. Under the OTTI guidance, the amount of the OTTI related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings, and the amount of the OTTI related to other, non-credit factors (  e.g.  , interest rates, market conditions, etc.) is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. In instances where no credit loss exists but the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery, the decline in market value below amortized cost is recognized as an OTTI in earnings. In periods after the recognition of an OTTI on debt securities, the Company accounts for such securities as if they had been purchased on the measurement date of the OTTI at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings. For debt securities for which OTTI was recognized in earnings, the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected will be accreted or amortized into net investment income. 
  There was   no   OTTI recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded   $364   of OTTI, of which   $701   was related to both credit losses and securities the Company intends to sell and recorded as net OTTI losses recognized in earnings, with the remaining   $337   related to all other factors and was recorded as an unrealized gain component of AOCI. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded   $1,696   and   $4,904  , respectively, of OTTI, of which   $707   and   $3,277  , respectively, was related to both credit losses and securities the Company intends to sell and recorded as net OTTI losses recognized in earnings, with the remaining   $989   and   $1,627  , respectively, related to all other factors and was recorded as an unrealized loss component of AOCI.   
  The following table sets forth the amount of credit loss impairments recognized within the results of operations on fixed maturity securities held by the Company as of the dates indicated, for which a portion of the OTTI loss was recognized in AOCI, and the corresponding changes in such amounts.

The Company regularly monitors its investment portfolio to ensure investments that may be other-than-temporarily impaired are timely identified, properly valued, and charged against earnings in the proper period. The determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, whether any collateral is held, the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery for equity securities and the intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell for fixed maturity securities. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy, a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies, industry sectors, or countries could result in additional impairments in future periods for other-than-temporary declines in value. Any equity security whose price decline is deemed other-than-temporary is written down to its then current market value with the amount of the impairment reported as a realized loss in that period. The impairment of a fixed maturity security that the Company has the intent to sell or that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell is deemed other-than-temporary and is written down to its market value at the balance sheet date with the amount of the impairment reported as a realized loss in that period. For all other-than-temporarily impaired fixed maturity securities that do not meet either of these two criteria, the Company is required to analyze its ability to recover the amortized cost of the security by calculating the net present value of projected future cash flows. For these other-than-temporarily impaired fixed maturity securities, the net amount recognized in earnings is equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security and its net present value.     
  The Company considers different factors to determine the amount of projected future cash flows and discounting methods for corporate debt and residential and commercial mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities. For corporate debt securities, the split between the credit and non-credit losses is driven principally by assumptions regarding the amount and timing of projected future cash flows. The net present value is calculated by discounting the Company s best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition. For residential and commercial mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates, including prepayment assumptions, are based on data from widely accepted third-party data sources or internal estimates. In addition to prepayment assumptions, cash flow estimates vary based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including default rates, recoveries and changes in value. The net present value is calculated by discounting the Company s best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security prior to impairment at the balance sheet date. The discounted cash flows become the new amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. 
  In periods subsequent to the recognition of an OTTI, the Company generally accretes the discount (or amortizes the reduced premium) into net investment income, up to the non-discounted amount of projected future cash flows, resulting from the reduction in cost basis, based upon the amount and timing of the expected future cash flows over the estimated period of cash flows.

Total gross unrealized losses represent approximately   1%   and   5%   of the aggregate fair value of the related securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Approximately   36%   and   88%   of these gross unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The total gross unrealized losses are comprised of   239   and   884   individual securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In accordance with its policy described above, the Company concluded that for these securities an adjustment to its results of operations for other-than-temporary impairments of the gross unrealized losses was not warranted at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These conclusions were based on a detailed analysis of the underlying credit and expected cash flows of each security. As of September 30, 2016, the gross unrealized losses that have been in a continuous loss position for twelve months or more were concentrated in the Company s U.S. and foreign corporate fixed maturity securities and in non-redeemable preferred stocks. The non-redeemable preferred stocks are perpetual preferred securities that have characteristics of both debt and equity securities. To evaluate these securities, the Company applies an impairment model similar to that used for the Company's fixed maturity securities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not intend to sell these securities and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell them and no underlying cash flow issues were noted. Therefore, the Company did not recognize an OTTI on those perpetual preferred securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not intend to sell the fixed maturity securities and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery of their amortized cost basis. The gross unrealized losses are primarily attributable to widening credit spreads associated with an underlying shift in overall credit risk premium. 
  The Company has entered into commercial mortgage loans, collateralized by the underlying real estate, on properties located throughout the U.S. and Canada. At September 30, 2016, approximately   34%   of the outstanding principal balance of commercial mortgage loans was concentrated in the states of California, Texas, and Oregon. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, an economic downturn could have an adverse impact on the ability of its debtors to repay their loans. The outstanding balance of commercial mortgage loans range in size from   $7   to   $12,671   at September 30, 2016 and from   $17   to   $14,625   at December 31, 2015. 
  Credit quality indicators for commercial mortgage loans are loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios. Loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the credit quality of commercial mortgage loans. The loan-to-value ratio compares the principal amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a percentage. The debt-service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to its debt-service payments and is commonly expressed as a ratio. The loan-to-value and debt-service coverage ratios are generally updated annually in the third quarter.

The following summarizes the Company's loan-to-value and average debt-service coverage ratios as of the dates indicated: 

All commercial mortgage loans that are individually impaired have an established mortgage loan valuation allowance for losses. An additional valuation allowance is established for incurred, but not specifically identified impairments. Changing economic conditions affect the Company's valuation of commercial mortgage loans. Changing vacancies and rents are incorporated into the discounted cash flow analysis that the Company performs for monitored loans and may contribute to the establishment of (or an increase or decrease in) a commercial mortgage loan valuation allowance for losses. In addition, the Company continues to monitor the entire commercial mortgage loan portfolio to identify risk. Areas of emphasis are properties that have exposure to specific geographic events, have deteriorating credits or have experienced a reduction in debt-service coverage ratio.  
  Commercial Mortgage Loan Securitization 
    
             On May 31, 2016, the Company transferred   $259,741   of certain commercial mortgage loans on real estate into a trust.  Upon transfer, the loans were securitized as a source of funding for the Company and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans to third parties. The securitized assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Company and are not available to satisfy its obligations. The securitization of the assets was accounted for as a sale. The securitized assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust. The Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the trust, nor does it provide guarantees or recourse to the trust other than standard representations and warranties. The Company retained an interest in the trust in the form of subordinate securities issued by the trust. The trust is a variable interest entity ("VIE") that the Company does not consolidate. 
    
  The cash proceeds, including accrued investment income, from the securitization were   $269,828  , with a corresponding realized gain of   $9,092  . At closing, the Company purchased   $30,822   of securities at fair value from the trust. As of September 30, 2016, the maximum loss exposure the Company has to the trust is   $29,709  . The Company calculates its maximum loss exposure based on the unlikely event that all the assets in the trust become worthless and the effect it would have on the Company s consolidated balance sheets based upon its retained interest in the trust. The securities purchased from the trust are included within fixed maturity securities available for sale at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet and are part of the

  Variable Interest Entities 
    
             A VIE is a legal entity which does not have sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support or in which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of a controlling financial interest. The Company's investments in VIEs include private equity limited partnerships and real estate joint ventures. These investments are generally accounted for under the equity method and included in the consolidated balance sheets in other investments. The Company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet in addition to any required unfunded commitments. As of September 30, 2016, the Company's maximum exposure to loss is   $284,379   in recorded carrying value and   $67,438   in unfunded commitments. See   Commercial Mortgage Loan Securitization   section above for the disclosures relating to the commercial mortgage loan securitization trust. 

8. Fair Value Disclosures 
  Fair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities Disclosures 
  The fair value measurements and disclosures guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with this guidance, the Company has categorized its recurring basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. 
  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and takes into account factors specific to the asset or liability. 
  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 
             
    Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access. 
                
    Level 2 inputs utilize other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the marketplace for the asset. The observable inputs are used in valuation models to calculate the fair value for the asset. 
                
    Level 3 inputs are unobservable but are significant to the fair value measurement for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset. These inputs reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset. 
     The Company reviews fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy.

    Transfers are primarily attributable to changes in the availability of observable market information and re-evaluation of the observability of pricing inputs. 
     Three different valuation techniques can be used in determining fair value for financial assets and liabilities: the market, income or cost approaches. The three valuation techniques described in the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance are consistent with generally accepted valuation methodologies. The market approach valuation techniques use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. When possible, quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets are used as of the period-end date (such as for mutual funds and money market funds). Otherwise, the Company uses valuation techniques consistent with the market approach including matrix pricing and comparables. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique employed principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for those securities but, rather, relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Market approach valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables. Multiples might lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable. The selection of where within the range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment, considering both qualitative and quantitative factors specific to the measurement. 
  Income approach valuation techniques convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. These techniques rely on current market expectations of future amounts as of the period-end date. Examples of income approach valuation techniques include present value techniques, option-pricing models, binomial or lattice models that incorporate present value techniques and the multi-period excess earnings method.    
  Cost approach valuation techniques are based upon the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset at the period-end date, or the current replacement cost. That is, from the perspective of a market participant (seller), the price that would be received for the asset is determined based on the cost to a market participant (buyer) to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. 
  While not all three approaches are applicable to all financial assets or liabilities, where appropriate, the Company may use one or more valuation techniques. For all the classes of financial assets and liabilities included in the above hierarchy, excluding

certain derivatives and certain privately placed corporate bonds, the Company generally uses the market valuation technique. For certain privately placed corporate bonds and certain derivatives, the Company generally uses the income valuation technique. For the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the application of the valuation technique applied to the Company s classes of financial assets and liabilities has been consistent. 
  Level 1 Securities 
  The Company s investments and liabilities classified as Level 1 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consisted of mutual funds and money market funds, foreign government fixed maturities and common stocks that are publicly listed and/or actively traded in an established market. 
  Level 2 Securities 
  The Company values Level 2 securities using various observable market inputs obtained from a pricing service. The pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for the Company s Level 2 securities using proprietary valuation models based on techniques such as matrix pricing which include observable market inputs. The fair value measurements and disclosures guidance defines observable market inputs as the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. The extent of the use of each observable market input for a security depends on the type of security and the market conditions at the balance sheet date. Depending on the security, the priority of the use of observable market inputs may change as some observable market inputs may not be relevant or additional inputs may be necessary. The Company uses the following observable market inputs ( standard inputs ), listed in the approximate order of priority, in the pricing evaluation of Level 2 securities: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research data. Further details for Level 2 investment types follow: 
  United States Government and government agencies and authorities:   U.S. government and government agencies and authorities securities are priced by the Company s pricing service utilizing standard inputs. Included in this category are U.S. Treasury securities which are priced using vendor trading platform data in addition to the standard inputs. 
  State, municipalities and political subdivisions:   State, municipalities and political subdivisions securities are priced by the Company s pricing service using material event notices and new issue data inputs in addition to the standard inputs. 
  Foreign governments:   Foreign government securities are primarily fixed maturity securities denominated in Canadian dollars which are priced by the Company s pricing service using standard inputs. The pricing service also evaluates each security based on relevant market information including relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. 
  Commercial mortgage-backed, residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed:   Commercial mortgage-backed, residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are priced by the Company s pricing service using monthly payment information and collateral performance information in addition to the standard inputs. Additionally, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities utilize new issue data while residential mortgage-backed securities utilize vendor trading platform data. 
  Corporate:   Corporate securities are priced by the Company s pricing service using standard inputs. Non-investment grade securities within this category are priced by the Company s pricing service using observations of equity and credit default swap curves related to the issuer in addition to the standard inputs. Certain privately placed corporate bonds are priced by a non-pricing service source using a model with observable inputs including, but not limited to, the credit rating, credit spreads, sector add-ons, and issuer specific add-ons.    
  Non-redeemable preferred stocks:   Non-redeemable preferred stocks are priced by the Company s pricing service using observations of equity and credit default swap curves related to the issuer in addition to the standard inputs. 
  Short-term investments, other investments, cash equivalents, and assets/liabilities held in separate accounts:   To price the fixed maturity securities in these categories, the pricing service utilizes the standard inputs.  
  Other assets:   A non-pricing service source prices foreign exchange forwards using a pricing model which utilizes market observable inputs including foreign exchange spot rate, forward points and date to settlement.

Valuation models used by the pricing service can change period to period, depending on the appropriate observable inputs that are available at the balance sheet date to price a security. When market observable inputs are unavailable to the pricing service, the remaining unpriced securities are submitted to independent brokers who provide non-binding broker quotes or are priced by other qualified sources. If the Company cannot corroborate the non-binding broker quotes with Level 2 inputs, these securities are categorized as Level 3 securities. 
  Level 3 Securities 
  The Company s investments classified as Level 3 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of fixed maturity and equity securities and derivatives. All of the Level 3 fixed maturity and equity securities are priced using non-binding broker quotes which cannot be corroborated with Level 2 inputs. Of the Company s total Level 3 fixed maturity and equity securities   $3,084   and   $304   were priced by a pricing service using single broker quotes due to insufficient information to provide an evaluated price as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The single broker quotes are provided by market makers or broker-dealers who are recognized as market participants in the markets in which they are providing the quotes. The remaining   $109,933   and   $65,600   were priced internally using independent and non-binding broker quotes as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The inputs factoring into the broker quotes include trades in the actual bond being priced, trades of comparable bonds, quality of the issuer, optionality, structure and liquidity. Significant changes in interest rates, issuer credit, liquidity, and overall market conditions would result in a significantly lower or higher broker quote. The prices received from both the pricing service and internally are reviewed for reasonableness by management and if necessary, management works with the pricing service or broker to further understand how they developed their price. Further details on Level 3 derivative investment types follow: 
  Other investments and other liabilities:   The Company prices swaptions using a Black-Scholes pricing model incorporating third-party market data, including swap volatility data. The Company prices credit default swaps using non-binding quotes provided by market makers or broker-dealers who are recognized as market participants. Inputs factored into the non-binding quotes include trades in the actual credit default swap which is being priced, trades in comparable credit default swaps, quality of the issuer, structure and liquidity. The net option related to the investment in Ik  is valued using an income approach; specifically, a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model. The inputs to the model include, but are not limited to, the projected normalized earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and free cash flow for the underlying asset, the discount rate, and the volatility of and the correlation between the normalized EBITDA and the value of the underlying asset. Significant increases (decreases) in the projected normalized EBITDA relative to the value of the underlying asset in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value. 
  Other assets:   A non-pricing service source prices certain derivatives using a model with inputs including, but not limited to, the time to expiration, the notional amount, the strike price, the forward rate, implied volatility and the discount rate. 
  Management evaluates the following factors in order to determine whether the market for a financial asset is inactive. The factors include, but are not limited to: 
             
    There are few recent transactions, 
                
    Little information is released publicly, 
                
    The available prices vary significantly over time or among market participants, 
                
    The prices are stale (i.e., not current), and 
                
    The magnitude of the bid-ask spread.  
       
  Illiquidity did not have a material impact in the fair value determination of the Company s financial assets. 
  The Company generally obtains one price for each financial asset. The Company performs a monthly analysis to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of their fair value. This process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by investment and accounting professionals. Examples of procedures performed include, but are not limited to, initial and on-going review of pricing service methodologies, review of the prices received from the pricing service, review of pricing statistics and trends, and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different appropriate price sources for reasonableness. Following this analysis, the Company generally uses the best estimate of fair value based upon all available inputs. On infrequent occasions, a non-pricing service source may be more familiar with the market activity for a particular security than the pricing service. In these cases the price used is taken from the non-pricing service source. The

pricing service provides information to indicate which securities were priced using market observable inputs so that the Company can properly categorize the Company s financial assets in the fair value hierarchy. 
  For the net option, the Company performs a periodic analysis to assess if the evaluated price represents a reasonable estimate of the fair value for the financial liability. This process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis overseen by finance and accounting professionals. Examples of procedures performed include, but are not limited to, initial and on-going review of the pricing methodology and review of the projection for the underlying asset including the probability distribution of possible scenarios. 
  Disclosures for Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
  The Company also measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities on a non-recurring basis, generally on an annual basis, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. These assets include commercial mortgage loans, goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets. 
  The Company utilizes both the income and market valuation approaches to measure the fair value of its reporting units when required. Under the income approach, the Company determined the fair value of the reporting units considering distributable earnings, which were estimated from operating plans. The resulting cash flows were then discounted using a market participant weighted average cost of capital estimated for the reporting units. After discounting the future discrete earnings to their present value, the Company estimated the terminal value attributable to the years beyond the discrete operating plan period. The discounted terminal value was then added to the aggregate discounted distributable earnings from the discrete operating plan period to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Under the market approach, the Company derived the fair value of the reporting units based on various financial multiples, including but not limited to: price to tangible book value of equity, price to estimated 2014 earnings and price to estimated 2015 earnings, which were estimated based on publicly available data related to comparable guideline companies. In addition, financial multiples were also estimated from publicly available purchase price data for acquisitions of companies operating in the insurance industry. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was more heavily weighted towards the income approach because in the current economic environment the earnings capacity of a business is generally considered the most important factor in the valuation of a business enterprise. This fair value determination was categorized as Level 3 (unobservable) in the fair value hierarchy. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments Disclosures 
  The financial instruments guidance requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate such fair value. Therefore, it requires fair value disclosure for financial instruments that are not recognized or are not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. However, this guidance excludes certain financial instruments, including those related to insurance contracts and those accounted for under the equity method (such as partnerships). 
  For the financial instruments included within the following financial assets and financial liabilities, the carrying value in the consolidated balance sheets equals or approximates fair value. Please refer to the Fair Value Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities Disclosures section above for more information on the financial instruments included within the following financial assets and financial liabilities and the methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value: 
             
    Cash and cash equivalents    
                
    Fixed maturity securities

In estimating the fair value of the financial instruments that are not recognized or are not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, the Company used the following methods and assumptions: 
  Commercial mortgage loans:   the fair values of mortgage loans are estimated using discounted cash flow models. The model inputs include mortgage amortization schedules and loan provisions, an internally developed credit spread based on the credit risk associated with the borrower and the U.S. Treasury spot curve. Mortgage loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations. 
  Policy loans:   the carrying value of policy loans reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value. 
  Other investments:   Other investments include equity investments accounted for under the cost method, Certified Capital Company and low income housing tax credits, business debentures, credit tenant loans and social impact loans which are recorded at cost or amortized cost. The carrying value reported for these investments approximates fair value. Due to the nature of these investments, there is a lack of liquidity in the primary market which results in the holdings being classified as Level 3. 
  Policy reserves under investment products:   the fair values for the Company s policy reserves under investment products are determined using discounted cash flow analysis. Key inputs to the valuation include projections of policy cash flows, reserve run-off, market yields and risk margins. 
  Funds held under reinsurance:   the carrying value reported approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments. 
  Debt:   the fair value of debt is based upon matrix pricing performed by the pricing service utilizing the standard inputs. The carrying value of the promissory note approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the instrument.

    Only the fair value of the Company s policy reserves for investment-type contracts (those without significant mortality or morbidity risk) are reflected in the table above. 
     Reinsurance Recoverables Credit Disclosures 
  A key credit quality indicator for reinsurance is the A.M. Best financial strength ratings of the reinsurer. The A.M. Best ratings are an independent opinion of a reinsurer s ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. The A.M. Best ratings for new reinsurance agreements where there is material credit exposure are reviewed at the time of execution. The A.M. Best ratings for existing reinsurance agreements are reviewed on a periodic basis, at least annually. The A.M. Best ratings have not changed significantly since December 31, 2015. 
  An allowance for doubtful accounts for reinsurance recoverables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers (net of collateral), reinsurer solvency, management s experience and current economic conditions.

Interest on the 2013 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on   March 15   and   September 15   of each year. The 2013 Senior Notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Company s other senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company may redeem each series of the 2013 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time and from time to time before their maturity at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture. The 2013 Senior Notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
  The interest expense and related amortization incurred related to the 2013 Senior Notes was   $5,947   and   $5,747   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $17,837   and   $17,240   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was   $948   of accrued interest at both September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company made interest payments on the 2013 Senior Notes of   $11,375   on March 15, 2016 and 2015 and September 15, 2016 and 2015.  
  In   February 2004  , the Company issued   two   series of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $975,000   (the  2004 Senior Notes ). The Company received proceeds of   $971,537   from this transaction, which represents the principal amount less the discount before offering expenses. The discount of   $3,463   is being amortized over the life of the 2004 Senior Notes and is included as part of interest expense on the statements of operations. The first series was   $500,000   in principal amount, issued at a   0.11%   discount, bore interest at   5.63%   per year and was repaid on   February 18, 2014  . The second series is   $475,000   in principal amount, bears interest at   6.75%   per year and is payable in a single installment due   February 15, 2034   and was issued at a   0.61%   discount. Interest on the 2004 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on   February 15   and   August 15   of each year. The 2004 Senior Notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Company s other senior unsecured indebtedness. The 2004 Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. All of the holders of the 2004 Senior Notes exchanged their notes in May 2004 for new notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
  The interest expense and related amortization incurred related to the 2004 Senior Notes was   $8,058   and   $8,032   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $24,172   and   $24,095   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Company made interest payments on the 2004 Senior Notes of   $16,031   on February 15, 2016 and 2015 and August 15, 2016 and 2015.  
  Promissory Note 
  On   March 4, 2016  , the Company entered into a private loan agreement in the form of a Promissory Note (the "Note") with a single financial institution, for an aggregate principal amount of   $250,000  . The Company received net proceeds of   $249,625   from this transaction, which represented the principal amount less fees.  Interest on the Note was a floating rate tied to LIBOR and was payable at least quarterly. The Note was payable in a single installment due   March 3, 2017  ; however, terms of the agreement required that the Company promptly repay the loan with any dividends received from Union Security Insurance Company and Union Security Life Insurance Company of New York, the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries that received the cash proceeds related to the sale of the Assurant Employee Benefits segment, or the issuance of debt or equity securities (other than in connection with employee benefit plans).   
  On June 2, 2016, the Company repaid   $50,000   of the principal balance of the Note. Following the receipt of a dividend from Union Security Insurance Company on June 23, 2016, the Company made a final payment of   $200,223  , which represented the remaining principal amount plus accrued interest and fees.      
  The interest expense and related fee amortization incurred related to the Note was   $1,731   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Credit Facility 
  The Company s commercial paper program requires the Company to maintain liquidity facilities either in an available amount equal to any outstanding notes from the commercial paper program or in an amount sufficient to maintain the ratings assigned to the notes issued from the commercial paper program. The Company s subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities. This program is currently backed up by a   $400,000   senior revolving credit facility, of which   $395,960   was available at September 30, 2016, due to   $4,040   of outstanding letters of credit related to this program. 
  On   September 16, 2014  , the Company entered into a   five  -year unsecured   $400,000   revolving credit agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of March 5, 2015, and Amendment No. 2, dated as of October 4, 2016 (the  2014 Credit Facility ), with a syndicate of banks arranged by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo, N.A. The 2014 Credit Facility replaced the Company's prior   four  -year   $350,000   revolving credit facility (the "2011 Credit Facility"), which was entered into on   September 21, 2011   and was scheduled to expire in   September 2015  . The 2011 Credit Facility terminated upon the effectiveness of the 2014 Credit Facility. The 2014 Credit Facility provides for revolving loans and the issuance of multi-bank, syndicated letters of credit and/or letters of credit from a sole issuing bank in an aggregate amount of   $400,000   and is available until   September 2019  , provided the Company is in compliance with all covenants. The 2014 Credit Facility has a sublimit for letters of credit issued thereunder of   $50,000  . The proceeds of these loans may be used for the Company s commercial paper program or for general corporate purposes. The Company may increase the total amount available under the 2014 Credit Facility to   $525,000   subject to certain conditions. No bank is obligated to provide commitments above their share of the   $400,000   facility.  
  The Company did not use the commercial paper program during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and there were   no   amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company made   no   borrowings using the 2014 Credit Facility and   no   loans are outstanding at September 30, 2016. 
  The 2014 Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants and requires that the Company maintain certain specified minimum ratios and thresholds. Among others, these covenants include maintaining a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and a minimum consolidated adjusted net worth. At September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all covenants, minimum ratios and thresholds.

11. Stock Based Compensation 
  Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan 
  Under the Assurant, Inc. Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan ( ALTEIP ), as amended and restated in May 2010, the Company is authorized to issue up to   5,300,000   new shares of the Company's common stock to employees, officers and non-employee directors. Under the ALTEIP, the Company may grant awards based on shares of its common stock, including stock options, stock appreciation rights ( SARs ), restricted stock (including performance shares), unrestricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs ), performance share units ( PSUs ) and dividend equivalents. All share-based grants are awarded under the ALTEIP. 
  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the  Compensation Committee ) awards PSUs and RSUs annually. RSUs and PSUs are promises to issue actual shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period or performance period. The RSUs granted to employees under the ALTEIP are based on salary grade and performance and generally vest one-third each year over a   three  -year period. RSUs granted to non-employee directors also vest one-third each year over a   three  -year period, however, issuance of vested shares is deferred until separation from Board service. RSUs receive dividend equivalents in cash during the restricted period and do not have voting rights during the restricted period. PSUs accrue dividend equivalents during the performance period based on a target payout, and will be paid in cash at the end of the performance period based on the actual number of shares issued.  
  Under the ALTEIP, the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) is authorized by the Board of Directors to grant common stock, restricted stock and RSUs to employees other than the executive officers of the Company (as defined in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). The Compensation Committee reviews these grants semi-annually. Restricted stock and RSUs granted under this program may have different vesting periods. 
  The fair value of RSUs is estimated using the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock at the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model.  The number of shares a participant will receive upon vesting of a PSU award is contingent upon the Company s performance with respect to selected metrics, as identified below. The payout levels for 2016 awards can vary between   0%   and   200%   (maximum) of the target (  100%  ) ALTEIP award amount and the payout levels for 2015 awards and prior can vary between   0%   and   150%   (maximum) of the target (  100%  ) ALTEIP award amount, based on the Company s level of performance against the selected metrics. 
  2016 PSU Performance Goals.   The Compensation Committee established total shareholder return and net operating earnings per diluted share, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, as the   two   equally weighted performance measures for PSU awards in 2016.  Total shareholder return is defined as appreciation in Company stock plus dividend yield to stockholders and will be measured by the performance of the Company relative to the S P 500 Index over the   three  -year performance period.  Net operating earnings per diluted share, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, is a Company-specific profitability metric and is defined as the Company s net operating earnings, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the period.  This metric is an absolute metric that is measured against a   three  -year cumulative target established by the Compensation Committee at the award date, and is not tied to the performance of peer companies. 
  2015 and prior PSU Performance Goals.   The Compensation Committee established book value per share ( BVPS ) growth excluding AOCI, revenue growth and total stockholder return as the   three   performance measures for PSU awards in 2015 and prior. BVPS growth is defined as the year-over-year growth of the Company s stockholders  equity excluding AOCI divided by the number of fully diluted total shares outstanding at the end of the period. Revenue growth is defined as the year-over-year change in total revenues as disclosed in the Company s annual statement of operations. Total stockholder return is defined as appreciation in Company stock plus dividend yield to stockholders. Payouts will be determined by measuring performance against the average performance of companies included in an insurance industry market index. 
  From 2009 to 2013, the Company used the A.M. Best U.S. Insurance Index to measure its relative performance ranking. In 2014, A.M. Best stopped publishing this index. As of January 1, 2014, the Company is using the S P Total Market Index to measure the Company s performance for all outstanding PSU awards in 2015 and prior. Consistent with adjustments made to the A.M. Best U.S. Insurance Index, adjustments will be made to the S P Total Market Index to exclude companies with revenues of less than   $1,000,000   or that are not in the insurance or managed healthcare Global Industry Classification Standard codes. In addition, companies within the Company s compensation peer group, but not otherwise in the S P Total Market

Index, will be included. The adjusted S P Total Market Index is substantially similar in composition to the previous A.M. Best U.S. Insurance Index. 
  Effective September 8, 2016, the Company amended its outstanding 2015 and 2014 PSU awards (except those awarded to executive officers of the Company, as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act) to exclude the Assurant Employee Benefits and Assurant Health segment revenue from the revenue growth metric in 2016. The modification was made as a result of the Company s exit of the health insurance market in 2016 and the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits on March 1, 2016 (for more information, see Notes 4 and 5). All other terms of the awards remained unchanged. The incremental expense recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to this modification was   $1,549  .  
  Restricted Stock Units 
  The following table shows a summary of RSU activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

As of September 30, 2016, there was   $21,590   of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.39   years.  
  Performance Share Units 
  The following table shows a summary of PSU activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Portions of the compensation expense recorded during 2014 were reversed in 2015 since the Company's level of actual performance as measured against pre-established performance goals had declined.  As of September 30, 2016, there was   $22,229   of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding PSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.03   years.    
  The fair value of PSUs with market conditions was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which utilizes multiple variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award. Expected volatilities for awards issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were based on the historical stock prices of the Company s stock and peer group. The expected term for grants issued during the nine months ended

September 30, 2016 and 2015 was assumed to equal the average of the vesting period of the PSUs. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
  Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ), the Company is authorized to issue up to   5,000,000   new shares to employees who are participants in the ESPP. Eligible employees can purchase shares at a   10%   discount applied to the lower of the closing price of the common stock on the first or last day of the offering period. 
  In January 2016, the Company issued   59,102   shares at a discounted price of   $61.70   for the offering period of July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. In January 2015, the Company issued   65,302   shares at a discounted price of   $59.65   for the offering period of July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. 
  In July 2016, the Company issued   45,649   shares at a discounted price of   $70.67   for the offering period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. In July 2015, the Company issued   65,320   shares at a discounted price of   $60.30   for the offering period of January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015.  
  The compensation expense recorded related to the ESPP was   $310   and   $322   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $950   and   $954   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  The fair value of each award under the ESPP was estimated at the beginning of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company s stock and the historical volatility of the Company s stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield is based on the current annualized dividend and share price as of the grant date. 
   
  12. Stock Repurchase 
  The following table shows the shares repurchased during the periods indicated:    

On September 9, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to   $750,000   of its outstanding common stock.  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased   8,431,361   shares of the Company s outstanding common stock at a cost of   $687,305  , exclusive of commissions, leaving   $264,798   remaining under the total repurchase authorization at September 30, 2016. 
  The timing and the amount of future repurchases will depend on market conditions, the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors.

13. Earnings Per Common Share 
  The following table presents net income, the weighted average common shares used in calculating basic earnings per common share ( EPS ) and those used in calculating diluted EPS for each period presented below.    

* 
    In accordance with earnings per share guidance, diluted per share amounts were computed in the same manner as basic per share amounts when a loss from operations existed during the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
     Average PSUs totaling   5,301   and   6,449   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, were outstanding but were anti-dilutive and thus not included in the computation of diluted EPS under the treasury stock method. There were   no   anti-dilutive PSUs outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

14. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits 
  The components of net periodic (gain) benefit cost for the Company s qualified pension benefits plan, nonqualified pension benefits plan and retirement health benefits plan for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:    

(1) 
    The Company s nonqualified plan is unfunded. 
     Effective January 1, 2014, the Assurant Pension Plan (the "Plan"), Assurant Executive Pension Plan and Assurant Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") were closed to new hires. Effective January 1, 2016, the Plan was amended and split into two separate plans, the Assurant Pension Plan No. 1 (Plan No. 1) and the Assurant Pension Plan No. 2 (Plan No. 2). Plan No. 2 generally includes a subset of the terminated vested population and the total population who commenced distribution of their accrued benefit prior to January 1, 2016. Plan No. 1 generally covers all other eligible employees (including the active population as of January 1, 2016, the remainder of the terminated vested population and all Puerto Rico participants).  Assets for both plans will remain in the Assurant, Inc. Pension Plan Trust. 
  Effective March 1, 2016, the Plan, the Assurant Executive Pension Plan, the SERP and the Retiree Medical Plan were amended such that no additional benefits will be earned after February 29, 2016. In connection with this amendment, the Company recorded a non-cash, curtailment gain of   $29,578   in the first quarter 2016, which is included in the gain on pension plan curtailment caption in the consolidated statements of operations.  
  Also as a result of the curtailment, the Plan's funded status increased to   $51,328   (based on the fair value of the assets compared to the accumulated benefit obligation) at September 30, 2016 from   $(51,973)   (based on the fair value of the assets compared to the projected benefit obligation) at December 31, 2015. This equates to a   106%   and   94%   funded status at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. During the first nine months of 2016,   no   cash was contributed to the Plan. Due to the Plan's current funded status,   no   additional cash is expected to be contributed to the Plan over the remainder of 2016.

  (In thousands, except number of shares and per share amounts) 

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced that it will make a special, one-time contribution of   three percent   of eligible pay into the defined contribution plan for all active employees as of December 31, 2016.  Employees whose employment ends between March 1 and December 30, 2016 due to death, total disability, retirement (as defined in the Plan) or as part of an involuntary termination without cause initiated by the Company are also eligible for this contribution. The Company had   $18,044   accrued in connection with this special, one-time contribution as of September 30, 2016.  
   
  15. Segment Information 
  During 2016, the Company announced its plans to realign its lines of business under a newly created Chief Operating Officer position. The senior management team continues to work on the new organizational framework and corresponding operating structure. The presentation of the segments described below is expected to be modified accordingly and prior periods' presentations revised to conform to the new operating segments. The Company expects such changes to be in effect by December 31, 2016. 
  As previously announced, the Company will substantially exit the health insurance market by the end of 2016 and sold its Assurant Employee Benefits segment on March 1, 2016, mainly through a series of reinsurance transactions. For more information see Notes 4 and 5, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has   five   reportable segments, which are defined based on the nature of the products and services offered:  
     Assurant Solutions: provides mobile device protection and related services; extended service contracts; vehicle protection; pre-funded funeral insurance and credit insurance. 
     Assurant Specialty Property: provides renters insurance; lender-placed homeowners insurance; mortgage valuation and field services and manufactured housing insurance. 
     Corporate   Other: includes activities of the holding company, financing and interest expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments and interest income earned from short-term investments held. Corporate   Other also includes the amortization of deferred gains and gains associated with the sales of Fortis Financial Group, Long-Term Care and Assurant Employee Benefits through reinsurance agreements and other unusual and infrequent items, including the loss related to the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits.  
     Assurant Health: includes amounts related to the previously announced exit from the health insurance market. 
     Assurant Employee Benefits: includes the results of operations for the periods prior to its sale on March 1, 2016. 
  The Company evaluates performance of the operating segments (Assurant Solutions; Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate   Other) based on segment income (loss) after-tax. The Company determines reportable segments in a manner consistent with the way the Chief Operating Decision Maker makes operating decisions and assesses performance.

16. Commitments and Contingencies 
  In the normal course of business, letters of credit are issued primarily to support reinsurance arrangements in which the Company is the reinsurer. These letters of credit are supported by commitments under which the Company is required to indemnify the financial institution issuing the letter of credit if the letter of credit is drawn. The Company had   $12,372   and   $19,809   of letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  On January 16, 2015, at the request of the Indiana Department of Insurance, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC") authorized a multistate targeted market conduct examination regarding the Company's lender placed insurance products. Various underwriting companies, including the American Security Insurance Company, are subject to the examination. At present,   44   jurisdictions are participating. During the course of the examination, which began in 2015, the Company has cooperated in responding to requests for information and documents and has engaged in various communications with the examiners. The examination continues and no final report has been issued.  
  In addition, the Company is involved in a variety of litigation relating to its current and past business operations and, from time to time, it may become involved in other such actions. In particular, the Company is a defendant in class actions in a number of jurisdictions regarding its lender-placed insurance programs. These cases assert a variety of claims under a number of legal theories. The plaintiffs seek premium refunds and other relief. The Company continues to defend itself vigorously in these class actions. We have participated and may participate in settlements on terms that we consider reasonable given the strength of our defenses and other factors.

  (In thousands, except number of shares and per share amounts) 

The Company has established an accrued liability for the legal and regulatory proceedings discussed above. However, the possible loss or range of loss resulting from such litigation and regulatory proceedings, if any, in excess of the amounts accrued is inherently unpredictable and uncertain. Consequently, no estimate can be made of any possible loss or range of loss in excess of the accrual. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of any pending legal or regulatory action, or the potential losses, fines, penalties or equitable relief, if any, that may result, it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows for an individual reporting period. However, based on currently available information, management does not believe that the pending matters are likely to have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Company s financial condition.  
  The Company is subject to certain indemnification requirements that were contractually agreed upon related to a previous disposition. The Company has an indemnification agreement pertaining to the actuarial development of claims reserves, for which it incurred an   $18,000   expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 based on adverse development realized in the three months ended September 30, 2016. The terms of the sale agreement stipulate that loss reserves be finalized and settled at the end of a   three   year period. The Company will be required to continually assess such liabilities through settlement, with any resulting adjustments recorded in earnings when a change in estimated payment is determined.  
  Guaranty Fund Assessments 
  Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner (the  Commissioner ) placed long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one of its subsidiaries (collectively,  Penn Treaty ) in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and subsequently petitioned a state court to convert the rehabilitation into a liquidation. In 2012, the state court denied the Commissioner s petition for liquidation. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in July 2015. The state court s 2012 order directed the Commissioner to develop a plan of rehabilitation. The Commissioner filed an initial rehabilitation plan in April 2013, and filed amended plans in August 2014 and October 2014. The state court began a hearing in July 2015, which is ongoing, to consider the Commissioner s most recent proposed rehabilitation plan, which contemplates a partial liquidation of Penn Treaty.  
  If Penn Treaty is placed in liquidation, the Company s insurance entities and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of Penn Treaty s policyholder claims through state guaranty association assessments. We are currently evaluating the estimate of losses resulting from this potential insolvency which will depend on when and to what extent Penn Treaty will be declared insolvent, the amount of the insolvency, the amount and timing of associated future guaranty association assessments or the amount or the availability of any premium tax or other potential offsets. We do not expect such amount to be material to the Company. It is reasonably possible that during 2016 we may record a liability and expense relating to Penn Treaty based on the progression to actual insolvency and our estimate of the resulting state assessments. 
   
  17. Income Taxes 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of   $18,000   in the Assurant Solutions segment. The tax benefit was driven by an international restructuring, in which there was a redemption of shares.  For U.S. tax purposes, the redemption was treated as a dividend of the shares, attracted foreign tax credits and resulted in a tax benefit. The benefit is reflected in the provision for income taxes line item in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of   $16,025   in the Assurant Corporate segment. The tax benefit was a result of the sale of certain non-insurance legal entities to National General and is reflected in the provision for income taxes line item in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 4 for more information.  In addition, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of   $8,448   in the Assurant Solutions segment. The tax benefit was primarily a result of an international reorganization and is reflected in the provision for income taxes line item in the consolidated statements of operations.

18. Catastrophe Bond Program 
  On June 26, 2013,  certain of the Company's subsidiaries ("the Subsidiaries") entered into   three   reinsurance agreements with Ibis Re II Ltd. ("Ibis Re II") providing up to   $185,000   of reinsurance coverage for protection against losses over a   three  -year period from individual hurricane events in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and along the Gulf and Eastern Coasts of the United States. Ibis Re II financed the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage by issuing   $185,000   in catastrophe bonds to unrelated investors (the  Series 2013-1 Notes ). The agreements expired in June 2016.

  General 
  During 2016, the Company announced its plans to realign its lines of business under a newly created Chief Operating Officer position.  The senior management team continues to work on the new organizational framework and corresponding operating structure.  The presentation of the segments described below is expected to be modified accordingly and prior periods' presentations revised to conform to the new operating segments.  The Company expects such changes to be in effect by December 31, 2016. 
  As previously announced, the Company will substantially exit the health insurance market by the end of 2016 and sold its Assurant Employee Benefits segment on March 1, 2016, mainly through a series of reinsurance transactions. For more information see Notes 4 and 5, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has   five   reportable segments, which are defined based on the nature of the products and services offered:  
     Assurant Solutions: provides mobile device protection and related services; extended service contracts; vehicle protection; pre-funded funeral insurance and credit insurance. 
     Assurant Specialty Property: provides renters insurance; lender-placed homeowners insurance; mortgage valuation and field services and manufactured housing insurance. 
     Corporate   Other: includes activities of the holding company, financing and interest expenses, net realized gains (losses) on investments and interest income earned from short-term investments held. Corporate   Other also includes the amortization of deferred gains and gains associated with the sales of Fortis Financial Group, Long-Term Care and Assurant Employee Benefits through reinsurance agreements and other unusual and infrequent items, including the loss related to the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits.  
     Assurant Health: includes amounts related to the previously announced exit from the health insurance market. 
     Assurant Employee Benefits: includes the results of operations for the periods prior to its sale on March 1, 2016. 
  
   50 

The Company evaluates performance of the operating segments (Assurant Solutions; Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate   Other) based on segment income (loss) after-tax. The Company determines reportable segments in a manner consistent with the way the Chief Operating Decision Maker makes operating decisions and assesses performance. 
   The following discussion relates to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 ( Third Quarter 2016  and "Nine Months 2016") and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 ( Third Quarter 2015  and "Nine Months 2015"). 
  Executive Summary 
  As previously announced, the Company concluded a comprehensive review of its portfolio and has sharpened its focus on specialty housing and lifestyle protection products and services. As a result, the Company will substantially exit the health insurance market by December 31, 2016 and, on March 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale, mainly through a series of reinsurance transactions, of its Assurant Employee Benefits segment to Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, a subsidiary of Sun Life Financial Inc. ( Sun Life ), for net cash consideration of   $926,174  .  For more information on the sale, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report. 
  Consolidated net income increased   $151,389   to net income of   $144,367   for Third Quarter 2016, compared with a net loss of   $(7,022)   for Third Quarter 2015. For Nine Months 2016, net income increased   $458,223   to   $534,034  , compared with net income of   $75,811   for Nine Months 2015. The increase in Third Quarter 2016 compared with Third Quarter 2015 was primarily due to lower losses and exit-related charges from the wind down of Assurant Health runoff operations and an increase in the amortization of deferred gains and gains on disposal of businesses related to the transfer of assets and other items associated with the sale of our Assurant Employee Benefits segment. These items were partially offset by higher reportable catastrophe losses related to floods in Louisiana as well as the ongoing normalization of our lender-placed homeowners insurance business. 
  Assurant Solutions net income decreased   $9,743   to   $42,702   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $52,445   for Third Quarter 2015. Excluding a $4,500 tax benefit in Third Quarter 2015, net income declined $5,243. The decline was primarily due to lower contributions from our mobile business, largely due to higher technology expenses to modernize certain systems and lower repair and logistics volumes as customers upgraded or traded-in significantly fewer phones this period. In addition, we experienced declines in legacy extended service contracts and domestic credit insurance businesses. These items were partially offset by higher real estate joint venture partnership income. 
  Third Quarter 2016 net earned premiums and fees increased $31,420 to $970,985 for Third Quarter 2016 compared with Third Quarter 2015 primarily due to an increase in mobile subscribers and growth in our vehicle service contracts business.  These items were partially offset by declines from certain North American retailers, our domestic credit business and foreign currency exchange volatility.  
  Overall, we expect Assurant Solution's full year net income to decline modestly from 2015. We expect growth from new and existing mobile programs in 2016 to be offset by declines in legacy extended service contracts, credit insurance and the loss of the tablet program. In order to improve performance and generate profitable growth we are implementing a more rigorous expense management process along with a more robust technology infrastructure to maximize our global capabilities. We expect net earned premiums and fees to increase in 2016, driven by growth in mobile subscribers and vehicle service contracts, partially offset by lower service contract revenue from legacy North American retail clients and continued declines in our credit insurance business. 
  Assurant Specialty Property net income decreased   $42,706   to   $44,551   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $87,257   for Third Quarter 2015 primarily due to higher weather-related claims and the ongoing normalization of our lender-placed homeowners insurance business. Third Quarter 2016 included $33,104 (after-tax) of reportable catastrophe losses from flooding in Louisiana, while Third Quarter 2015 had none. 
   Net earned premiums and fees decreased $18,650 to $579,070 for Third Quarter 2016 compared with Third Quarter 2015, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates in the lender-placed homeowners insurance business. The decrease was partially offset by growth in our multi-family housing and mortgage solutions businesses. The Multi-family housing revenue increase reflected a higher volume of renters  policies sold through our affinity channels and increased penetration rates across our property management network, while the mortgage solutions businesses revenue increase was primarily due to the July acquisition of American Title, Inc., a leader in title and valuation services for home equity lenders. 
   Overall, we expect Assurant Specialty Property s full year 2016 net income and net earned premiums to decrease from 2015 levels, reflecting the ongoing normalization of our lender-placed insurance business. We expect the decline to be partially offset by contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions businesses and increased efficiencies and expense savings initiatives. Overall results will be affected by catastrophe losses, including Hurricane Matthew, which inflicted severe  
  
   51 

flooding and wind damage, particularly in parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and the Caribbean in early October. We are still assessing the damage and processing claims, but we estimate losses could total up to $70,000 (after-tax). 
  Critical Factors Affecting Results and Liquidity 
  Our results depend on the appropriateness of our product pricing, underwriting and the accuracy of our methodology for the establishment of reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims, returns on and values of invested assets and our ability to manage our expenses. Factors affecting these items, including unemployment, difficult conditions in financial markets and the global economy, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. For more information on these factors, see  Item 1A Risk Factors  and  Item 7 MD A Critical Factors Affecting Results  in our 2015 Annual Report and  Item 1A-Risk Factors  in the First Quarter Report. 
  Management believes the Company will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs over the next twelve months including the ability to pay interest on our debt and dividends on our common stock. 
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities, including the effect of exchange rate changes and the reclassification of assets held for sale, totaled   $42,646  ; net cash provided by investing activities totaled   $631,265   and net cash used in financing activities totaled   $760,301  . We had   $1,116,623   in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016. Please see   Liquidity and Capital Resources,  below for further details. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our 2015 Annual Report describes the accounting policies and estimates that are critical to the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The accounting policies and estimation process described in the 2015 Annual Report were consistently applied to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for Third Quarter 2016.

Results of Operations 
    
  Assurant Consolidated 
  Overview 
  The table below presents information regarding our consolidated results of operations:    

The following discussion provides a general overall analysis of how the consolidated results were affected by our segments for Third Quarter 2016 and Nine Months 2016 compared to Third Quarter 2015 and Nine Months 2015, respectively. Please see the discussion that follows for each of these segments for a more detailed analysis of the fluctuations. 
  For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Income (Loss) 
  Results increased   $151,389  , or   2,156%  , to net income of   $144,367   for Third Quarter 2016, compared with a net loss of   $(7,022)   for Third Quarter 2015. The increase was primarily due to lower losses and exit-related charges from the wind down of Assurant Health runoff operations and an increase in the amortization of deferred gains and gains on disposal of businesses related to the transfer of assets and other items associated with the sale of our Assurant Employee Benefits segment, mainly through a series of reinsurance transactions, to Sun Life. For more information on the sale, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report. These items were partially offset by higher reportable catastrophe losses related to floods in Louisiana as well as the ongoing normalization of our lender-placed homeowners insurance business.  
  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Income 
  Net income increased   $458,223  , or   604%  , to   $534,034   for Nine Months 2016, compared with   $75,811   of net income for Nine Months 2015. The increase was primarily due to lower losses and exit-related charges from the wind down of the Assurant Health runoff operations and an additional $111,730 (after-tax) in net realized gains on investments and a $194,682 (after-tax) increase in amortization of deferred gains and gains on disposal of businesses, both related to the transfer of assets and other items associated with the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits segment. For more information on the sale, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report.  
  
   53 

In addition, Nine Months 2016 includes a $19,226 (after-tax) one-time curtailment gain associated with our previously disclosed pension plan freeze, effective March 1, 2016. For more information on the pension plan freeze, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report.

Assurant Solutions 
  Overview 
  The table below presents information regarding Assurant Solutions  segment results of operations:    

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Income 
  Segment net income decreased   $9,743  , or   19%  , to   $42,702   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $52,445   for Third Quarter 2015. The decrease was due in part to a $4,500 net tax benefit in Third Quarter 2015 from international operations that did not recur in the Third Quarter 2016. Additionally, segment net income declined primarily due to lower contributions from mobile, legacy extended service contracts from North American retailers and our credit insurance business. Mobile results reflected lower than expected volumes from mobile repair and logistics and higher expenses related to certain technology systems. These items were partially offset by $3,269 (after-tax) investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships.  
  Total Revenues 
  Total revenues increased   $35,558  , or   3%  , to   $1,066,334   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $1,030,776   for Third Quarter 2015. Net earned premiums increased $7,707 primarily due to growth from our domestic vehicle protection business and our global mobile protection programs. Fees and other income increased $23,713, primarily driven by growth in mobile subscribers.  These items were partially offset by foreign currency exchange volatility as well as declines from legacy retail clients and credit insurance. Net investment income increased $4,138 in Third Quarter 2016 compared with Third Quarter 2015, primarily due to increases in investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. A few significant clients continued to account for a substantial portion of segment revenues. 
  Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses 
  Total benefits, losses and expenses increased   $46,706  , or   5%  , to   $1,003,550   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $956,844   for Third Quarter 2015. Policyholder benefits increased $5,664, primarily due to overall growth in our domestic vehicle protection business and global mobile protection programs. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased $41,042, mostly related to growth in our domestic mobile programs, including higher expenses related to certain technology systems, and domestic vehicle protection business, partially offset by foreign currency exchange volatility. 

55 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Income 
  Segment net income decreased   $16,383  , or   10%  , to   $151,236   for Nine Months 2016 from   $167,619   for Nine Months 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the loss of a domestic tablet program and an adjustment related to the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and policyholders benefits for an older block of preneed policies. These items were partially offset by a $5,100 net tax benefit increase related to a redemption of shares in our international structure. 
  Total Revenues 
  Total revenues increased   $97,142  , or   3%  , to   $3,178,812   for Nine Months 2016 from   $3,081,670   for Nine Months 2015. Net earned premiums decreased $5,198 primarily due to foreign currency exchange volatility, the loss of a domestic tablet program and the continued run-off of our credit insurance business. These items were partially offset by growth from our domestic vehicle protection business and global mobile protection programs. Fees and other income increased $113,084, primarily driven by growth in our global mobile programs and subscribers. A few significant clients continued to account for a substantial portion of segment revenues. 
  Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses 
  Total benefits, losses and expenses increased   $135,171  , or   5%  , to   $2,981,718   for Nine Months 2016 from   $2,846,547   for Nine Months 2015. Policyholder benefits increased $3,998 primarily due to higher loss experience in our global mobile protection programs due in part to expansion of our international mobile business in Asia and Europe, an adjustment related to the amortization of policyholder benefits for an older block of preneed policies.     Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased $131,173, mostly related to our domestic mobile protection programs and related services, growth in our domestic vehicle protection business and an adjustment related to the amortization of a deferred acquisition cost adjustment mentioned earlier. These items were partially offset by foreign currency exchange volatility and lower legal expenses.

Assurant Specialty Property 
  Overview 
  The table below presents information regarding Assurant Specialty Property s segment results of operations: 

Regulatory Matters       
  In January 2015, New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") issued regulations regarding tracking costs associated with lender placed insurance rates. The Company reached an agreement with the NYDFS to file for a 6.2% reduction in lender-placed hazard insurance rates in New York. The rates have been filed and approved, and were effective for new and renewing policies starting February 1, 2016.  
  Lender-placed insurance products accounted for 58% and 65% of net earned premiums and fees for Nine Months 2016 and Nine Months 2015, respectively.  The approximate corresponding contributions to the segment net income in these periods were 63% and 77%. The portion of total segment net income attributable to lender-placed products may vary substantially over time depending on the frequency, severity and location of catastrophic losses, the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and reinstatement coverage, the variability of claim processing costs and client acquisition costs, and other factors. In addition, we expect placement rates for these products to decline. 

57 

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Income 
  Segment net income decreased   $42,706  , or   49%  , to   $44,551   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $87,257   for Third Quarter 2015 primarily due to higher weather-related claims and the ongoing normalization of our lender-placed homeowners insurance business. Third Quarter 2016 included $33,104 (after-tax) of reportable catastrophe losses, while Third Quarter 2015 had none.  
    
  Total Revenues 
  Total revenues decreased   $21,322  , or   3%  , to   $596,061   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $617,383   for Third Quarter 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower lender-placed homeowners insurance net earned premiums, partially offset by fee income growth from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions businesses, including the recently acquired title and valuation business. The decline in lender-placed homeowners insurance is primarily due to expected decline in placement rates, previously disclosed loss of client business and premium rate reductions. A few significant clients continued to account for a substantial portion of segment revenue.  
  Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses 
  Total benefits, losses and expenses increased   $47,240  , or   10%  , to   $531,475   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $484,235   for Third Quarter 2015. Total policyholder benefits increased $46,219 to $218,663 for Third Quarter 2016, compared with $172,444 for Third Quarter 2015.  The increase was primarily related to $50,929 of reportable catastrophe losses in Third Quarter 2016 while Third Quarter 2015 had no reportable catastrophe losses. Reportable catastrophe losses include only individual catastrophic events that generated losses to the Company in excess of $5,000, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. Selling, underwriting and general expenses increased $1,021 in Third Quarter 2016 compared with Third Quarter 2015 mainly due to growth in mortgage solutions businesses. 
  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Income 
  Segment net income decreased   $72,035  , or   29%  , to   $177,843   for Nine Months 2016 from   $249,878   for Nine Months 2015 primarily due to higher weather-related claims and the ongoing normalization of lender-placed homeowners insurance business. Nine Months 2016 included $58,469 (after-tax) of reportable catastrophe losses, while Nine Months 2015 had $9,497 (after-tax).  
    
  Total Revenues 
  Total revenues decreased   $143,410  , or   7%  , to   $1,770,763   for Nine Months 2016 from   $1,914,173   for Nine Months 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower lender-placed homeowners insurance net earned premiums. The decline in lender-placed homeowners net earned premiums was primarily due to expected decline in placement rates, lower premium rates, and previously disclosed loss of client business. These items were partially offset by an increase in revenues from the multi-family housing and mortgage solutions businesses. A few significant clients continued to account for a substantial portion of segment revenues. 
  Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses 
  Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased   $31,688  , or   2%  , to   $1,506,042   for Nine Months 2016 from   $1,537,730   for Nine Months 2015. Total policyholder benefits increased $9,142 to $600,794 for Nine Months 2016 compared with $591,652 for Nine Months 2015.  The increase was primarily due to $89,952 of reportable catastrophe losses in Nine Months 2016 compared with $14,612 for Nine Months 2015, which was largely offset by favorable non-catastrophe losses due to lower claims frequency and severity. Reportable catastrophe losses include only individual catastrophic events that generated losses to the Company in excess of $5,000, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased $40,830 in Nine Months 2016 compared with Nine Months 2015 mainly due to savings from cost efficiency efforts, partially offset by growth in mortgage solutions businesses.

Assurant Health 
  Overview 
  The table below presents information regarding Assurant Health s segment results of operations: 

(2) 
    Third Quarter 2016 and Nine Months 2016 includes the impact of the total current period net utilization of the premium deficiency reserve of $21,562 and $20,187, respectively, for claim costs and claim adjustment expenses included in policyholder benefits, as well as maintenance costs, which are included within underwriting, general and administrative expenses (the net year to date utilization includes a partially offsetting additional premium deficiency charge incurred in first six months of 2016). In addition, such amounts include benefits from pharmacy rebates and favorable claims development. 
       
  As previously announced, the Company concluded a comprehensive review of its portfolio and sharpened its focus on specialty housing and lifestyle protection products and services. As a result, the Company will substantially exit the health insurance market by the end of 2016. For more information, see Note 4 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.  
  The Affordable Care Act 
  Some provisions of the Affordable Care Act continue to affect our health insurance business, even though it is in run-off.  For more information, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors Risk related to our industry Reform of the health insurance industry could materially reduce the profitability of certain of our businesses or render them unprofitable" in our 2015 Annual Report and "Item 1A-Risk Factors" in the First Quarter Report. 
  Because all individuals now have a guaranteed right to purchase health insurance policies, the Affordable Care Act introduced new and significant premium stabilization programs in 2014: reinsurance, risk adjustment, and risk corridor (together, the  3 Rs ). These programs, discussed in further detail below, are meant to mitigate the potential adverse impact to individual health insurers as a result of Affordable Care Act provisions that became effective January 1, 2014. 
    
  Reinsurance 
  This is a transitional program for 2014-2016, with decreasing benefit over the three years. All commercial individual and group medical health plans are required to contribute to the funding of the program. Only for individual health plans that are in compliance with the essential health benefits of the Affordable Care Act are insurers eligible to receive benefits from the program. 
  
   59 

We are required to make contributions, which are recorded quarterly, based on both our Affordable Care Act and non-Affordable Care Act business. Contributions based on our non-Affordable Care Act business are included in selling, underwriting and general expenses and contributions based on our Affordable Care Act business are included as ceded premiums. Recoveries are recorded quarterly as ceded policyholder benefits. 
    
  For the Nine Months 2016, due to a change in estimate and following receipt of the final payment notifications for the 2015 risk mitigation programs from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), we reduced our estimate of expected reinsurance recoveries by $7,832, through a charge to policyholder benefits in our consolidated statements of operations. There were no additional charges recorded in Third Quarter 2016. We did not record any reinsurance contributions for the Third Quarter 2016 and Nine Months 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we have reinsurance recoverables of $31,597 on our consolidated balance sheets. During Third Quarter 2016 and Nine Months 2016, we collected $190,692 and $256,992, respectively, under the 2015 program. 
  Risk Adjustment 
  This is a permanent program to transfer funds between health insurers based on the average health risk scores of their Affordable Care Act insured populations. Insurers with below-average risk scores contribute into the pool. Insurers with above-average risk scores receive payments out of the pool.  
  Risk scores are evaluated at the state, market, and legal entity level for policies that comply with the Affordable Care Act. Risk adjustment amounts payable and receivable are reflected as adjustments to net earned premiums, and are recorded quarterly based on our current estimated loss experience of our Affordable Care Act business.  
  For Third Quarter 2016 and Nine Months 2016, following receipt of the final payment notifications for the 2015 risk mitigation programs from CMS, we recorded net risk adjustment premiums of $(8,938) and $(30,745), respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations, reflecting changes in the allowance for adverse development in our relative risk score. As of September 30, 2016, we carried net risk adjustment receivables of $66,381, net of an allowance for adverse development of $26,061, on our consolidated balance sheets. During Third Quarter 2016 and Nine Months 2016, we collected $120,922 (net) under the 2015 program. During Nine Months 2016, we collected $7,148 under the 2014 program.  
  Risk Corridor 
  This is a temporary risk-sharing program for 2014-2016. Based on ratios of allowable costs to target costs as defined by the Affordable Care Act, health insurers will make payments to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) or receive funds from HHS. Because Assurant Health did not participate in any public insurance marketplaces for 2014, risk corridors had no impact on our 2014 operations. Assurant Health began participating in the public insurance marketplaces for 2015. As of September 30, 2016, receivables under the risk corridor program are $104,847, however, we have not recorded a net receivable because payments from HHS under this program are uncertain.  
  Estimates of amounts receivable from these programs are subject to considerable uncertainty and actual amounts received may vary substantially from our estimates. 
    
  For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Loss  
  Segment net loss was   $1,746   for Third Quarter 2016 compared to a net loss of   $144,397   for Third Quarter 2015.     The difference was primarily attributable to the premium deficiency reserve and exit related costs in Third Quarter 2015 due to the aforementioned decision to put the segment into runoff. 
  Total Revenues 
  Total revenues decreased to   $6,980   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $572,181   for Third Quarter 2015. Net earned premiums from our individual medical and our small employer group businesses decreased due to the decline in membership and sales as we exit the health insurance market.  
  Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses 
  Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased to   $7,014   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $792,359   for Third Quarter 2015. The decrease in policyholder benefits was attributable to the decrease of inforce policies as a result of the exit from the health insurance market including all of the individual Affordable Care Act medical policies which were terminated at the end of 2015. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased primarily due to lower commission expense resulting from the  
  
   60 

discontinuance of sales and decreased general expenses as we run-off the business. This decrease was partially offset by $3,340 of severance costs. 
    
  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net Loss  
  Segment net loss was   $34,345   for Nine Months 2016 compared to a net loss of   $352,141   for Nine Months 2015. The change was primarily due to the items noted above. 
  Total Revenues 
  Total revenues decreased to   $50,691   for Nine Months 2016 from   $1,813,410   for Nine Months 2015. Net earned premiums from our individual medical business decreased   $1,457,362  , while net earned premiums from our small employer group business decreased   $263,150  . The decrease for both products is due to the decline in membership and sales as we exit the health insurance market.  
  Total Benefits, Losses and Expenses 
  Total benefits, losses and expenses decreased to   $92,769   for Nine Months 2016 from   $2,317,421   for Nine Months 2015. Policyholder benefits decreased $1,923,465 attributable to the decrease of inforce policies as a result of the exit from the health insurance market, including all of the individual Affordable Care Act medical policies which were terminated at the end of 2015. Selling, underwriting and general expenses decreased $301,187 due to decreased commission expense resulting from the discontinuance of sales and decreased general expenses as we run-off the business. This decrease was partially offset by $24,284 of severance costs.

Assurant Employee Benefits 
  Overview 
  The table below presents information regarding Assurant Employee Benefits  segment results of operations:

For more information on the sale see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report. In addition, Nine Months 2016 includes a $19,226 (after-tax) one-time curtailment gain associated with our previously disclosed pension plan freeze, effective March 1, 2016.

  The Company had total investments of   $12,033,090   and   $12,994,772   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Net unrealized gains on the Company's fixed maturity portfolio increased   $339,136   during Nine Months 2016, from   $744,533   at December 31, 2015 to   $1,083,669   at September 30, 2016.  This increase was mainly due to a decrease in treasury yields and credit spreads. For more information on the Company's investments see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
  The following table shows the credit quality of the Company's fixed maturity securities portfolio as of the dates indicated: 

Major categories of net investment income were as follows:    

Net investment income decreased   $23,968  , or   16%  , to   $124,798   for Third Quarter 2016 from   $148,766   for Third Quarter 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment yields and lower invested assets, partially offset by a   $2,672   increase in investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships. Net investment income decreased   $88,500  , or   19%  , to   $380,325   for Nine Months 2016 from   $468,825   for Nine Months 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a   $11,297   decrease in investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships, lower investment yields and lower invested assets.  
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company owned   $121,095   of securities guaranteed by financial guarantee insurance companies. Included in this amount was   $110,205   of municipal securities, whose credit rating was A+ with the guarantee, but would have had a rating of A without the guarantee. 
  The Company has exposure to sub-prime and related mortgages within the Company's fixed maturity security portfolio. At September 30, 2016, approximately   2%   of the residential mortgage-backed holdings had exposure to sub-prime mortgage collateral. This represented less than   1%   of the total fixed income portfolio and approximately   1%   of the total unrealized gain position. Of the securities with sub-prime exposure, approximately   6%   are rated as investment grade. All residential mortgage-backed securities, including those with sub-prime exposure, are reviewed as part of the ongoing other-than-temporary impairment monitoring process.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Regulatory Requirements 
  Assurant, Inc. is a holding company and, as such, has limited direct operations of its own. Our holding company s assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our holding company s future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends and to make such other payments will be limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject our subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions. The dividend requirements and regulations vary from state to state and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary. These laws and regulations require, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends they can pay to the holding company. For further information on pending amendments to state insurance holding company laws, including the NAIC s  Solvency Modernization Initiative,  see  Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Industry Changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth  in our 2015 Annual Report and  Item 1A-Risk Factors  in the First Quarter Report. Along with solvency regulations, the primary driver in determining the capital used for subsidiary dividends is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from A.M. Best. 
  Regulators or rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries. This in turn, could negatively affect our capital resources. As previously announced, the Company will exit the health insurance market and has sold its Assurant Employee Benefits segment on March 1, 2016, mainly through a series of reinsurance transactions with Sun Life. Following the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits, the following actions were taken by the rating agencies: 
  A.M. Best  
             
    Removed ratings of Union Security Insurance Company and Union Security Life Insurance Company of New York from under review with negative implications and affirmed with a stable outlook.   
                
    Ratings of Assurant's senior debt were upgraded from bbb to bbb+.  
                
    Ratings of Assurant's commercial paper were upgraded from AMB-2 to AMB-1. 
                
    Ratings of all other rated entities were affirmed with a stable outlook.  
     Moody's Investor Services ("Moody's")  
             
    Rating of Union Security Insurance Company was affirmed and the outlook revised from developing to stable.  
                
    Withdrew the ratings of John Alden Life Insurance Company and Time Insurance Company.    
                
    All other ratings remain unchanged.  
     Standard and Poor s ( S P )    
             
    Rating of Union Security Insurance Company was upgraded from A- to A.  
                
    Withdrew the ratings of John Alden Life Insurance Company and Time Insurance Company.  
                
    All other ratings remain unchanged.  
       
  For further information on our ratings and the risks of ratings downgrades, see  Item 1 Business  and  Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company A.M. Best, Moody s and S P rate the financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease  in our 2015 Annual Report and "Item 1A- Risk Factors" in the First Quarter Report.  
  For 2016, the maximum dividends our U.S. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay without prior regulatory approval is approximately   $564,000  . 
    
  Liquidity 
  As of September 30, 2016, we had   $873,992   in holding company capital. We use the term  holding company capital  to represent the portion of cash and other liquid marketable securities held at Assurant, Inc., out of a total of   $1,004,089  , which we are not otherwise holding for a specific purpose as of the balance sheet date. We can use such capital for stock repurchases, stockholder dividends, acquisitions, and other corporate purposes.   $250,000   of the   $873,992   of holding company capital is intended to serve as a buffer against remote risks (such as large-scale hurricanes). Dividends or returns of capital, net of infusions, made to the holding company by its operating companies were   $1,312,938   for Nine Months 2016, which includes approximately   $754,000   of dividends from statutory insurance subsidiaries that received the cash proceeds related to the sale of the Assurant Employee Benefits segment. The sale of Assurant Employee Benefits is expected to ultimately provide  
  
   66 

approximately   $1,000,000   to the holding company including net proceeds and capital releases. In 2015, dividends, net of infusions, made to the holding company from its operating companies were   $174,579  , and used primarily to pay expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our stockholders, to fund acquisitions and to repurchase our shares. 
  In addition to paying expenses and making interest payments on indebtedness, our capital management strategy provides for several uses for the cash generated by our subsidiaries, including without limitation, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, investing in our businesses to support growth in targeted areas, and making prudent and opportunistic acquisitions. From time to time, the Company may also seek to purchase outstanding debt in open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions. We made share repurchases and paid dividends to our stockholders of   $782,508   and   $378,819   during Nine Months 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. We expect operating segment dividends, from Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property, to approximate segment net income, subject to the growth of the business, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements. We also expect approximately   $475,000   in dividends from Assurant Health insurance subsidiaries for full year 2016, of which approximately   $189,000   was received in Third Quarter 2016 and totaled approximately   $338,000   for Nine Months 2016, subject to ultimate development of claims, actual expenses needed to wind down operations, recoveries from Affordable Care Act risk mitigation payments and regulatory approval. 
  The primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and net investment income. We use cash primarily to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. We generally invest our subsidiaries  excess funds to generate investment income. 
  We conduct periodic asset liability studies to measure the duration of our insurance liabilities, to develop optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for our significant lines of business and ultimately to assess whether cash flows are sufficient to meet cash needs. These studies are conducted in accordance with formal company-wide Asset Liability Management ( ALM ) guidelines. 
  To complete a study for a particular line of business, we develop models to project asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet items under a large, varied set of plausible economic scenarios. These models consider many factors including the current investment portfolio, the required capital for the related assets and liabilities, our tax position and projected cash flows from both existing and projected new business. 
  Alternative asset portfolio structures are analyzed for significant lines of business. An investment portfolio maturity structure is then selected from these profiles given our return hurdle and risk preference. Sensitivity testing of significant liability assumptions and new business projections is also performed. 
  Our liabilities generally have limited policyholder optionality, which means that the timing of payments is relatively insensitive to the interest rate environment. In addition, our investment portfolio is largely comprised of highly liquid fixed maturity securities with a sufficient component of such securities invested that are near maturity which may be sold with minimal risk of loss to meet cash needs. Therefore, we believe we have limited exposure to disintermediation risk. 
  Generally, our subsidiaries  premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, provide sufficient cash to pay claims and expenses. However, there may be instances when unexpected cash needs arise in excess of that available from usual operating sources. In such instances, we have several options to raise needed funds, including selling assets from the subsidiaries  investment portfolios, using holding company cash (if available), issuing commercial paper, or drawing funds from our revolving credit facility. In addition, we have filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. This registration statement allows us to issue equity, debt or other types of securities through one or more methods of distribution. The terms of any offering would be established at the time of the offering, subject to market conditions. If we decide to make an offering of securities, we will consider the nature of the cash requirement as well as the cost of capital in determining what type of securities we may offer. 
  We paid dividends of   $0.50   per common share on September 13, 2016 to stockholders of record as of August 29, 2016. Any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon: our subsidiaries  payment of dividends and/or other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial position and capital requirements; general business conditions; legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. 
  On September 9, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional   $750,000   of its outstanding common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased   8,431,361   shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of   $687,305  , exclusive of commissions. As of September 30, 2016,   $264,798   remained  
  
   67 

under the total repurchase authorization. The timing and the amount of future repurchases will depend on market conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors.  
    
  Management believes the Company will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs over the next 12 months, including the ability to pay interest on our debt and dividends on our common shares. 
  Retirement and Other Employee Benefits 
  For information on our retirement and other employee benefits see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report. 
  Debt  
  For information on our Senior Notes, Commercial Paper Program and Revolving Credit Facility see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report. 
  Cash Flows    
  We monitor cash flows at the consolidated, holding company and subsidiary levels. Cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs, making adjustments to the forecasts when needed. 
  The table below shows our recent net cash flows: 

____________________ 
           (1) 
    Includes effect of exchange rate changes and the reclassification of assets held for sale on cash and cash equivalents. 
     We typically generate operating cash inflows from premiums collected from our insurance products and income received from our investments while outflows consist of policy acquisition costs, benefits paid, and operating expenses. These net cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance products and required capital supporting these products. Our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees, and investment income received and expenses paid. 
  Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was   $(42,646)   and   $480,238   for Nine Months 2016 and Nine Months 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used by operating activities was primarily due to Assurant Health paying claims without a corresponding collection of premiums since this business is now in runoff and the timing of other payments in the normal course of business. These items were partially offset by changes in the receivable related to the 3 Rs programs due to Assurant Health being in runoff. 
  Net cash provided by investing activities was   $631,265   and   $70,374   for Nine Months 2016 and Nine Months 2015, respectively. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the sale of the Assurant Employee Benefits segment, mainly through reinsurance transactions, to Sun Life, changes in our short term investments and an increase in sales of commercial mortgage loans.  See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the sale of commercial mortgage loans.  These increases were partially offset by the purchase of fixed maturity securities.   
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $760,301   and   $325,332   for Nine Months 2016 and Nine Months 2015, respectively. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in the repurchase of our outstanding common stock.

The table below shows our cash outflows for interest and dividends for the periods indicated: 

Letters of Credit 
  In the normal course of business, we issue letters for various purposes, including to support reinsurance agreements. These letters of credit are supported by commitments with financial institutions. We had   $12,372   and   $19,809   of letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

  AMENDMENT NO. 2 
    
  AMENDMENT NO. 2 dated as of October 4, 2016 between Assurant, Inc., the Lenders executing this Amendment No. 2 on the signature pages hereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement referred to below. 
    
  Assurant, Inc., the lenders party thereto (including the Lenders executing this Amendment No. 2 on the signature pages hereto) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, are parties to a Credit Agreement dated as of September 16, 2014, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of March 5, 2015 (as so amended, the    Credit Agreement   ), providing, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, for extensions of credit to be made by said lenders to the Borrower in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $400,000,000 (subject to any increases effected pursuant to   Section 2.9   of the Credit Agreement). 
    
  The Borrower and the Lenders party hereto wish now to amend the Credit Agreement in certain respects, and accordingly, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 
    
  Section 1.    Definitions  .  Except as otherwise defined in this Amendment No. 2, terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as defined therein. 
    
  Section 2.    Amendments  .  Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent specified in Section 3 below, and effective as of the date of satisfaction of such conditions, the Credit Agreement shall be amended as follows: 
    
  2.1.  References in the Credit Agreement (including references to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby) to  this Agreement  (and indirect references such as  hereunder ,  hereby ,  herein  and  hereof ) shall be deemed to be references to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby. 
    
  2.2.        Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following new defined term in the appropriate alphabetical order: 
    
     Managed Vehicle    means any bankruptcy-remote collateralized debt obligation fund or other bankruptcy-remote sponsored investment vehicle managed by the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower. 
    
  2.3.        Section 1.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the defined terms  Material Indebtedness ,  Non-Recourse Indebtedness  and  Subsidiary  and replacing such defined terms with the following: 
    
     Material Indebtedness    means Indebtedness (other than the Loans, Letters of Credit and Non-Recourse Indebtedness), or obligations in respect of one or more Swap Agreements, of any one or more of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in an aggregate principal amount exceeding $100,000,000.  For purposes of determining Material Indebtedness, the  principal amount  of the obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any Swap Agreement at any time shall be the maximum aggregate amount (giving effect to any netting agreements) that the Borrower or such Subsidiary would be required to pay if such Swap Agreement were terminated at such time. 
    
     Non-Recourse Indebtedness    means, with respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, Indebtedness of any Person (including of any Managed Vehicle) for which the  

owner of such Indebtedness has no recourse, directly or indirectly, to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or to any property (except as provided below) of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries for the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Indebtedness, and for which the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not directly or indirectly liable for the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Indebtedness.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indebtedness of a Person shall be  Non-Recourse Indebtedness  if the owner of such Indebtedness has recourse that is limited solely to (i) real property securing such Indebtedness pursuant to mortgages, deeds of trust or other security interests to which such Indebtedness relates and (ii) recourse obligations or liabilities solely for fraud, environmental matters and other customary  non-recourse carve-outs  in respect of any such Indebtedness. 
    
     Subsidiary        means, with respect to any Person, any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, joint venture or other business entity of which more than 50% of the total voting power of shares of stock or other ownership interests entitled (without regard to the occurrence of any contingency) to vote in the election of the Person or Persons (whether directors, managers, trustees or other Persons performing similar functions) having the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies thereof is at the time owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by that Person or one or more of the other Subsidiaries of that Person or a combination thereof;   provided   that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no real estate Joint Venture of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries shall be considered a Subsidiary unless such Joint Venture is consolidated on the balance sheet of the Borrower and (ii) any Managed Vehicle shall be deemed not to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower.  Unless otherwise expressly provided, all references herein to a  Subsidiary  shall mean a Subsidiary of the Borrower.

   For the avoidance of doubt, all financial covenants and computations of amounts and ratios contained herein shall be calculated without giving effect to, and shall exclude, any financial impact of any Managed Vehicle that is consolidated by the Borrower in accordance with GAAP other than (i) the fair value of investments in the Managed Vehicles by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) earnings resulting from the change in the fair value of such investments, (iii) investment income earned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries from its investment in the Managed Vehicles, and (iv) management fees earned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries from the Managed Vehicles.  
    
  2.5.    Section 4.9   of the Credit Agreement shall be amended by deleting such Section in its entirety and substituting in lieu thereof the following: 
    
     4.9        Government Regulation  . 
    
  The Borrower is not required to register as an  investment company  under and as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.  The Borrower is not a  registered investment company  or a company  controlled  by a  registered investment company  or a  principal underwriter  of a  registered investment company  as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.  
    
  Section 3.    Conditions Precedent  .
