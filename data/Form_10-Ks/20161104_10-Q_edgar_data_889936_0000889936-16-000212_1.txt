NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

PrivateBancorp, Inc. ( PrivateBancorp  or the  Company ), a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1989, is a Chicago-based bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is the holding company for The PrivateBank and Trust Company ( PrivateBank  or the  Bank ), an Illinois-chartered bank founded in Chicago in 1991. Through the Bank, we provide customized business and personal financial services to middle market companies, as well as business owners, executives, entrepreneurs and families in the markets and communities we serve. 
    
  On   June 29, 2016  , the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC ), a Canadian chartered bank, and CIBC Holdco Inc. ( Holdco ), a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC, pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving the merger. Following the merger, the Bank will be headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, retain its Illinois state banking charter and be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter 2017, pending regulatory and stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions. 
    
  Under the terms of the definitive agreement, shareholders of the Company will receive   $18.80   in cash and   0.3657   of a CIBC common share for each share of PrivateBancorp common stock. As of   June 28, 2016  , the last trading day before public announcement of the transaction, total consideration for the transaction was valued at approximately   $3.8 billion  , or   $47.00   per share of common stock of the Company, based on CIBC s closing stock price on   June 28, 2016   of   $77.11  . As of such date, the aggregate consideration would have been paid with approximately   $1.5 billion   in cash and approximately   29.5 million   common shares of CIBC, representing a 40 percent cash and 60 percent share mix. The actual transaction value will be based on the number of shares of common stock of the Company outstanding at the closing and the price of CIBC common stock as of the closing.  
    
  Additional information about the definitive agreement is set forth in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on July 6, 2016. 
    
  Direct costs related to the proposed transaction were expensed as incurred and totaled   $6.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . These costs were primarily comprised of financial advisor and other professional services fees. 
    
  1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of PrivateBancorp have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include certain information and footnote disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete annual financial statements. Accordingly, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and (where applicable) in accordance with accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulation and authority, and reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other period. 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of the Company and the Bank, after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
    
  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we have considered the impact of events occurring subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , for potential recognition or disclosure. 

2.   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period     -   On January 1, 2016, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by   the Financial Accounting  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

Standards Board ( FASB ) that clarifies the accounting for a performance target that affects vesting of a share-based payment award and that could be achieved after the requisite service period. The guidance indicates that such a performance target would not be reflected in the estimation of the award s grant date fair value. Rather, compensation cost for such an award would be recognized over the requisite service period, if it is probable that the performance target will be achieved. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period would reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and would be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The guidance is applied prospectively to awards that are granted or modified after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.  
    
  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   -     On January 1, 2016, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB that changes certain aspects of the variable interest and voting interest consolidation models. The amendments modify existing guidance on (1) the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, (2) when fee arrangements represent variable interests in a VIE, and (3) the primary beneficiary determination for VIEs. Additionally, the guidance eliminates the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership under the voting interest model and exempts reporting entities from consolidating money market funds that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company elected to apply the guidance through a cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. 
    
  Debt Issuance Costs   - On January 1, 2016, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB that clarifies the presentation of debt issuance costs within the balance sheet. This guidance requires that an entity present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, not as a separate asset. The standard does not affect the current guidance for the recognition and measurement for debt issuance costs. This guidance was applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not materially impact our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. 
    
  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   - In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends certain aspects of share-based payment accounting. The new guidance (1) requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, and eliminates the accounting for additional paid-in-capital pools; (2) allows the Company to repurchase more of an employee's shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting; (3) requires the Company to make an accounting policy election to either recognize forfeitures as they occur or estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited; (4) requires the Company to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows; and (5) clarifies that the Company must classify cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows. Regarding the accounting policy election related to the accounting for forfeitures, the Company has elected to estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited, consistent with our past practice of estimating forfeitures. As permitted under the new guidance, the Company has elected to early adopt the guidance for the Company s financial statements that include periods beginning on January 1, 2016. The Company has applied the guidance related to items (1) and (4) prospectively; the guidance related to item (5) retrospectively; and the guidance related to items (2) and (3) using a modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a   $2.8 million   tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income within the income tax provision, representing the prospective application of the accounting change described in (1) above. Adoption of all other changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. 
    
  Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption 
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers   - In May 2014, August 2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance that will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. All arrangements involving the transfer of goods or services to customers are within the scope of the guidance, except for certain contracts subject to other U.S. GAAP guidance, including lease contracts and rights and obligations related to financial instruments. The standard s core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also includes new disclosure requirements related to the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the Company s financial statements beginning January 1, 2018. The guidance allows an entity to apply the new standard either retrospectively or through a cumulative-effect adjustment as of January 1, 2018. We have elected to implement this new accounting guidance using a cumulative-effect adjustment. This guidance does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including loans and securities that are accounted for under other U.S. GAAP guidance. For that reason, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations for elements of the statement of income associated with financial instruments, including securities gains, interest income and interest

     Table of Contents  

expense. The Company is continuing to evaluate the effect of the new guidance on revenue sources other than financial instruments on our financial position and consolidated results of operations. 
    
  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   - In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance requires new disclosures to the extent management concludes there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance will be effective for the Company s annual financial statements dated December 31, 2016, as well as interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or consolidated results of operations. 
    
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   - In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for certain financial asset and financial liabilities. The guidance will require the Company to (1) measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, (2) record changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured under the fair value option in other comprehensive income, and (3) assess the realizability of deferred tax assets related to available-for-sale debt securities in combination with the Company s other deferred tax assets. The standard does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. The guidance amends certain disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance will be effective for the Company s financial statements that include periods beginning January 1, 2018. Certain provisions of the standard will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment as of January 1, 2018, and other provisions will be applied prospectively. The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the new guidance on our financial position and consolidated results of operations. 
    
  Leases   - In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, lessees will need to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for the vast majority of leases. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. Lessor accounting will remain similar to the current model. Lessors will classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type, consistent with the current model. The new guidance will also require extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures related to the revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized over the lease term, as well as significant judgments made by management. The guidance will be effective for the Company s financial statements that include periods beginning January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be applied using a modified retrospective transition. The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the new guidance on our financial position and consolidated results of operations. 
    
  Measure of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   - In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. For financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures (including loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, and loan commitments), the new guidance will require the Company to record an allowance based on the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the financial instrument or pool of financial instruments. The estimate of lifetime expected credit losses must consider historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The new guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. The new guidance will require the Company to record an allowance for estimated credit losses on available-for-sale securities when the fair value of the security is below the amortized cost of the asset. Additionally, the guidance expands the disclosure requirements related to the Company s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for credit losses. The guidance will be effective for the Company s financial statements that include periods beginning January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted beginning January 1, 2019. The new standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the new guidance on our financial position and consolidated results of operations. 
    
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   - In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for the Company s financial statements that include periods beginning January 1, 2018, as well as interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The guidance should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the new guidance on our financial position and consolidated results of operations.

  Securities Portfolio 
  (Amounts in thousands) 

The carrying value of securities pledged to secure public deposits, FHLB advances, trust deposits, Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB ) discount window borrowing availability, derivative transactions, and standby letters of credit with counterparty banks and for other purposes as permitted or required by law totaled   $400.0 million   and   $421.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Of total pledged securities, securities pledged to creditors under agreements pursuant to which the collateral may be sold or re-pledged by the secured parties totaled   $104.7 million   and   $100.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Excluding securities issued or backed by the U.S. Government, its agencies and U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, there were   no   investments in securities from one issuer that exceeded   10%   of consolidated equity at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

The following table presents the fair values of securities with unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The securities presented are grouped according to the time periods during which the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. 
    
  Securities in Unrealized Loss Position 
  (Amounts in thousands) 

There were   $50.9 million   of securities with   $508,000   in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months at   September 30, 2016  . At   December 31, 2015  , there were   $248.5 million   of securities with   $5.8 million   in an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months. The Company does not consider these unrealized losses to be credit-related. These unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates and market spreads. We do not intend to sell the securities and we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity.

     Table of Contents  

We conduct a quarterly assessment of our investment portfolio to determine whether any securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified three municipal debt securities from the same issuer totaling   $1.1 million  , which had credit rating downgrades during the period. We determined that the difference between amortized cost and fair value was other-than-temporary and accordingly, recognized the   $466,000   difference as a component of net securities gains in the consolidated statement of income. The securities were sold in January 2016 with no further losses recognized.   No   other securities were considered other-than-temporary impaired during the first   nine months   of 2016. 
    
  The following table presents the remaining contractual maturity of securities as of   September 30, 2016  , by amortized cost and fair value.

Impaired Loans 
    
  Impaired loans consist of nonaccrual loans (which include nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs )) and loans classified as accruing TDRs. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, either (i) management believes that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due (both principal and interest) according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, or (ii) it has been classified as a TDR due to providing a concession to a borrower that is inconsistent with the risk profile.

Credit Quality Indicators 
    
  We attempt to mitigate risk through loan structure, collateral, monitoring, and other credit risk management controls. We have adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for credit quality with a numerical rating of   1   through   8  . Loans rated   5   and better (  1  -  5   ratings, inclusive) are considered  pass  rated credits that we believe exhibit acceptable financial performance, cash flow, and leverage. Credits rated   6   are performing in accordance with contractual terms but are considered  special mention  as they demonstrate potential weakness that, if left unresolved, may result in deterioration in our credit position and/or the repayment prospects for the credit. Borrowers rated special mention may exhibit adverse operating trends, high leverage, tight liquidity or other credit concerns. Loans rated   7   may be classified as either accruing ( potential problem ) or nonaccrual ( nonperforming ). Potential problem loans, like special mention, are loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms, but for which management has some level of concern (greater than that of special mention loans) about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms in future periods. Potential problem loans continue to accrue interest but the ultimate collection of these loans in full is a risk due to the same conditions that characterize a   6  -rated credit. These credits may also have somewhat increased risk profiles as a result of the current net worth and/or paying capacity of the obligor or guarantors or a declining value of the collateral pledged. These loans generally have a well-defined weakness that may jeopardize collection of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we may sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not resolved. Although these loans are generally identified as potential problem loans and require additional attention by management, they may never become nonperforming. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans risk-rated   7   or   8   and have all the weaknesses inherent in a   7  -rated potential problem loan with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently-existing facts, conditions and values, a more remote possibility. Special mention, potential problem and nonperforming loans are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis, while all other rated credits over a certain dollar threshold, depending on loan type, are reviewed annually or more frequently as the circumstances warrant.

  At the time an accruing loan becomes modified and meets the definition of a TDR, it is considered impaired and no longer included as part of the general loan loss reserve population. However, our general reserve methodology considers a pro-rated amount and product type of the TDRs removed as a proxy for potentially heightened risk in the portfolio when establishing final reserve requirements. 
    
  As impaired loans, TDRs (both accruing and nonaccruing) are evaluated for impairment at the end of each quarter with a specific valuation reserve created, or adjusted (either individually or as part of a pool), if necessary, as a component of the allowance for loan losses. Our allowance for loan losses included   $3.4 million   and   $3.9 million   in specific reserves for nonaccrual TDRs at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. For accruing TDRs, there were   $872,000   and   $4,000   in specific reserves at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , a single commercial loan totaling   $4.1 million   became nonperforming within 12 months of being modified as an accruing TDR. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a single commercial real estate loan totaling   $175,000   became nonperforming within 12 months of being modified as an accruing TDR. A loan typically becomes nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status when the principal or interest payments are 90 days past due based on contractual terms or when an individual analysis of a borrower s creditworthiness indicates a loan should be placed on nonaccrual status earlier than the 90-day past due date.

Goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests at least on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances occur that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of   October 31, 2015  , and it was determined   no   impairment existed as of that date nor are we aware of any events or circumstances that would indicate goodwill is impaired at   September 30, 2016  . There were   no   impairment charges for goodwill recorded in   2015  . Our annual goodwill test will be completed during fourth quarter   2016  . 
    
  We have other intangible assets capitalized on the consolidated statements of financial condition in the form of core deposit premiums and client relationships. These intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from   8   to   12 years  .  
    
  We review other intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there were no events or circumstances that we believe indicate there may be impairment of other intangible assets, and   no   impairment charges for other intangible assets were recorded for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

    Our borrowing capacity changes each quarter subject to available collateral and FRB discount factors. 
               (3)   
    As a member of the FHLB Chicago, the Bank has access to borrowing capacity which is subject to change based on the availability of acceptable collateral to pledge and the level of our investment in FHLB Chicago stock. At   September 30, 2016  , our borrowing capacity was   $2.1 billion  , of which   $839.9 million   was available, subject to making the required additional investment in FHLB Chicago stock. 
       
  Borrowings with maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term. 
    
  FHLB Advances -   At   September 30, 2016  , FHLB advances totaled   $1.3 billion  , consisting of   $1.2 billion   in short-term borrowings, and   $50.0 million   classified as long-term debt. Qualifying residential, multi-family and commercial real estate ( CRE ) loans, home equity lines of credit, and residential mortgage-backed securities are pledged as collateral to secure current outstanding balances and additional borrowing availability. 
    
  Other Borrowings -   At   September 30, 2016  , other borrowings consisted of the Company s obligation to a third party bank under a commercial credit card servicing arrangement. At December 31, 2015, other borrowings represented cash received by counterparty in excess of derivative liability. 
    
  Secured Borrowings -   Secured borrowings represent amounts related to certain loan participation agreements on loans we originated that were classified as secured borrowings because they did not qualify for sale accounting treatment. A corresponding amount is recorded within loans on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 
    
  Revolving Line of Credit -   The Company has a 364-day revolving line of credit (the  Facility ) with a group of commercial banks allowing borrowing of up to   $60.0 million  , and maturing on the earlier of   September 22, 2017   or the consummation of the Company s merger with CIBC. The interest rate applied to borrowings under the Facility will be elected by the Company at the time an advance is made; interest rate elections include either 30-day or 90-day LIBOR plus   1.75%   or Prime minus   0.50%   at the time the advance is made. Any amounts outstanding under the Facility upon or before maturity may be converted, at the Company s option, to an amortizing term loan, with the balance of such loan due   September 22, 2019   (subject to earlier maturity upon consummation of the merger with CIBC, as previously noted). At   September 30, 2016  ,   no   amounts were drawn on the Facility.

    As of   December 31, 2015  , amounts reported included three long-term advances totaling   $45.0 million   with a weighted average interest rate of   3.66%  . The advances provided a one-time option to increase the amount outstanding up to   $150.0 million   each at the same fixed rate as the original advance. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, two of the options expired. As of   September 30, 2016  , one long-term advance of   $15.0 million   provided a one-time option, set to expire prior to December 31, 2016, to increase the amount outstanding up to   $150.0 million   at the same fixed rate of   3.58%  . The advances include a prepayment feature and are subject to a prepayment fee. 
       
  The   $167.6 million   in junior subordinated debentures presented in the table above were issued to four separate wholly-owned trusts for the purpose of issuing Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. Refer to   Note 10   for further information on the nature and terms of these and previously issued debentures. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , outstanding long-term FHLB advances were secured by qualifying residential, multi-family, CRE, and home equity lines of credit. From time to time, we may pledge eligible real estate mortgage-backed securities to support additional borrowings.

10.   JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES HELD BY TRUSTS THAT ISSUED TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we sponsored and wholly owned   100%   of the common equity of   four   trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities ( Trust Preferred Securities ) to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities solely in a series of junior subordinated debentures of the Company ( Debentures ). The Debentures held by the trusts, which in aggregate totaled   $167.6 million  , net of deferred financing costs, at   September 30, 2016  , are the sole assets of each respective trust. Our obligations under the Debentures and related documents constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company on a subordinated basis of all payments on the Trust Preferred Securities. We currently have the right to redeem, in whole or in part, subject to any required regulatory approval, all or any series of the Debentures at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The repayment, redemption or repurchase of any of the Debentures would be subject to the terms of the applicable indenture and result in a corresponding repayment, redemption or repurchase of an equivalent amount of the related series of Trust Preferred Securities. Any redemption of the 10% Debentures held by the PrivateBancorp Capital Trust IV also would be subject to the terms of the replacement capital covenant described below. 
    
  In connection with the issuance in 2008 of the 10% Debentures, which rank junior to the other Debentures, we entered into a replacement capital covenant that relates to the redemption of the 10% Debentures and the related Trust Preferred Securities.   Under the replacement capital covenant, as amended in October 2012, we committed, for the benefit of certain debt holders, that we would not repay, redeem or repurchase the 10% Debentures or the related Trust Preferred Securities prior to June 2048 unless we have (1) obtained any required regulatory approval, and (2) raised certain amounts of qualifying equity or equity-like replacement capital at any time after October 10, 2012.   The replacement capital covenant benefits holders of our  covered debt  as specified under the terms of the replacement capital covenant. Currently, under the replacement capital covenant, the  covered debt  is the Debentures held by PrivateBancorp Statutory Trust II. In the event that the Company s   7.125%   subordinated debentures due   2042   are designated as or become the covered debt under the replacement capital covenant, the terms of such debentures provide that the Company is authorized to terminate the replacement capital covenant without any further action or payment. We may amend or terminate the replacement capital covenant in certain circumstances without the consent of the holders of the covered debt.  
    
  Under current accounting rules, the trusts qualify as variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore are ineligible for consolidation in our financial statements. The Debentures issued by us to the trusts are included in our consolidated statements of financial condition as  long-term debt  with the corresponding interest distributions recorded as interest expense. The common shares issued by the trusts and held by us are included in other assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition with the related dividend distributions recorded in other non-interest income.

The coupon rate for PrivateBancorp Capital Trust IV is fixed. Distributions on all Trust Preferred Securities are payable quarterly. We have the right to defer payment of interest on the Debentures at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding ten years, in the case of the Debentures held by Trust IV, and five years, in the case of all other Debentures, without causing an event of default under the related indenture, provided no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the Debentures. During such extension period, distributions on the Trust Preferred Securities would also be deferred, and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock would generally be prohibited. The Federal Reserve has the ability to prevent interest payments on the Debentures.

  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had authority to issue   180 million   shares of capital stock, consisting of   one million   shares of preferred stock,   five million   shares of non-voting common stock and   174 million   shares of voting common stock. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   no   shares of preferred stock or non-voting common stock were issued or outstanding. The Company had   79.6 million   and   79.1 million   shares of voting common stock issued and outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Company reissues treasury stock, when available, or new shares to fulfill its obligation to issue shares granted pursuant to the share-based compensation plans. Treasury shares are reissued at average cost. The Company held   no   shares in treasury at   September 30, 2016   and   2,574   in treasury at   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

At   September 30, 2016  , we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and, accordingly,   no   valuation allowance was recorded. This conclusion was based in part on our recent earnings history, on both a book and tax basis, and our outlook for earnings and taxable income in future periods. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $2.5 million   and   $126,000  , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months, the Company does not anticipate this change will have a material impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company. 

14.   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
    
  We utilize an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce both interest rate risk (relating to mortgage loan commitments and planned sales of loans) and foreign currency risk (relating to certain loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar). We also use these instruments to accommodate our clients as we provide them with risk management solutions. None of the client-related and other end-user derivatives, noted in the table below, were designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .

  Derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk. Credit risk is managed through our standard underwriting process. Actual exposures are monitored against various types of credit limits established to contain risk within parameters. Additionally, credit risk is managed through the use of collateral, netting agreements, and the establishment of internal concentration limits by financial institution. 
    
  Certain of our derivative contracts contain embedded credit risk contingent features that if triggered allow the derivative counterparty to terminate the derivative or require additional collateral. These contingent features are triggered if we do not meet specified financial performance indicators such as minimum capital ratios under the federal banking agencies  guidelines. All such  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

requirements were met at   September 30, 2016  . The fair value of the derivatives with credit contingency features in a net liability position at   September 30, 2016   totaled   $13.4 million   and   $14.9 million   of collateral was posted for these transactions. If the credit risk contingency features were triggered at   September 30, 2016  ,   no   additional collateral would be required to be posted to derivative counterparties and   $13.4 million   in outstanding derivative instruments would be immediately settled. 
    
  Derivatives Designated in Hedge Relationships 
    
  We use interest rate derivatives to hedge variability in forecasted interest cash flows in our loan portfolio which is comprised primarily of floating-rate loans. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of our hedging program is to use interest rate derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges     Under our cash flow hedging program, we enter into receive fixed/pay variable interest rate swaps to convert certain floating-rate commercial loan cash flows to fixed-rate to reduce the variability in forecasted interest cash flows due to market interest rate changes. We use regression analysis to assess the effectiveness of cash flow hedges at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness is generally measured as the amount by which the cumulative change in fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative change in the expected cash flows of the hedged item. Measured ineffectiveness is recognized directly in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there were   no   gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives related to ineffectiveness that were reclassified to current earnings. The effective portion of the gains or losses on cash flow hedges are recorded, net of tax, in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to interest income on loans in the period that the hedged interest cash flows affect earnings. As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum length of time over which forecasted interest cash flows are hedged is approximately   four years  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $3.0 million   in net deferred   gains  , net of tax, recorded in AOCI are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to   September 30, 2016  . There are   no   components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to our cash flow hedge strategy. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , there were   no   gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified to current earnings because it became probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur. Refer to   Note 11   for additional information regarding the changes in AOCI related to the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. 
    
  Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge Relationships 
    
  Client-Related Derivatives     We offer, through our capital markets group, over-the-counter interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to our clients, including but not limited to, interest rate swaps, interest rate options (also referred to as caps, floors, collars, etc.), foreign exchange forwards and options, as well as cash products such as foreign exchange spot transactions. When our clients enter into an interest rate or foreign exchange derivative transaction with us, we mitigate our exposure to market risk through the execution of off-setting positions with inter-bank dealer counterparties. Although the off-setting nature of transactions originated by our capital markets group limits our market risk exposure, they do expose us to other risks including counterparty credit, settlement, and operational risk. 
    
  To accommodate our loan clients, we occasionally enter into risk participation agreements ( RPAs ) with counterparty banks to either accept or transfer a portion of the credit risk related to their interest rate derivatives or transfer a portion of the credit risk related to our interest rate derivatives. This allows clients to execute an interest rate derivative with one bank while allowing for distribution of the credit risk among participating members. We have entered into written RPAs in which we accept a portion of the credit risk associated with an interest rate derivative of another bank s loan client in exchange for a fee. We manage this credit risk through our loan underwriting process, and when appropriate, the RPA is backed by collateral provided by the clients under their loan agreement. 
    
  The current payment/performance risk of written RPAs is assessed using internal risk ratings which range from   1   to   8   with the latter representing the highest credit risk. The risk rating is based on several factors including the financial condition of the RPA s underlying derivative counterparty, present economic conditions, performance trends, leverage, and liquidity. 
    
  The maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments that we could be required to make under our written RPAs assumes that the underlying derivative counterparty defaults and that the floating interest rate index of the underlying derivative remains at zero percent. In the event that we would have to pay out any amounts under our RPAs, we will seek to maximize the recovery of these amounts from assets that our clients pledged as collateral for the derivative and the related loan.

Other End-User Derivatives     We use forward commitments to sell to-be-announced securities and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the change in fair value of customer interest rate lock commitments and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. The forward commitments to sell and the interest rate lock commitments are considered derivatives. At   September 30, 2016  , the par value of our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale totaled   $28.3 million  , the notional value of our interest rate lock commitments totaled   $54.8 million  , and the notional value of our forward commitments to sell totaled   $99.6 million  . 
    
  We are also exposed at times to foreign exchange risk as a result of originating loans in which the principal and interest are settled in a currency other than U.S. dollars. As of   September 30, 2016  , our exposure was to the   Euro, Canadian dollar, Danish kroner, British pound and Australian dollar   on   $43.8 million   of loans. We manage this risk using forward currency derivatives. 
    
  Additionally, in connection with certain negotiated credit facilities, we receive warrants to acquire stock in privately-held client companies and are considered derivatives under current accounting standards. As of   September 30, 2016  , warrants totaled   $216,000  .

     Table of Contents  

accounting guidance permits the netting of financial assets and liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between us and a counterparty. A master netting agreement is an agreement between two counterparties who have multiple financial contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract. For those financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting agreements, assets and liabilities, and related cash collateral, with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis within the assets and liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 
    
  Derivative contracts may require us to provide or receive cash or financial instrument collateral. Collateral associated with derivative assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting agreements with the same counterparty is posted on a net basis. We have pledged cash or financial collateral in accordance with each counterparty s collateral posting requirements for all of the Company s derivative assets and liabilities in a net liability position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Certain collateral posting requirements are subject to posting thresholds and minimum transfer amounts, such that we are only required to post collateral once the posting threshold is met, and any adjustments to the amount of collateral posted must meet minimum transfer amounts. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $39.9 million   and   $17.8 million   of cash collateral pledged, respectively, was netted with the related financial liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. To the extent not netted against fair values under a master netting agreement, the excess collateral received or pledged is included in other short-term borrowings or other investments, respectively. There was   no   excess cash collateral pledged at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Any securities pledged to counterparties as financial instrument collateral remain on the consolidated statements of financial condition as long as we do not default.

16.   COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
    
  Credit Extension Commitments and Guarantees 
    
  In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our clients and to conduct lending activities. These instruments principally include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and liquidity risk in excess of the amounts reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition. 

37 

     Table of Contents  

Contractual or Notional Amounts of Financial Instruments    (1)   
  (Amounts in thousands) 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to, or issue letters of credit for the account of, a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the credit agreement. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and variable interest rates tied to the prime rate or LIBOR and may require payment of a fee for the unused portion of the commitment or for the amounts issued but not drawn on letters of credit. All or a portion of unfunded commitments require regulatory capital support, except for unfunded commitments of less than one year that are unconditionally cancellable. Since many of our commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the borrowers. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a reserve for unfunded commitments of   $15.6 million  , which reflects our estimate of inherent losses associated with these commitment obligations. The balance of this reserve changes based on a number of factors, including the balance of outstanding commitments and our assessment of the likelihood of borrowers to utilize these commitments. The reserve is recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition. 
    
  Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. Standby letters of credit include performance and financial guarantees for clients in connection with contracts between our clients and third parties. Standby letters of credit are agreements where we are obligated to make payment to a third party on behalf of a client in the event the client fails to meet their contractual obligations. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn upon when the underlying transaction is consummated between the client and the third party. In most cases, the Company receives a fee for the amount of a letter of credit issued but not drawn upon. 
    
  In the event of a client s nonperformance, our credit loss exposure is equal to the contractual amount of those commitments. We manage this credit risk in a similar manner to evaluating credit risk in extending loans to clients under our credit policies. We use the same credit policies in making credit commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments, mitigating exposure to credit loss through various collateral requirements, if deemed necessary. In the event of nonperformance by the clients, we have rights to the underlying collateral, which could include CRE, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and marketable securities. 
    
  The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us under standby letters of credit arrangements are equal to the contractual amount of the commitment. The unamortized fees associated with standby letters of credit, which are included in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition, totaled   $2.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . We amortize these amounts into income over the commitment period. As of   September 30, 2016  , standby letters of credit had a remaining weighted-average term of approximately   15 months  , with remaining actual lives ranging from less than   1 year   to   6 years  .

Other Commitments 
    
  The Company has unfunded commitments to CRA investments and other investment partnerships totaling   $40.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Of these commitments,   $29.7 million   related to legally-binding unfunded commitments for tax-credit investments and was included within other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 
    
  Credit Card Settlement Guarantees 
    
  Our third-party corporate credit card provider issues corporate purchase credit cards on behalf of our commercial clients. The corporate purchase credit cards are issued to employees of certain of our commercial clients at the client s direction and used for payment of business-related expenses. In most circumstances, these cards will be underwritten by our third-party provider. However, in certain circumstances, we may enter into a recourse agreement, which transfers the credit risk from the third-party provider to us in the event that the client fails to meet its financial payment obligation. In these circumstances, a total maximum exposure amount is established for our corporate client. In addition to the obligations presented in the prior table, the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us under this third-party settlement guarantee were   $18.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We believe that the estimated amounts of maximum potential future payments are not representative of our actual potential loss given our insignificant historical losses from this third-party settlement guarantee program. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   recorded contingent liability in the consolidated financial statements for this settlement guarantee program, and management believes that the probability of any loss under this arrangement is remote. 
    
  Mortgage Loans Sold with Recourse 
    
  Certain mortgage loans sold in the secondary market have limited recourse provisions. The losses for the   three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , arising from limited recourse provisions were   not material  . Based on this experience, the Company has not established any liability for potential future losses relating to mortgage loans sold in prior periods. 
    
  Legal Proceedings 
    
  Since the announcement of the proposed transaction with CIBC, three stockholders of the Company have filed separate putative class actions on behalf of our public stockholders in the Cook County Circuit Court, Chicago, Illinois. The three actions have been consolidated and styled   In re PrivateBancorp, Inc. Shareholder Litigation  , 2016-CH-08949. All of the actions name as defendants the Company and each of its directors individually. The complaints assert that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed transaction. Two of the complaints are also brought against CIBC and assert that the Company and CIBC aided and abetted the directors  alleged breaches. The actions broadly allege that the transaction was the result of a flawed process, that the price is unfair, and that certain provisions of the merger agreement might dissuade a potential suitor from making a competing offer, among other things. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint, adding a claim alleging breaches of the fiduciary duty of disclosure by the directors. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, including damages. The plaintiffs in the three actions recently have agreed in principle not to pursue the actions as a result of the inclusion of certain additional disclosures in the proxy statement for the Company s special meeting of stockholders. The defendants, including the Company, believe the demands and complaints are without merit and there are substantial legal and factual defenses to the claims asserted.    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   and in the ordinary course of business, there were various other legal proceedings pending against the Company and our subsidiaries that are incidental to our regular business operations. Management does not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.    

17.   ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  We measure, monitor, and disclose certain of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis to account for securities available-for-sale, mortgage loans held-for-sale, derivative assets, derivative liabilities, and certain other assets and other liabilities. In addition, fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to apply lower-of-cost-or-market accounting to foreclosed real estate and certain other loans held-for-sale, evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment, including collateral-dependent impaired loans, and for disclosure purposes. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, we use various valuation techniques and input assumptions when estimating fair value. 
    
  U.S. GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels based  
  
   39 

     Table of Contents  

on the reliability of the input assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows: 

Level 1   Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets. 
                
    Level 2   Observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
                
    Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  
       
  The categorization of where an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
    
  Valuation Methodology  
    
  We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. However, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value. Additionally, the methods used may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. 
    
  The following describes the valuation methodologies we use for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including the general classification of the assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
    
  Securities Available-for-Sale     Securities available-for-sale include U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agencies, collateralized mortgage obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities, and foreign sovereign debt. Substantially all available-for-sale securities are fixed-income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but may be traded in active markets. The fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from external pricing services. The principal markets for our securities portfolio are the secondary institutional markets, with an exit price that is predominantly reflective of bid level pricing in those markets. U.S. Treasury securities have been classified in level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. All other remaining securities are generally classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where significant credit valuation adjustments are incorporated into the estimation of fair value, reported amounts are classified as level 3. On a quarterly basis, the Company uses a variety of methods to validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from external pricing services, including evaluating pricing service inputs and methodologies, using exception reports based on analytical criteria, comparing prices obtained to prices received from other pricing sources, and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on the Company s knowledge of market liquidity and other market-related conditions. 
    
  Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale     Mortgage loans held-for-sale represent residential mortgage loan originations intended to be sold in the secondary market. We have elected the fair value option for residential mortgage loans originated with the intention of selling to a third party. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for these loans with the related mortgage banking derivatives used to economically hedge them. These mortgage loans are measured at fair value as of each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognized through mortgage banking non-interest income. The fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale is determined based on prices obtained for loans with similar characteristics from third-party sources. On a quarterly basis, the Company validates the overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from third-party sources by comparing prices obtained to prices received from various other pricing sources, and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on Company knowledge of market liquidity and other market-related conditions. Mortgage loans held-for-sale are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
    
  Residential Real Estate Loans Fair Value Option     Residential real estate loans fair value option represent residential real estate loans that originated as held-for-sale and subsequently transferred to loans held for investment. Similar to the mortgage loans held-for-sale, we have elected the fair value option for these loans. These residential real estate loans are measured at fair value as of each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognized through mortgage banking non-interest income. The fair value of these residential real estate loans is determined based on prices obtained for loans with similar characteristics from third-party sources. On a quarterly basis, the Company validates the overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from third-party sources by comparing prices obtained to prices received from various other pricing sources, and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on Company knowledge of market liquidity and other market-related conditions. Residential real estate loans fair value option are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Collateral-Dependent Impaired Loans     We do not record loans held for investment at fair value on a recurring basis. However, periodically, we record nonrecurring adjustments to reduce the carrying value of certain impaired loans based on fair value measurement. This population of impaired loans includes those for which repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. We measure the fair value of collateral-dependent impaired loans based on the fair value of the collateral securing these loans less estimated selling costs. A majority of collateral-dependent impaired loans are secured by real estate with the fair value generally determined based upon appraisals performed by a certified or licensed appraiser using a combination of valuation techniques such as sales comparison, income capitalization and cost approach and include inputs such as absorption rates, capitalization rates and comparables. We also consider other factors or recent developments that could result in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals. When a collateral-dependent loan is secured by non-real estate collateral such as receivables, inventory, or equipment, the fair value is generally determined based upon appraisals, field exams, or receivable reports. The valuation techniques and inputs are reviewed internally by an asset-based specialist for reasonableness of estimated liquidation costs, collectability probabilities, and other market data. Accordingly, fair value estimates for collateral-dependent impaired loans are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The carrying value of all impaired loans and the related specific reserves are disclosed in   Note 4  . 
    
  At the time a collateral-dependent loan is initially determined to be impaired, we review the existing appraisal. If the most recent appraisal is greater than one-year old, a new appraisal of the underlying collateral is obtained. For collateral-dependent impaired loans that are secured by real estate, we generally obtain  as is  appraisal values to evaluate impairment. When a collateral-dependent loan is secured by non-real estate collateral such as receivables, inventory, or equipment, the fair value is generally determined based on appraisals, field exams, or receivable reports. The valuation techniques and inputs are reviewed internally by workout and/or asset-based specialists for reasonableness of estimated liquidation costs, collectability probabilities, and other market data. Appraisals for real estate collateral-dependent impaired loans in excess of $500,000 are updated with new independent appraisals at least annually and are formally reviewed by our internal appraisal department. Additional diligence is performed at the six-month interval between annual appraisals. If during the course of the six-month review process there is evidence supporting a meaningful decline in the value of collateral, the appraised value is either adjusted downward or a new appraisal is required to support the value of the impaired loan  . As part of our internal review process, we consider other factors or recent developments that could adjust the valuations indicated in the appraisals or internal reviews. The Company s internal appraisal review process validates the reasonableness of appraisals in conjunction with analyzing sales and market data from an array of market sources. 
    
  Covered Asset OREO and OREO     Covered asset OREO and OREO generated from our originated book of business are valued on a nonrecurring basis using third-party appraisals of each property and our judgment of other relevant market conditions and are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. As part of our internal review process, we consider other factors or recent developments that could adjust the valuations indicated in the appraisals or internal reviews. Updated appraisals on both OREO portfolios are typically obtained every twelve months and evaluated internally at least every six months. In addition, both property-specific and market-specific factors as well as collateral type factors are taken into consideration, which may result in obtaining more frequent appraisal updates or internal assessments. Appraisals are conducted by third-party independent appraisers under internal direction and engagement using a combination of valuation techniques such as sales comparison, income capitalization and cost approach and include inputs such as absorption rates, capitalization rate and comparables. Any appraisal with a value in excess of   $250,000   is subject to a compliance review. Appraisals received with a value in excess of   $1.0 million   are subject to a technical review. Appraisals are either reviewed internally by our appraisal department or sent to an outside technical firm if appropriate. Both levels of review involve a scope appropriate for the complexity and risk associated with the OREO. To validate the reasonableness of the appraisals obtained, the Company compares the appraised value to the actual sales price of properties sold and analyzes the reasons why a property may be sold for less than its appraised value. 
    
  Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities     Derivative instruments with positive fair values are reported as an asset and derivative instruments with negative fair value are reported as liabilities, in both cases after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. For derivative counterparties, we measure nonperformance risk on the basis of each exposure to the counterparty. The fair value of derivative assets and liabilities is determined based on prices obtained from third-party advisors using standardized industry models, or based on quoted market prices obtained from external pricing services. Many factors affect derivative values, including the level of interest rates, the market s perception of our nonperformance risk as reflected in our credit spread, and our assessment of counterparty nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk assessment is based on our evaluation of credit risk, or if available, on observable external assessments of credit risk. Values of derivative assets and liabilities are primarily based on observable inputs and are classified in level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, with the exception of certain client-related derivatives, RPAs, interest rate lock commitments and warrants, as discussed below. On a quarterly basis, the Company uses a variety of methods to validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values obtained from third-party advisors, including evaluating inputs and methodologies used by the third-party advisors, comparing prices obtained to prices received from other pricing sources, and reviewing the reasonableness of prices based on the Company s knowledge of market liquidity and other market-related conditions. While we may challenge valuation inputs used in determining prices obtained from third parties based on our validation procedures,  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we did not alter the fair values ultimately provided by the third-party advisors. 
    
  Level 3 derivatives include RPAs, derivatives associated with clients whose loans are risk rated 6 or higher ( watch list derivative ), interest rate lock commitments and warrants. Refer to  Credit Quality Indicators  in   Note 4   for further discussion of risk ratings. For the level 3 RPAs, watch list derivatives, the Company obtains prices from third-party advisors, consistent with the valuation processes employed for the Company s derivatives classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and then applies loss factors to adjust the prices obtained from third-party advisors. The significant unobservable inputs that are employed in the valuation process for the RPAs and watch list derivatives that cause these derivatives to be classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are the historic loss factors specific to the particular industry segment and risk rating category. The loss factors are updated quarterly and are derived and aligned with the loss factors utilized in the calculation of the Company s general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses. Changes in the fair value measurement of RPAs and watch list derivatives are largely due to changes in the fair value of the derivative, risk rating adjustments and fluctuations in the pertinent historic average loss rate. For the interest rate lock commitments on mortgage loans, the fair value is based on prices obtained for loans with similar characteristics from third-party sources, adjusted for the probability that the interest rate lock commitment will fund (the  pull-through  rate). The significant unobservable input that causes these derivatives to be classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy is the pull-through rate. Pull-through rates are derived using the Company s historical data and reflect the Company s best estimate of the likelihood that a committed loan will ultimately fund. Significant increases in this input in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement and significant decreases would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. The fair value of our warrants to acquire stock in privately-held client companies is based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model that estimates the asset value by using stated strike prices, estimated stock prices, option expiration dates, risk-free interest rates based on a duration-matched U.S. Treasury rate, and option volatility assumptions. The significant unobservable inputs that cause these derivatives to be classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are the estimated stock prices, adjustments to the option expiration dates, and option volatility assumptions. The estimated stock prices are based on the most recent valuation of the privately-held client company, adjusted as deemed appropriate for changes in relevant market conditions. Option expiration dates are modified to account for the estimated actual remaining life relative to the stated expiration of the warrants. The option volatility assumptions are based on the volatility of publicly-traded companies that operate in similar industries as the privately-held client companies. Significant increases in these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher fair value measurement and significant decreases would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement.

    Fair value is presented prior to giving effect to netting adjustments. 
               (2)   
    Amounts disclosed in this line are included in the consolidated statements of income as capital markets products income for derivatives and mortgage banking income for interest rate lock commitments. 
               (3)   
    Transfers in and transfers out are recognized at the end of each quarterly reporting period. In general, derivative assets and liabilities are transferred into Level 3 from Level 2 due to a lack of observable market data, as there was deterioration in the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. Conversely, derivative assets and liabilities are transferred out of Level 3 into Level 2 due to an improvement in the credit risk of the derivative counterparty.

(1)   
    The change in fair value is reflected in mortgage banking non-interest income. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   none   of the mortgage loans held-for-sale or residential real estate loans fair value option were on nonaccrual or 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were   not material  . 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
    
  From time to time, we may be required to measure certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-fair-value accounting or write-downs of individual assets when there is evidence of impairment. 
    
  The following table provides the fair value of those assets that were subject to fair value adjustments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and still held at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. All fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis were measured using level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

    Represents the fair value of loans adjusted to the appraised value of the collateral with a change in specific reserves during the respective period. These fair value adjustments are recorded against the allowance for loan losses. 
               (2)   
    Represents the fair value of foreclosed properties that were adjusted subsequent to their initial classification as foreclosed assets. Write-downs are recognized as a component of net foreclosed property expenses in the consolidated statements of income. 
       
  There have been   no   changes in the valuation techniques we used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis from   December 31, 2015  , to   September 30, 2016  .

    Represents fair value of underlying swap. 
       
  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the watch list derivatives and RPAs are the historic loss factors. A significant increase (decrease) in the pertinent loss factor would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
    
  Estimated Fair Value of Certain Financial Instruments 
    
  U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair values of certain financial instruments, both assets and liabilities, on-and off-balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate fair value. Because the disclosure of estimated fair values provided herein excludes the fair value of certain other financial instruments and all non-financial instruments, any aggregation of the estimated fair value amounts presented would not represent total underlying value. Examples of non-financial instruments having value not disclosed herein include the future earnings potential of significant customer relationships and the value of our asset management operations and other fee-generating businesses. In addition, other significant assets including property, plant, and equipment and goodwill are not considered financial instruments and, therefore, have not been included in the disclosure. 
    
  Various methodologies and assumptions have been utilized in management s determination of the estimated fair value of our financial instruments, which are detailed below. The fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time based on relevant market information. Because no market exists for a significant portion of these financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected economic conditions, loss experience, and risk characteristics of the financial instruments. These estimates are subjective, involve uncertainties, and cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
    
  In addition to the valuation methodology explained above for financial instruments recorded at fair value, the following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments that are carried at cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition and includes the general classification of the assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
    
  Short-term financial assets and liabilities     For financial instruments with a shorter-term or with no stated maturity, prevailing market rates, and limited credit risk, the carrying amounts approximate fair value. Those financial instruments include cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in banks (including the receivable for cash collateral pledged),  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

accrued interest receivable, and accrued interest payable. Accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable are classified consistent with the hierarchy of their corresponding assets and liabilities. 
    
  Other loans held-for-sale -   Included in loans held-for sale at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are   $46.9 million   and   $73.1 million  , respectively, of loans carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Fair value estimates are based on the actual agreed upon price in the agreement. 
    
  Securities held-to-maturity     Securities held-to-maturity include collateralized mortgage obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal securities. Substantially all held-to-maturity securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but may be traded in active markets. The fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from external pricing services. The principal markets for our securities portfolio are the secondary institutional markets, with an exit price that is predominantly reflective of bid level pricing in those markets. 
    
  FHLB stock     The carrying value of FHLB stock approximates fair value as the stock is non-marketable, and can only be sold to the FHLB or another member institution at par. 
    
  Loans     Other than certain residential real estate loans accounted for under the fair value option, the fair value of loans is calculated by discounting estimated cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan. Cash flows are estimated by applying contractual payment terms to assumed interest rates. The estimate of maturity is based on contractual terms and includes assumptions that reflect our and the industry s historical experience with repayments for each loan classification. The estimation is modified, as required, by the effect of current economic and lending conditions, collateral, and other factors. 
    
  Covered assets     Covered assets include acquired loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under a loss share agreement with the FDIC (including the fair value of expected reimbursements from the FDIC). The fair value of covered assets is calculated by discounting contractual cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the asset. The estimate of maturity is based on contractual terms and includes assumptions that reflect our and the industry s historical experience with repayments for each asset classification. The estimate is modified, as required, by the effect of current economic and lending conditions, collateral, and other factors. 
    
  Investment in BOLI     The cash surrender value of our investment in bank owned life insurance approximates the fair value. 
    
  Community reinvestment investments   -     The fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach (discounted cash flow) that incorporates current market rates. 
    
  Deposit liabilities     The fair values disclosed for noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits, and money market deposits are approximately equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The fair values for certificates of deposit and time deposits were estimated using present value techniques by discounting the future cash flows at rates based on internal models and broker quotes. 
    
  Short-term borrowings     The fair value of FHLB advances with remaining maturities of one year or less is estimated by discounting the obligations using the rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. The fair value of the repurchase obligation is considered to be equal to the carrying value because of its short-term nature. The fair value of secured borrowings and other borrowings is equal to the value of the loans they are collateralizing. See    Loans    above for further information. The carrying amount of the obligation for cash collateral held is considered to be its fair value because of its short-term nature. 
    
  Long-term debt     The fair value of the Company s fixed-rate long-term debt was estimated using the unadjusted publicly-available market price as of period end.  
    
  FHLB advances with remaining maturities greater than one year and the Company s variable-rate junior subordinated debentures are estimated by discounting future cash flows. For the FHLB advances with remaining maturities greater than one year, the Company discounts cash flows using quoted interest rates for similar financial instruments. For the Company s variable-rate junior subordinated debentures, we interpolate a discount rate we believe is appropriate based on quoted interest rates and entity specific adjustments. 
    
  Commitments     Given the limited interest rate risk posed by the commitments outstanding at period end due to their variable rate structure, termination clauses provided in the agreements, and the market rate of fees charged, we have deemed the fair value of commitments outstanding to be immaterial.

18.   OPERATING SEGMENTS 
    
  We have three primary operating segments: Banking, Asset Management and the Holding Company. With respect to the Banking and Asset Management segments, each is delineated by the products and services that it offers. The Banking operating segment is comprised of commercial and personal banking services, including mortgage originations. Commercial banking services are primarily provided to corporations and other business clients and include a wide array of lending and cash management products. Personal banking services offered to individuals, professionals, and entrepreneurs include direct lending and depository services. The Asset Management segment includes certain activities of our PrivateWealth group, including investment management, personal trust and estate administration, custodial and escrow, retirement plans and brokerage services. The activities of the third operating segment, the Holding Company, include the direct and indirect ownership of our banking subsidiary, the issuance of debt and intersegment eliminations. 
    
  The accounting policies of the individual operating segments are the same as those of the Company as described in   Note 1  . Transactions between operating segments are primarily conducted at fair value, resulting in profits that are eliminated from consolidated results of operations.

19.   VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
    
  The Company is required to consolidate VIEs in which it has a controlling financial interest. The following table summarizes the carrying amounts of the consolidated VIEs  assets included in the Company s statements of financial condition as adjusted for intercompany eliminations at   September 30, 2016  . At   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have any VIEs that were consolidated in our financial statements. 
    
  Consolidated VIEs 
  (Amounts in thousands) 

The Company sponsors and consolidates certain VIEs that invest in community development projects designed primarily to promote community welfare, such as economic rehabilitation and development of low-income areas by providing housing, services, or jobs for residents. These VIEs invest in community development projects through the extension of below-market loans that generate a return primarily through the realization of federal new markets tax credits. The consolidated VIEs  loans are recognized within loans on the Company s consolidated statements of financial condition. The federal new markets tax credits earned from equity investments in VIEs are recognized as a component of income tax expense, and interest income received on the loans is recognized within interest income on the Company s consolidated statements of income. The assets of the consolidated VIEs are the primary source of funds to settle their respective obligations. The creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The Company s exposure to each consolidated VIE is limited to the amount of equity invested by the Company in the VIE. 
   The table below presents our interests in VIEs that are not consolidated in our financial statements at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .

  Trust preferred capital securities issuances     As discussed in   Note 10  , we sponsor and wholly own   100%   of the common equity of   four   trusts that were formed for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds therefrom in debentures issued by the Company. The trusts  only assets are the debentures and the related interest receivable, which are included within long-term debt in our consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts and, accordingly, the trusts are not consolidated in our financial statements.

CRA investments and loans     We hold certain investments and loans that make investments to further our CRA initiatives. CRA investments are included within other assets and CRA loans are included within loans in our consolidated statements of financial condition. Certain of these investments and loans meet the definition of a VIE, but the Company is not the primary beneficiary as we are a limited investor and do not have the power to direct their investment activities. Accordingly, we will continue to account for our interests in these investments and loans on an unconsolidated basis. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount plus additional required future capital contributions. 
    
  A portion of our CRA investments are investments in limited liability entities that invest in affordable housing projects that qualify for low-income housing tax credits. These investments entitle the Company to tax credits through   2028  . Any new investments in qualified affordable housing projects entered into on or after January 1, 2014, that meet certain conditions are accounted for using the proportional amortization method. Prior to January 1, 2014, the Company accounted for all of its investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the effective yield method and has elected to continue accounting for preexisting tax credit investments using the effective yield method as permitted under the accounting standards. 
    
  The carrying value of the Company s tax credit investments in affordable housing projects totaled   $35.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $27.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Commitments to provide future capital contributions totaling   $29.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , are expected to be paid through   2031  . These investments are reviewed periodically for impairment.   No   impairment losses were recorded for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . The following table summarizes the impact on the consolidated statement of income for the periods presented.

Restructured loans     For certain troubled commercial loans, we restructure the terms of the borrower s debt in an effort to increase the probability of collecting amounts contractually due. Following a restructuring, the borrower entity typically meets the definition of a VIE, and economic events have proven that the entity s equity is not sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or a restructuring of the terms of its financing. As we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such troubled commercial borrowers  operations, we are not considered the primary beneficiary even in situations where, based on the size of the financing provided, we are exposed to potentially significant benefits and losses of the borrowing entity. We have no contractual requirements to provide financial support to the borrowing entities beyond certain funding commitments established upon restructuring of the terms of the debt. Our interests in the troubled commercial borrowers include outstanding loans and related derivative assets. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to these interests plus any additional future funding commitments. 
    
  Warrants     In connection with certain negotiated credit facilities, we receive warrants to acquire stock in privately-held client companies. We have no contractual requirement to provide financial support to the borrowing entities beyond the funding commitments established at origination of the credit facilities. As we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the client companies  operations, we are not considered the primary beneficiary of these companies.

  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  Statements contained in this report that are not historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements represent management s current beliefs and expectations regarding future events, such as our anticipated future financial results, credit quality, liquidity, revenues, expenses, or other financial items, and the impact of business plans and strategies or legislative or regulatory actions. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as  may,   might,   will,   should,   could,   would,   expect,   plan,   anticipate,   intend,   believe,   estimate,   predict,   project,   potential,  or  continue  or other comparable terminology. 
    
  Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of future plans, strategies or events is inherently uncertain. Factors which could cause actual results or conditions to differ from those reflected in forward-looking statements include: 

the possibility that the transaction with CIBC does not close when expected or at all because required regulatory, stockholder or other approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; or the possibility that, as a result of the announcement and pendency of the proposed transaction, we experience difficulties in employee retention and/or clients or vendors seek to change their existing business relationships with us, or competitors change their strategies to compete against us, any of which may have a negative impact on our business or operations; 
                
    uncertainty regarding geopolitical developments and the U.S. and global economic outlook that may continue to impact market conditions or affect demand for certain banking products and services;  
                
    unanticipated developments in pending or prospective loan transactions or greater-than-expected paydowns or payoffs of existing loans; 
                
    competitive pressures in the financial services industry relating to both pricing and loan structures, which may impact our growth rate; 
                
    unforeseen credit quality problems or changing economic conditions that could result in charge-offs greater than we have anticipated in our allowance for loan losses or changes in value of our investments; 
                
    unanticipated changes in monetary policies of the Federal Reserve or significant adjustments in the pace of, or market expectations for, future interest rate changes; 
                
    availability of sufficient and cost-effective sources of liquidity or funding as and when needed; 
                
    unanticipated losses of one or more large depositor relationships, or other significant deposit outflows; 
                
    loss of key personnel or an inability to recruit appropriate talent cost-effectively; 
                
    greater-than-anticipated costs to support the growth of our business, including investments in technology, process improvements or other infrastructure enhancements, or greater-than-anticipated compliance or regulatory costs and burdens; or 
                
    failures or disruptions to, or compromises of, our data processing or other information or operational systems, including the potential impact of disruptions or security breaches at our third-party service providers. 
       
  These factors should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on our forward-looking statements. Readers should also consider the risks, assumptions and uncertainties set forth in the  Risk Factors  section of our   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , and this  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  section of this Form 10-Q, as well as those set forth in our subsequent periodic and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
    
  On June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC ), a Canadian chartered bank, and CIBC Holdco Inc. ( Holdco ), a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC, pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving the merger. Following the merger, the Bank will be headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, retain its Illinois state banking charter and be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter 2017, pending regulatory and stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions. The Company s special meeting of stockholders is scheduled for December 8, 2016. 

OVERVIEW OF RECENT FINANCIAL RESULTS 
    
  For the   third quarter 2016  , we reported net income available to common stockholders of   $48.9 million  ,   increasing     $3.6 million  , or   8%  , from   third quarter 2015  . Compared to   second quarter 2016  , net income available to common stockholders   declined     $1.5 million  , or   3%  , from   second quarter 2016  . Diluted earnings per share were   $0.60  ,   an increase   of   5%   compared to   $0.57   per diluted share in   third quarter 2015  . For the   third quarter 2016  , our annualized return on average assets was   1.04%   and our annualized return on average common equity was   10.40%  , compared with   1.09%   and   11.05%  , respectively, in the year ago quarter. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we reported net income available to common stockholders of   $148.8 million  ,   increasing     $15.6 million  , or   12%  , from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Diluted earnings per share were   $1.84   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   10%   compared to   $1.67   per diluted share for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Results for the current year-to-date included   $6.4 million   of costs related to the pending CIBC transaction, which reduce earnings per share by $0.05 on an after-tax basis. Annualized return on average assets was   1.11%   and our annualized return on average common equity was   10.99%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared with prior year ratios of 1.10% and 11.31%, respectively. 
    
  Net interest income for   third quarter 2016     increased     $14.3 million   compared to   third quarter 2015  , reflecting higher interest income from   $2.0 billion   of   growth   in average interest-earning assets and the impact from a rise in short-term rates. Net interest margin was   3.18%   for   third quarter 2016  ,   declining   five basis points from   third quarter 2015  , primarily related to higher funding costs while yields on interest-earning assets remained stable on a comparative basis. 
    
  Non-interest income for   third quarter 2016     increased     $6.8 million   from the prior year quarter with all major fee categories, excluding loan, letter of credit and commitment fees, contributing to the current quarter increase. As a result of the growth in net interest income and non-interest income, net revenue   increased     $21.2 million  , or   13%  , to   $184.3 million  , from   $163.1 million   for   third quarter 2015  . Non-interest expense   increased     8%   from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits expense and technology costs. 
    
  Growth in earning assets continued to benefit operating profit, which increased   $14.5 million   from   $78.0 million   for   third quarter 2015   to   $92.4 million   for   third quarter 2016  . The efficiency ratio was   49.9%   for   third quarter 2016  , compared to   52.2%   for   third quarter 2015  . 
    
  Total loans   grew     $1.4 billion  , or   10%  , from   year end 2015   to   $14.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and increased   $1.6 billion  , or   12%  , from   September 30, 2015  , driven primarily by growth in commercial and industrial loans. Total commercial loans and commercial real estate ( CRE ) loans comprised   65%   and   26%   of total loans, respectively, at   September 30, 2016  , largely comparable with   year end 2015   and   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The provision for loan losses, excluding covered assets, increased to   $15.9 million   in   third quarter 2016   from   $4.2 million   for   third quarter 2015  . While asset quality remained strong, the provision was higher following several quarters of historically low credit costs. The increase in the general reserve reflected strong loan growth and some credit migration. At   September 30, 2016  , nonperforming loans increased to   $87.4 million  , compared to   $53.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Higher nonperforming loan levels at   September 30, 2016   included inflows from two related loan relationships totaling $21.8 million. Nonperforming assets to total assets were   0.52%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.35%   at   December 31, 2015  . Nonperforming loans to total loans were   0.60%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.41%   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was   1.23%  , compared to   1.21%   at   December 31, 2015  . Net charge-offs totaled   $4.2 million   in   third quarter 2016  , elevated compared to net recoveries of   $1.6 million   in   third quarter 2015  , largely related to a single relationship that was identified during the current quarter.

Total deposits of   $15.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  ,   increased     $1.1 billion  , or   8%  , from   year end 2015  , and increased   $1.6 billion  , or   11%   from   September 30, 2015  . Noninterest-bearing deposits grew   $501.8 million   from   December 31, 2015   and   $788.7 million   from a year ago. Our deposit base is predominately comprised of commercial client balances, which will fluctuate from time to time based on our clients  business and liquidity needs. Deposit funding was supplemented by an increase in traditional brokered deposits and short-term borrowings from year end 2015. The loan-to-deposit ratio was   95%   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   92%   at   December 31, 2015  .

Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income is the primary source of the Company s revenue. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is affected by (1) the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; (2) the volume and value of noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity; (3) the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk; (4) the sensitivity of the balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities, and repricing frequencies; (5) loan repayment behavior, which affects timing of recognition of certain loan fees as well as penalties; and (6) asset quality. 
    
  Interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. Net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and equity, also support interest-earning assets. 
    
  The accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets are included in   Note 1   of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  contained in our   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  . 
    
  For purposes of this discussion, net interest income and any ratios or metrics that include net interest income as a component, such as net interest margin, have been adjusted to a fully tax-equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax-exempt securities to those on taxable securities, assuming a federal income tax rate of   35%  . The effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment is presented at the bottom of the following table. 
    
  Table 2   and   Table 3   summarize the changes in our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as well as the average interest rates earned and paid on these assets and liabilities, respectively, for the quarters and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Table 2 also presents the trend in net interest margin on a quarterly basis for   2016   and   2015  , including the tax-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In addition,   Table 2   and   Table 3   detail variances in income and expense for each of the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and indicate the extent to which such variances are attributable to volume versus yield/rate changes.

    Interest income and yields are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a federal income tax rate of   35%  . This is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Refer to   Table 24  ,    Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures  ,  for a reconciliation of the effect of the tax-equivalent adjustment. 
                (5)   
    Covered interest-earning assets consist of loans acquired through a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) assisted transaction that are subject to a loss share agreement and the related indemnification asset. Refer to the section below entitled  Covered Assets  for a detailed discussion. 
       
  Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis   increased   by   $14.4 million  , or   11%  , to   $146.7 million   for   third quarter 2016  , compared to   $132.3 million   for   third quarter 2015  . Interest income   increase  d by   $18.8 million   from the prior year quarter, largely driven by average loan growth, which contributed   $15.1 million   to interest income on a comparative basis. Securities interest income increased $1.9 million from third quarter 2015, primarily due to growth in the portfolio, while security yields continued to compress in the low rate environment. Interest expense   increased   by   $4.5 million  , largely related to   $3.4 million   in higher deposit costs, reflecting deposits indexed to a higher Fed funds effective rate and higher rates paid on certain money market accounts. Interest expense on short-term borrowings increased by $1.0 million from the third quarter 2015, primarily reflecting higher average overnight FHLB advances as compared to the prior year quarter. 
    
  Average interest-earning assets growth of   $2.0 billion   from the prior year period was primarily driven by higher average loan balances of   $1.5 billion  , with   $644.5 million   of the growth related to the commercial loan portfolio and   $562.8 million   of the   growth   related to the CRE portfolio. In addition, average securities balances   increase  d by   $521.9 million   from third quarter 2015. Average interest-bearing liabilities   grew     $1.1 billion   from the prior year period, reflecting growth in average deposits, which increased $564.2 million compared to third quarter 2015, as well as an increased use of short-term FHLB advances and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements during the current quarter.  
    
  Net interest margin was   3.18%   for   third quarter 2016  , declining five basis points from the   third quarter 2015  . Yields on interest-earning assets remained stable compared to the prior year. Overall loan yields increased by four basis points from the   third quarter 2015  , as improvements related to higher short-term rates on our largely variable rate portfolio were partially offset by continued pricing reductions resulting from the competitive environment and a lower contribution from loan fees and hedging. Our overall loan yields continue to be aided by our hedging program, although at a reduced level as compared to the   third quarter 2015   due to higher short-term rates and a decline in the notional value of the active hedge program. Compared to the   third quarter 2015  , loan fees declined $1.8 million, or seven basis points, reflecting a $1.2 million prepayment fee included in prior quarter results and lower-than-average loan payoffs during the third quarter 2016, which generally trigger the acceleration of unamortized loan fees. Excluding the impact from loan fees, hedging, and movement in LIBOR, loan yields have continued to compress in the current environment. The yield on our securities portfolio decreased 14 basis points from the prior year comparative period, reflecting accelerated prepayment speeds and reduced yields on securities purchased in the low rate environment.  
    
  Our cost of funds for   third quarter 2016   increased by nine basis points from   third quarter 2015  , driven primarily by higher rates paid on deposits. Deposit costs increased by ten basis points from the prior year period, reflecting the repricing of deposits tied to a higher Fed funds effective rate following the mid-December 2015 rate increase, as well as higher rates paid on certain money  
  
   59 

     Table of Contents  

market accounts. Deposits tied to the Fed funds effective rate totaled $1.6 billion at   September 30, 2016  . Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits and average equity, our principal sources of noninterest-bearing funds, increased in aggregate by $922.4 million from the comparative period, adding four basis points of value to net interest margin due to higher volume and the increased value of noninterest-bearing liabilities in a higher rate environment. 
    
  In the prolonged low interest rate environment, competition remains strong, which has influenced loan pricing and structure. As a result, we have experienced a general decline in our loan yields due to pricing compression on new loans, including within certain of our specialty businesses, and, to a lesser extent, on loan renewals in the current environment. Future loan yields may be impacted by fluctuations in loan fees driven by acceleration of unamortized origination fees upon early payoff or refinancing, and prepayment and other fees received on certain event-driven actions in accordance with the loan agreement, as well as interest income recognized upon recovery of interest on nonaccrual loans. To the extent short-term interest rates continue to rise, the impact on deposit costs for our indexed deposits has greater predictability than our non-indexed deposits. Deposit costs will depend on various factors including client behavior, pricing pressure within the bank marketplace and from non-bank alternatives, the mix of our funding sources, and prices for alternative sources of deposits and funds.

    Includes loans held-for-sale and nonaccrual loans. Average loans on a nonaccrual basis for the recognition of interest income totaled   $66.5 million   and   $60.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest foregone on impaired loans was estimated to be approximately   $2.1 million   and   $1.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, calculated based on the average loan portfolio yield for the respective period.

  As shown in   Table 3  , net interest margin was   3.25%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   3.20%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Tax-equivalent net interest income   increased     $49.7 million   to   $430.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $380.9 million   for the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in net interest income reflected the   $1.8 billion   of   growth   in average loans and securities, as well as the impact from the mid-December 2015 rate rise, which lifted yields on our largely variable rate loan portfolio and deposit costs tied to the Fed funds effective rate. 

Non-interest Income 
    
  Non-interest income is derived from a number of sources including fees from our various commercial products and services such as the sale of derivative products through our capital markets group, treasury management services, lending and servicing and syndication activities, our asset management business, our mortgage banking business and deposit services to our retail clients.  
    
  The following table presents a break-out of these multiple sources of revenue for the periods presented.

  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three month ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Non-interest income for   third quarter 2016   totaled   $37.6 million  , compared to   $30.8 million   for   third quarter 2015  , with increases in all core fee income categories except for loan, letter of credit and commitment fees. Certain income sources, such as mortgage banking, capital markets products and syndication fees, are transactional in nature and are significantly impacted by market forces (e.g., interest rates have a significant impact on mortgage banking volume) and, accordingly, tend to fluctuate and generate uneven income from period to period.

Assets under management and administration ( AUMA ) are impacted by the general performance in equity and fixed income markets. The pricing on asset management accounts varies depending on the type of services provided. Custody and escrow services involve safeguarding and administering client assets but do not involve providing investment management services. These assets are considered to be  non-managed  AUMA and have a significantly lower fee structure than  managed  AUMA. Managed AUMA are assets for which we provide investment management services and fees from these assets are generally based on the market value of the assets on the last day of the prior quarter or month, which subject these fees to market volatility. 
    
  For   third quarter 2016  , asset management fee income increased by   $1.1 million  , or   25%  , compared to   third quarter 2015  , with the increase primarily attributable to the addition of a single $2.4 billion corporate trust account (shown below in custody assets) in first quarter 2016, growth in personal managed assets, and, to a lesser extent, price adjustments on certain managed asset accounts. The funds in the large corporate trust account have been gradually disbursed or redeployed during second and third quarter, and we expect this to continue over the next several quarters, with the account fully disbursed or redeployed by the end of 2017. Accordingly, the contribution to our asset management fee income from this account each quarter is declining and is expected to continue declining. Aggregate AUMA at   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $2.9 billion   from   September 30, 2015   and   $2.8 billion   from December 31, 2015, largely attributable to the previously mentioned sizeable corporate trust account, a $1.0 billion single corporate retirement account added during second quarter 2016, and growth in personal managed assets. 
    
  The following table presents the composition of AUMA as of the dates shown. 

(1)   
    September 30, 2016   includes a $1.5 billion corporate trust account for which we do not provide investment management services, but do serve as trustee. 
       
  Income from our mortgage banking business, which includes gains on loans sold and certain mortgage related loan fees,   grew     $1.7 million  , or   51%  , to   $5.1 million   in   third quarter 2016   compared to   $3.3 million   for   third quarter 2015   due to a higher volume of loans sold during the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter, as well as improved spreads. We sold $145.2 million of mortgage loans in the secondary market, generating gains of $5.1 million in   third quarter 2016  , compared to $105.3 million of mortgage loans sold, generating gains of $3.3 million, in the prior year quarter. During   third quarter 2016  , both refinance activity and new home purchases exceeded levels in   third quarter 2015  .  
    
  The following table presents the composition of capital markets income for the past five quarters. 

Capital markets income was   $5.4 million   in   third quarter 2016  ,   increasing     $2.4 million   from   third quarter 2015  , largely attributable to movement in the CVA. The CVA represents the credit component of fair value with regard to both client-based derivatives and the related matched derivatives with interbank dealer counterparties. Exclusive of CVA, capital markets products income   increased     $213,000  , or   5%  , from   third quarter 2015  , reflecting higher average deal sizes, longer maturities, and higher spreads for interest rate contracts, offset by somewhat lower revenue in foreign exchange ( FX ) transactions. FX transactions generally provide a more stable source of fee income compared to the transactional nature of interest rate contracts, which are significantly influenced

     Table of Contents  

by clients  views on the extent and timing of future interest rate movements. As shown in the table above, over the past five quarters, fees from interest rate contracts have fluctuated period to period due to both volume and size of transactions. 
    
  Treasury management income   increase  d   $607,000  , or   8%  , from   third quarter 2015   due to higher volume across our treasury management platforms. The current quarter   increase   reflects the ongoing success in cross-selling our treasury management services to new commercial clients as we continue to build client relationships, with approximately 76% of our commercial clients using treasury management services at   September 30, 2016  , as well as some price adjustments on certain services. Cross-sell and implementation of treasury management services may lag the closing of a credit facility by three to six months on average. 
    
  Loan, letter of credit, and commitment fees   declined     $377,000  , or   7%  , from   third quarter 2015  , driven by lower standby letter of credit fees, partially offset by higher unused commitment fees. The majority of our unused commitment fees related to revolving facilities, which at   September 30, 2016   totaled $10.7 billion, of which $5.7 billion were unused. In comparison, at   September 30, 2015  , commitments related to revolving facilities totaled $9.5 billion, of which $5.0 billion were unused. 
    
  Syndication fees of   $4.7 million   in   third quarter 2016   were up   $357,000  , or   8%  , from   third quarter 2015  . During   third quarter 2016  , we were the lead or co-lead in 24 syndicated loan transactions, totaling $593.4 million in commitments, of which we retained $272.2 million in commitments. In the prior year period, we were the lead or co-lead in 26 syndicated loan transactions, totaling $725.0 million in commitments, while retaining $292.4 million in commitments. Syndication fees per transaction typically vary depending on, among other factors, market conditions and the size and structure of the transaction, so the aggregate level of syndication fees earned by us in a given period is not entirely correlated with our volume of syndications and our syndication fees can be expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. While we generally expect increased syndication opportunities as we grow our loan portfolio and client relationships, our volume of syndication transactions depends on a number of factors, including portfolio management decisions, the mix of loans originated, and liquidity and demand by other institutions for syndicated loans. We believe that a number of macroeconomic conditions, such as declining commodity prices and uncertainty about economic growth, and regulatory developments, such as enhanced regulatory focus on leveraged lending and CRE concentrations, have impacted market demand for syndicated loans, which could reduce our level of syndication fees in future periods. 
    
  Deposit service charges and fees and other income increased   $1.3 million   from   third quarter 2015  , largely attributable to a gain on the sale of a problem loan. 
    
  Nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Non-interest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $108.3 million  ,   increasing     $11.0 million  , or   11%  , compared to   $97.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . We experienced increases in all categories of non-interest income, except for deposit service charges and fees and other income during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Other income for the first   nine months   of   2015   included a $4.1 million gain on the sale of our Georgia branch that was completed during first quarter 2015.  
    
  Asset management fee income   increased     17%   to   $15.9 million   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the previous year period. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of a single $2.4 billion corporate trust account in first quarter 2016, growth in personal managed assets of   12  % from September 30, 2015, and, to a lesser extent, price adjustments on certain managed asset accounts. 
    
  Income from our mortgage banking business   increased     12%   to   $12.6 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016  , compared to   $11.3 million   in the previous year period. The increase resulted from higher spreads on loans sold as volumes were comparable to the year ago period and higher level of origination fees. We sold $377.9 million of mortgage loans in the secondary market, generating gains of $12.6 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to $378.3 million of mortgage loans sold, generating gains of $11.3 million, for the prior year period. 
    
  Capital markets income increased   $4.3 million   from the prior year period to   $16.5 million   for the current   nine months  . The current   nine months   included a   negative   CVA of   $2.0 million   compared to a   negative   CVA of   $1.4 million   in   2015  . Exclusive of CVA adjustments, year-over-year capital markets income was   $18.5 million   in the current period compared to   $13.6 million   in the prior year period, an increase of   $4.9 million  , or   36%  . The increase in income is due to higher average deal sizes, longer maturities, and higher spreads for interest rate contracts, offset by somewhat lower revenue in FX transactions as a result of tighter spreads. 
    
  Treasury management income   increased     $2.3 million  , or   10%  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase reflected ongoing success in cross-selling treasury management services to our commercial clients.

     Table of Contents  

Loan, letter of credit, and commitment fees increased   $341,000  , or   2%  , from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily related to higher levels of unused commitment fees and loan fees, somewhat offset by lower standby letter of credit fees compared to the prior year period. 
    
  Syndication fees   increased     $3.5 million  , or   28%  , from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The first nine months of 2016 included a single transaction which contributed $1.9 million of revenue. In the current year-to-date period, we have experienced higher volume from ongoing opportunities as we grow our loan portfolio and client relationships compared to the prior year comparative period.

  Non-interest expense   increased   by   $6.7 million  , or   8%  , compared to   third quarter 2015  . Higher compensation expense largely contributed to the current quarter increase compared to the prior year period. 
    
  Compensation expense, which is comprised of salary and wages, share-based costs, incentive compensation and payroll taxes, insurance and retirement costs,   increased     $5.9 million  , or   12%  , from   third quarter 2015  . Salary and wages were   up     $2.8 million  , or   10%  , primarily due to a larger employee base compared to levels at   September 30, 2015  , as well as annual compensation and promotion adjustments. Incentive compensation increased by   $2.3 million  , or   17%  , compared to the prior year period, reflecting improved performance resulting in higher incentive compensation plan expense and mortgage banking commissions. Payroll taxes, insurance and retirement costs were   up     $575,000  , reflecting higher medical insurance expense as a result of a higher level of claims during the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 
    
  Marketing expense   increased     $905,000  , or   25%  , reflecting higher costs associated with sponsorships and contributions on a comparative basis, which were somewhat offset by lower advertising costs as a result of the timing of various advertising campaigns compared to the prior year period. 
    
  Professional services expense, which includes fees paid for legal services in connection with corporate activities, accounting, and consulting services,   declined     $814,000  , or   22%  , from   third quarter 2015  , primarily due to lower consulting services costs in the current quarter, as the prior year quarter included additional consulting services related to investments in operational and technology enhancements. 
    
  Loan and collection expense, which consists of certain non-reimbursable costs associated with loan origination and servicing, as well as loan remediation costs for problem and nonperforming loans,   declined     $352,000   from   third quarter 2015  , as the prior year quarter included higher loan remediation costs related to a single problem loan resolution. 
    
  Our efficiency ratio was   49.9%   for   third quarter 2016  , compared to   52.2%   for   third quarter 2015  . Further meaningful improvement in the efficiency ratio will likely depend on a rise in short-term interest rates, which we expect would cause an increase in our net interest income without a corresponding increase to our non-interest expenses. 
    
  Nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Non-interest expense   increase  d   $26.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior year period, primarily related to increases in compensation and professional services expense. Included in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $6.4 million   of transaction-related expenses associated with the proposed transaction with CIBC that were largely reflected in professional services expense. 
    
  Compensation expense   increased   overall by   $17.2 million  , or   11%  , from the prior year period due to additional staff, annual compensation adjustments and increased incentive compensation accruals. Salary and wages were up   $7.6 million  , or   9%  , primarily due to a higher FTE base, as well as annual compensation adjustments. Share-based costs   increased     $1.7 million  , or   12%  , attributable to a higher volume of awards granted during first quarter 2016 that met a shortened expense recognition period related to certain retirement provisions and a higher level of annual awards granted. Incentive compensation and commissions increased   $7.3 million  , or   20%  , from the prior period reflecting improved performance resulting in higher incentive compensation and commissions on a higher FTE basis. 
    
  Professional services expense, which includes fees paid for legal services in connection with corporate activities, accounting, and consulting services,   increased     $6.8 million   from the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as second quarter 2016 results included   $6.4 million   of transaction-related costs. 
    
  Net foreclosed property expenses   decline  d   $1.1 million  , or   37%  , compared to the prior year period. The   decline   in net foreclosed property expenses primarily related to an $882,000 in reduction in OREO valuation write-downs compared to the prior year period. 
    
  Insurance costs   increased     $1.4 million  , or   14%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period. Higher insurance costs primarily related to larger FDIC deposit insurance premiums in 2016, reflecting overall asset growth and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the rate paid due to changes to the overall composition of our balance sheet. 
    
  Loan and collection expense   decreased     $1.3 million  , or   19%  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year period, which included higher loan remediation costs related to problem loan resolution on two specific credits.

Other operating expenses   declined     $1.0 million  , or   7  %, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Lower other operating expenses was largely due to a decline in various miscellaneous other expenses, including a $2.3 million decrease in CRA investments expense, which was somewhat offset by an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments of $957,000 compared to the prior year period. 

Income Taxes 
    
  Our provision for income taxes includes federal, state and local income tax expense. For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded an income tax provision of   $26.6 million   on pre-tax income of   $75.5 million   (equal to a   35.3%   effective tax rate) compared to an income tax provision of   $27.4 million   on pre-tax income of   $72.6 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   (equal to a   37.7%   effective tax rate). 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , income tax expense totaled   $82.3 million   on pre-tax income of   $231.1 million   (equal to a   35.6%   effective tax rate) compared to an income tax provision of   $79.8 million   on pre-tax income of   $213.0 million   (equal to a   37.5%   effective tax rate) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The lower tax rate in 2016 is attributable to tax benefits from the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the accounting for income taxes associated with share-based compensation and additional new market tax credits. 
    
  Net deferred tax assets totaled   $103.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . We have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and, accordingly, no valuation allowance was recorded during the quarter. This conclusion was based in part on the fact that the Company had cumulative book income for financial statement purposes at   September 30, 2016  , measured on a trailing three-year basis. In addition, we considered the Company s recent earnings history, on both a book and tax basis, and our outlook for earnings and taxable income in future periods. 

Operating Segments Results 
    
  We have three primary operating segments: Banking, Asset Management, and Holding Company Activities. 
    
  Banking 
    
  The Banking operating segment is comprised of commercial and personal banking services. Commercial banking services are primarily provided to corporations and other business clients and include a wide array of lending and cash management products. Personal banking services offered to individuals, professionals, and entrepreneurs include direct lending and depository services. 
    
  Our Banking segment is the Company s most significant segment, representing   89%   of consolidated total assets and generating nearly all of our net income. The profitability of our Banking segment is dependent on net interest income, provision for loan and covered loan losses, non-interest income (exclusive of asset management fees), and non-interest expense (exclusive of such expenses attributable to our asset management business). The net income for the Banking segment for   third quarter 2016   was   $52.8 million  , an   increase   of   $3.0 million   from net income of   $49.8 million   for the prior year period. The   increase   in net income for the Banking segment was primarily due to a   $14.4 million     increase   in net interest income resulting from $1.4 billion, or 11%, in average   loan growth   since the prior year period coupled with higher short-term rates. The provision for loan losses was up   $11.5 million   from the third quarter 2015, reflecting loan growth and some credit migration. Non-interest expense for the Banking segment increased by   $6.5 million   from the prior year period, largely due to higher salaries and benefits expense, driven by an increase in staffing, annual salary and promotional adjustments, as well as higher performance-based incentive compensation costs. 
    
  Total loans for the Banking segment increased   $1.4 billion   to   $14.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $13.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Total deposits were   $15.5 billion   and   $14.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Asset Management 
    
  The Asset Management segment includes certain activities of our Private Wealth group, including investment management, personal trust and estate administration, custodial and escrow services, retirement account administration, and brokerage services. The private banking activities of our Private Wealth group are included with the Banking segment. 
    
  Net income from Asset Management   increased   to   $1.3 million   for   third quarter 2016   from   $942,000   for the prior year period, reflecting the benefit of adding a new $2.4 billion corporate trust account during first quarter 2016, growth in personal managed assets, and, to a lesser extent, price adjustments on certain managed asset accounts. AUMA totaled   $10.0 billion   at   September 30,  
  
   68 

     Table of Contents  

2016  , compared to   $7.2 billion   at   September 30, 2015  , primarily reflecting the sizeable corporate trust addition noted above, $1.0 billion added from a single corporate retirement account, and growth in personal managed assets. 
    
  Holding Company Activities 
    
  The Holding Company Activities segment consists of parent company-only activity and intersegment eliminations. The Holding Company s most significant asset is its investment in the Bank. Undistributed earnings relating to this investment is not included in the Holding Company financial results. Holding Company financial results are represented primarily by interest expense on borrowings and operating expenses. Recurring operating expenses consist primarily of compensation expense allocated to the Holding Company and professional fees. For the   third quarter 2016  , the net loss for the Holding Company Activities segment was   $5.2 million  , compared to a   net loss   of   $5.4 million   for the   third quarter 2015  . The Holding Company had   $50.4 million   in cash at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $61.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Additional information about our operating segments are also discussed in   Note 18   of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in   Item 1   of this   Form 10-Q  . 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  Total assets were   $19.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an   11%     increase   in total assets from   $17.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Total loans were   $14.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $13.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Our total deposits   increased   to   $15.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   from   $14.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Total stockholders  equity   increased     11%   from   $1.7 billion   at   December 31, 2015   to   $1.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Investment Portfolio Management  
    
  We manage our investment securities portfolio to maximize the return on invested funds within acceptable risk guidelines, meet pledging and liquidity requirements, and adjust balance sheet interest rate sensitivity in an effort to protect net interest income levels against the impact of changes in interest rates. Investments in the portfolio are comprised of debt securities, primarily residential mortgage-backed securities and, to a lesser extent, state and municipal securities. 
    
  We may adjust the size and composition of our securities portfolio according to a number of factors, including expected liquidity needs, the current and forecasted interest rate environment, our actual and anticipated balance sheet growth rate, the relative value of various segments of the securities markets, and the broader economic and regulatory environment. 
    
  Debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of our asset/liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities represent the difference between the aggregate cost and fair value of the portfolio and are reported, on an after-tax basis, as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ). This balance sheet component will fluctuate as market interest rates and conditions change, with such changes affecting the aggregate fair value of the portfolio. In periods of significant market volatility, we may experience significant changes in AOCI.  
    
  Debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity are securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold them until maturity and are accounted for using historical cost, as adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.

  Investment Securities Portfolio Valuation Summary 
  (Dollars in thousands) 

As of   September 30, 2016  , our securities portfolio totaled   $3.6 billion  ,   increasing     16%   compared to   December 31, 2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , purchases of securities totaled   $825.6 million  , with   $385.0 million   in the available-for-sale portfolio and   $440.6 million   in the held-to-maturity portfolio. The current year purchases in the investment portfolio primarily represented the reinvestment of proceeds from sales, maturities and paydowns in largely similar agency guaranteed residential mortgage-backed securities and state and municipal securities as well as purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, state and municipal securities and agency guaranteed residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. 
    
  In conjunction with ongoing portfolio management and rebalancing activities, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we sold   $45.4 million   in state and municipal securities, resulting in a   net securities gain   of   $1.1 million  . 
    
  Investments in collateralized mortgage obligations and residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities comprised   72%   of the total portfolio at   September 30, 2016  . All of the mortgage-backed securities are backed by U.S. Government agencies or issued by U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. All residential mortgage-backed securities are composed of fixed-rate, fully-amortizing collateral with final maturities of 30 years or less. 
    
  Investments in debt instruments of state and local municipalities comprised   13%   of the total portfolio at   September 30, 2016  . This type of security has historically experienced very low default rates and provided a predictable cash flow because it generally is not subject to significant prepayment. For a portion of our state and local municipality debt instruments, insurance companies and state programs provide credit enhancement to improve the credit rating and liquidity of the issuance. Management considers underlying municipality credit strength and any credit enhancement when evaluating a purchase or sale decision. 
    
  We do not hold direct exposure to the obligations of the State of Illinois. We hold some bonds from municipalities in Illinois, but the finances of these municipalities are not primarily dependent on the finances of the State of Illinois.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our reported equity reflected   unrealized net securities gains   on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, of   $26.7 million  ,   an increase   of   $12.7 million   from   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to decreases in interest rates and the corresponding increase in the value of the securities. We continue to add, as needed, to the held-to-maturity portfolio to mitigate the potential future market volatility of adding bonds to the available-for-sale portfolio in a low interest rate environment.

Loan Portfolio and Credit Quality (excluding covered assets) 
    
  The following discussion of our loan portfolio and credit quality excludes covered assets. Covered assets represent assets acquired through an FDIC-assisted transaction that are subject to a loss share agreement and are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

  Loan Portfolio 
  (Dollars in thousands) 

Total loans increased   $1.4 billion   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   to   $14.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $13.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , reflecting growth primarily in commercial and commercial real estate loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, new loans to new clients totaled $1.3 billion, and growth in existing clients, net of paydowns, totaled $1.3 billion. Payoffs were $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our five-quarter trailing average loan growth was approximately $529.5 million at   September 30, 2016  , increasing $141.0 million compared to $388.5 million a year ago. Revolving line usage on the overall loan portfolio decreased slightly to 46% at   September 30, 2016  , from 47% at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Our loan growth was primarily driven by growth in the commercial and CRE loan portfolios, which increased   $873.7 million   and   $478.0 million  , respectively, from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . Within the commercial portfolio, we saw growth in multiple industry segments, with the largest being the finance and insurance segment, which increased   $269.8 million   from year end. We also saw growth across multiple asset classes in the CRE portfolio. Multi-family is the largest asset class in the CRE portfolio, representing 23% of the total CRE portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , compared to 22% at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Heightened competition from both bank and nonbank lenders has affected, and continues to affect, borrowers  expectations regarding both pricing and loan structure, which may impact our growth rate due to increasing availability in the market of financing alternatives offering terms outside our pricing and risk tolerances. Our primary strategy is focused on developing new relationships that generate opportunities to provide comprehensive banking services to our clients and, accordingly, we seek to maintain a disciplined approach when pricing and structuring new credit opportunities.  
  We generally earn higher yields on our commercial and industrial portfolio, particularly related to our specialized lending products, such as healthcare and security alarm financing, compared to other segments of our loan portfolio. We also have greater potential to cross-sell other products and services, such as treasury management services, to our commercial and industrial lending clients. 
    
  In the normal course of our business, we participate in loan transactions that involve a number of banks in an effort to maintain and build client relationships while managing portfolio risk, with a view to cross-selling products and originating loans for the borrowers in the future. Although we often strive to lead or co-lead the arrangement, we also participate in transactions led by other banks when we have a relationship with, or seek to develop a relationship with, the borrower. Loan syndications assist us with decreasing credit exposure linked to individual client relationships or loan concentrations by industry, type or size. Of our   $14.7 billion   in total loans at   September 30, 2016  , we were party to $5.4 billion of loans with other financial institutions, consisting of $2.6 billion in retained balances in syndicated loans that were led or co-led by us and $2.8 billion for which we were a non-lead participant in the syndicated loan. Within this $5.4 billion portfolio, $3.2 billion of loans were shared national credits ( SNCs ), of which we were the lead or co-lead in $1.2 billion and the non-lead participant for $2.0 billion. SNCs are defined as loan commitments of at least $20 million that are shared by three or more regulatory depository institutions. Of the $1.3 billion of new loans to new clients during the first nine months of 2016, approximately $171 million, or 13%, were SNCs. To the extent financing  
  
   73 

     Table of Contents  

opportunities we pursue exceed our risk appetite for larger credit exposures and we are not able to syndicate the loan transactions, our loan growth may be impacted. 
    
  The following table summarizes the composition of our commercial loan portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   based on our most significant industry segments, as classified pursuant to the North American Industrial Classification System standard industry description. These categories are based on the nature of the client s ongoing business activity as opposed to the collateral underlying an individual loan. To the extent that a client s underlying business activity changes, classification differences between periods will arise. 
    
  Table 10 
  Commercial Loan Portfolio Composition by Industry Segment 
  (Dollars in thousands) 

(1)   
    All other consists of numerous smaller balances across a variety of industries with no category greater than 2% of total loans. 
        
  Our manufacturing portfolio, representing   21%   of our commercial lending portfolio and 13% of the total portfolio at   September 30, 2016  , is well diversified among sub-industry and product types. The manufacturing industry classification is a key component of our core business. During the second half of 2015 and into 2016, the U.S. manufacturing sector experienced a significant slowdown, as evidenced by declines or slowing rates of growth in a number of key indicators, due in part to the economic headwinds of lower commodity prices, a strong U.S. dollar, and declining oil and gas prices, with particular stress faced by durable goods manufacturing. This stress could adversely impact our existing portfolio and/or our future loan growth rate. 
    
  Our healthcare portfolio totaled   $1.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , comparable to   December 31, 2015  . We have a specialized niche in the skilled nursing, assisted living, and residential care segment of the healthcare industry. Loan relationships to these providers tend to be larger extensions of credit with borrowers primarily represented by for-profit businesses. At   September 30, 2016  ,   20%   of our commercial loan portfolio and 15% of our total loan portfolio was composed of loans extended primarily to operators in this segment to finance the working capital needs and cost of facilities providing such services. The facilities securing the loans are dependent, in part, on the receipt of payments and reimbursements under government contracts for services provided. Accordingly, our clients and their ability to service this debt may be adversely impacted by the financial health of state or federal payors. In recent years, there have been reductions in the reimbursement rates in certain states and government entities are taking longer to reimburse providers. For example, in the State of Illinois, the Medicaid reimbursement rate was reduced and the budget impasse, which has resulted in the state operating without a budget since June 30, 2015, has contributed to reduced Medicaid payments to healthcare providers. Although our healthcare commercial loan portfolio is well diversified across 27 states, loans to borrowers in the State of Illinois represented our highest geographic concentration of healthcare loans at 22% of the healthcare commercial loan portfolio, or $417.7 million, as of   September 30, 2016  . The challenged financial condition of the State of Illinois has had some adverse effects on the cash flow position of some of our Illinois-based healthcare borrowers. Despite this impact on client cash flows, to date, the healthcare loan portfolio has experienced minimal defaults and losses. We are actively monitoring the Illinois budget situation and its potential impact on our borrowers to manage the risks presented by the state s budget problems and overall challenged financial condition. In addition, across the broader healthcare industry, structural changes to government reimbursements may negatively impact performance for managed care facilities as borrowers adapt to the changes, particularly higher cost operators with thinner margins. 
    
  The third largest segment of our commercial loan portfolio is the finance and insurance portfolio, which increased   $269.8 million   since   December 31, 2015   and now represents   17%   of our commercial lending portfolio at   September 30, 2016   compared to   15%   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in the portfolio was primarily due to an increase in specialty finance loans, which totaled $483.5 million as of   September 30, 2016  , up from $388.2 million at   December 31, 2015  . This type of lending represents loans to nonbank specialty finance lenders that provide various types of financing to their customers, such as consumer financing, auto financing, equipment financing or other types of asset-based lending. The growth in this portfolio is a result of pursuing new opportunities to add specialized industry knowledge amongst our client relationship managers, with an expanded team in 2015 and a greater presence in the market. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , outstanding loans under bridge lines to private equity funds, which provide such funds with liquidity as a bridge to the next capital call from their investors, declined by $43.9 million. The terms of such loans are generally between 90 and 120 days and, given their purpose, these loans generally remain outstanding for a short period of time. Amounts outstanding under these lines generally will fluctuate from quarter to quarter given their transactional nature. At   September 30, 2016  , amounts outstanding under bridge lines totaled $196.1 million compared to $239.9 million at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The following table summarizes our CRE and construction loan portfolios by collateral type at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Table 11 
  Commercial Real Estate and Construction Loan Portfolios by Collateral Type 
  (Dollars in thousands) 

*  Less than 0.1% 
    
  Of the combined CRE and construction portfolios, the three largest categories at   September 30, 2016  , were multi-family, retail and office, which represented 25%, 20% and 18%, respectively. Generally, we are a short-to-intermediate term real estate lender,  
  
   74 

     Table of Contents  

and our CRE and construction portfolio strategies focus on core real estate classes in the markets in which we operate and established sponsors and developers with which we have prior experience, other banking relationships, or the opportunity to offer comprehensive banking relationships. Within the multi-family asset type, we believe we are well diversified across property types (low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise structures), unit types (traditional unit sizes, micro units, etc.), class (luxury class A, mid-point class B, etc.) and location. Additionally, the multi-family asset type is further diversified with a combination of stabilization of prior construction projects, existing property improvements, and stable assets with strong recurring cash flows. Payoffs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included property sales and refinancing into the long-term market. 
    
  Portfolio Risk Management 
    
  In conjunction with our commercial middle market focus, our lending activities sometimes involve larger credit relationships. Due to the larger size of these loans, the unexpected occurrence of an event or development with respect to one or more of these loans that adversely impacts the value of collateral securing the loan, the success of a workout strategy or our ability to return the loan to performing status could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  The following table summarizes our credit relationships with commitments greater than $25 million as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Table 12 
  Client Relationships with Commitments Greater Than $25 Million

As part of the risk-based deposit insurance assessment framework, the FDIC has established a regulatory classification of  higher-risk assets,  which include higher-risk commercial and industrial loans (funded and unfunded), construction and development loans (funded and unfunded), non-traditional mortgages, and higher-risk consumer loans. As part of our overall portfolio risk management, we have developed a plan to manage our level of higher-risk assets relative to our capital position and within our overall risk appetite and generally have focused in recent periods on being selective in originating loans that are classified as higher-risk assets. The following table summarizes our higher-risk assets as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Table 13      (1)   
  Higher-Risk Assets 
  (Amounts in thousands) 

(1)   
    Loan category classification is based on the FDIC s regulatory definitions.  
       
  Higher-risk commercial and industrial loans include a majority of our total leveraged loan portfolio and are primarily underwritten on the recurring earnings of the borrower, where the ratio of debt-to-earnings is elevated compared to other commercial loans that are not characterized as higher-risk. Our higher-risk commercial and industrial loans are spread across multiple industries, generally  
  
   75 

     Table of Contents  

command higher loan yields as a premium for underwriting the additional risk attributable to the leveraged position of the underlying borrower, and typically have lower collateral coverage than similar commercial and industrial loans that are not classified by the FDIC as higher-risk assets. Based on our historical experience, the loss factors and the probability of default for loans underwritten with such characteristics have generally been higher than our commercial and industrial loan portfolio as a whole and we take this into account in establishing our allowance for loan losses. 
    
  Maturity and Interest Rate Sensitivity of Loan Portfolio 
    
  The following table summarizes the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  , by category, as well as the interest rate sensitivity of loans in these categories that have maturities in excess of one year. 
    
  Table 14 
  Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates      (1)   
  (Amounts in thousands) 

(1)   
    Maturities are based on contractual maturity date. Actual timing of repayment may differ from those reflected in the table as clients may choose to pre-pay their outstanding balance prior to the contractual maturity date. 
       
  Of the   $10.0 billion   in loans maturing after one year with a floating interest rate,   $916.9 million   are subject to interest rate floors, of which   $485.9 million  , or   53%  , had such floors in effect at   September 30, 2016  . For further analysis and information related to interest rate sensitivity, see Item 3  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  Delinquent Loans, Special Mention and Potential Problem Loans, Restructured Loans and Nonperforming Assets 
    
  Loans are reported delinquent if the required principal and interest payments have not been received within 30 days of the date such payments are due. Delinquency can be driven by either failure of the borrower to make payments during the term of the loan or failure to make the final payment at maturity. The majority of our loans are not fully amortizing over the term. As a result, a sizeable final repayment is often required at maturity. If a borrower lacks refinancing options or the ability to pay the remaining principal amount, the loan may become delinquent in connection with its maturity. 
    
  Loans considered special mention loans are performing in accordance with the contractual terms, but demonstrate potential weakness that, if left unresolved, may result in deterioration in our credit position and/or the repayment prospects for the credit. Borrowers rated special mention may exhibit adverse operating trends, high leverage, tight liquidity, or other credit concerns. These loans continue to accrue interest. 
    
  Potential problem loans, like special mention loans, are loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms, but for which management has some level of concern (greater than that of special mention loans) about the ability of the borrowers to meet existing repayment terms in future periods. These loans continue to accrue interest, but ultimate collection in full is questionable due to the same conditions that characterize a special mention credit. These credits may also have somewhat increased risk profiles  
  
   76 

     Table of Contents  

as a result of the current net worth and/or paying capacity of the obligor or guarantors or the value of the collateral pledged. These loans generally have a well-defined weakness that may jeopardize collection of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we may sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not resolved. Although potential problem loans require additional attention by management, they may not become nonperforming. 
    
  Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and OREO that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure proceedings and are awaiting disposition. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans, including restructured loans that remain on nonaccrual. We specifically exclude restructured loans that accrue interest from our definition of nonperforming loans. 
    
  All loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or earlier if management deems the collectability of principal or interest to be in question prior to the loans becoming 90 days past due. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily preclude the ultimate collection of principal and/or interest. 
    
  As part of our ongoing risk management practices and in certain circumstances, we may extend or modify the terms of a loan in an attempt to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties. The modification may consist of reducing the interest rate, extending the maturity date, reducing the principal balance, or other action intended to minimize potential losses and maximize our chances of a more successful recovery on a troubled loan. When we make such concessions as part of a modification, we report the loan as a troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) and account for the interest due in accordance with our TDR policy. Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. The TDR is classified as an accruing TDR if the borrower has demonstrated the ability to meet the new terms of the restructured loan as evidenced by a minimum of six months of performance in compliance with the restructured terms or if the borrower s performance prior to the restructuring or other significant events at the time of the restructuring supports returning or maintaining the loan on accrual status. TDRs accrue interest as long as the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and management is reasonably assured as to the collectability of principal and interest; otherwise, the restructured loan will be classified as nonaccrual. Loans classified as accruing TDR typically do not require a specific reserve charge, which is a key component in keeping a loan on accrual status. The TDR classification is removed when the loan is either fully repaid or is re-underwritten at market terms and an evaluation of the loan determines that it does not meet the definition of a TDR under current accounting guidance (i.e., the new terms do not represent a concession, the borrower is no longer experiencing financial difficulty, and the re-underwriting is executed at current market terms for new debt with similar risk). 
    
  A discussion of our accounting policies for  Delinquent Loans, Special Mention and Potential Problem Loans, Restructured Loans and Nonperforming Assets  can be found in   Note 1  ,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  and Note 4,  Loans and Credit Quality  in the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  of our   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  .

The following table provides a comparison of our nonperforming assets, restructured loans accruing interest, special mention, potential problem and past due loans for the past five quarters. 
    
  Table 15 
  Nonperforming Assets and Restructured and Past Due Loans 
  (Dollars in thousands) 

Nonperforming loans totaled   $87.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $53.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  , and   $44.0 million   at   September 30, 2015  . Nonperforming loan inflows, which are primarily composed of potential problem loans moving through the workout process (i.e., moving from potential problem to nonperforming status), were $82.3 million for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , with seven credit relationships representing 86% of total inflows for the period. Nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans were   0.60%   at   September 30, 2016  , up from   0.41%   at   December 31, 2015  , and   0.34%   at   September 30, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  

OREO totaled   $12.0 million   compared to   $7.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  , with $8.1 million of total outstanding OREO at   September 30, 2016   consisting of an individual property that transferred into OREO during first quarter 2016. This inflow was partially offset by sales of OREO and valuation adjustments as we continue to dispose and settle properties.  
    
  As a result of the activity described above for nonperforming loans and OREO, nonperforming assets   increased     63%   from year end 2015 to   $99.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and increased 75% from   September 30, 2015  . Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were   0.52%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.35%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , special mention and potential problem loans in aggregate totaled $278.7 million, increasing $26.3 million from   December 31, 2015  , reflecting some level of credit migration. At   September 30, 2016  , commercial loans comprised $128.1 million, or 96% of total potential problems loan, with six credit relationships representing over 50% of the total. Because our loan portfolio contains loans that may be larger in size, changes in the performance of larger credits may from time to time create fluctuations in our credit quality metrics, including nonperforming, special mention and potential problem loans.

Credit Quality Management and Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  We maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the consolidated statements of financial condition date. The allowance for loan losses is assessed quarterly and represents an accounting estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date based on a review of available and relevant information at that time. The allowance contains reserves for identified probable losses relating to specific borrowing relationships that are considered to be impaired (the  specific component  of the allowance) and for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio that have not been specifically identified (the  general allocated component  of the allowance). The general allocated component is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors and management judgment applied to defined segments of our loan portfolio. 
    
  The accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the allowance for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed more fully in   Note 1   of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  of our   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The following table presents our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates shown. 
    
  Table 17 
  Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses 
  (Dollars in thousands) 

Specific Component of the Allowance 
    
  The specific reserve requirements are the summation of individual reserves related to impaired loans that are analyzed on a loan-by-loan basis at the balance sheet date. At   September 30, 2016  , the specific reserve component of the allowance totaled   $11.9 million  , up from   $7.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in specific reserves from year end 2015 was largely attributable to borrower irregularities identified during third quarter 2016 with a single lending relationship which added $5.6 million to such reserves. Of the   $151.6 million   in impaired loans at   September 30, 2016  , and the   $70.3 million   in impaired loans at   December 31, 2015  ,   53%   and   54%  , respectively, required a specific reserve. 
    
  General Allocated Component of the Allowance 
    
  The general allocated component of the allowance is determined using a methodology that is a function of quantitative and qualitative factors and considerations applied to segments of our loan portfolio. Our methodology applies a historical loss model that takes into account at a product level (e.g., commercial, CRE, construction, etc.) the default and loss history of similar products or sub-products using a look-back period that begins in 2010 and is updated with monthly data on a lagged quarter to the most recent period. 

80 

     Table of Contents  

Our methodology uses our default and loss history over the look-back period to establish a probability of default ( PD ) for each product type (and, in some cases, sub-segments within a product type) and risk rating, as well as an expected loss given default ( LGD ) for each product type. For our consumer portfolio, we assign a PD to each delinquency period and LGD to collateral position or size of credit for personal loans instead of product type. Our methodology applies the PD and LGD to the applicable loan balances and produces a loss estimate by product that is inclusive of the loss emergence period. 
    
  We assess the appropriate balance of the general allocated component of the reserve at the model loss emergence period based on a variety of internal and external quantitative and qualitative factors giving consideration to conditions that we believe are not fully reflected in the model-generated loss estimates. Topics considered in this assessment include changes in lending practices and procedures (e.g., underwriting standards) internally and in our industry, changes in business or economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of loans, changes in staffing or management in our lending teams, changes in the quality of our results from loan reviews (which includes credit quality trends and risk rating accuracy), changes in underlying collateral values, recent portfolio performance, concentration risks, and other external factors such as legal or regulatory matters relevant to management s assessment of required reserve levels. In certain instances, these additional factors and judgments may lead to management s conclusion that the appropriate level of the reserve differs from the amount determined through the model-driven quantitative framework, with respect to a given product type. In determining the amount of any qualitative adjustment to be made to the quantitative model output, management may adjust the PD and/or LGD for a product type (or a sub-segment within a product type) to reflect conditions that it does not believe are reflected in historical loss rates and apply those adjusted PDs and LGDs to determine the impact on the model output, with the result used to inform management s determination of the appropriate qualitative adjustment to be made to the general allocated component for the product type. 
    
  In our evaluation of the quantitatively-determined amount and the adequacy of the allowance at   September 30, 2016  , we considered a number of factors for each product consistent with the considerations discussed in the prior paragraph. The following describes the primary management qualitative adjustments made to each product type in determining our reserve levels at   September 30, 2016  : 

Commercial   - Management increased the model output for this product type to reflect: the overall slowdown in the U.S. manufacturing industry by considering our own PD versus industry-wide default rates; increased leverage metrics on existing borrowers within the portfolio; and competitive loan structures in the industry. Management increased LGDs used for the general commercial and industrial segment to reduce the impact of recoveries relating to loans charged off in older periods. Management also increased the LGDs used for the asset-based lending sub-segment based on industry data because we do not have loss experience in recent years for this sub-segment. 
                
    Commercial Real Estate   - Management increased the model output to reflect: industry level default rate experience in portfolios where we lack loss experience; compression of capitalization rates in the industry; and competitive loan structures in the industry. Management increased LGDs to reduce the impact of recoveries relating to loans charged off in older periods. Management also adjusted PD rates in instances where calculations using historical loss experience are not expected to be representative of management s estimated losses at the consolidated statements of financial condition date. 
                
    Construction   - Management increased the model output to reflect: industry level default rate experience in portfolios where we lack loss experience; compression of capitalization rates in the industry; and competition in the market and less stringent loan structures. Management also adjusted PD rates in instances where calculations using historical loss experience are not expected to be representative of management s estimated losses at the consolidated statements of financial condition date. 
                
    Consumer   - Management increased the model output to reflect: borrowers  credit strength and willingness to purchase homes (e.g., due to high student debt levels); and general economic conditions and interest rate trends that impact these products. 
     Management also considers a pro-rated amount and characteristics of the accruing TDRs removed from the general reserve formulas as a proxy for potentially heightened risk in the portfolio when establishing final reserve requirements. 
    
  In determining our reserve levels at   September 30, 2016  , we established a general reserve that includes management s qualitative assessment discussed above, which increased the reserve to a higher output than the model s quantitative output, in total. This judgment was influenced primarily by recent indicators in our commercial portfolio, such as the increasing leverage metrics for some existing borrowers, impact of commodity prices in certain sectors of the manufacturing portfolio, changes in underwriting standards, and volume and nature of loan growth, which have not yet been fully incorporated into the model output. 
    
  The general allocated component of the allowance increased by $14.9 million, or 10%, from   $153.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  , to   $168.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The increase in the general allocated reserve primarily reflects the   $1.4 billion     growth    
  
   81 

     Table of Contents  

in the loan portfolio in the first nine months of 2016 and changes in the credit quality of the existing portfolio for certain sectors in the commercial portfolio, specifically in the portfolio of leveraged commercial and industrial loans. 
    
  The establishment of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment and estimation which includes an inherent level of imprecision given the difficulty of identifying all the factors impacting loan repayment and the timing of when losses will actually occur. While management utilizes its best judgment and available information, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, client performance, the economy, changes in interest rates and property values, and the interpretation by regulatory authorities of loan classifications. 
    
  Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately and consider this process to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. 
    
  Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reviews the underlying methodology with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors quarterly. As of   September 30, 2016  , management concluded the allowance for loan losses was adequate (i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that are inherent in the portfolio at that date, including for those loans where the loss is not yet identifiable). 
    
  As an integral part of their examination process, various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.

  Activity in the Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The allowance for loan losses   increase  d   $19.5 million   to   $180.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $160.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  , and was largely reflective of the   $1.4 billion   of loan growth during the first   nine months   of   2016   and some credit migration, including higher nonperforming loan levels that drove an increase in the specific reserve. The allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was   1.23%   at   September 30, 2016   and   1.21%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Gross charge-offs   increased   to   $5.1 million   for   third quarter 2016  , from   $1.0 million   for the year ago period and   $2.9 million   for   second quarter 2016  . Commercial loans comprised   95%   of total charge-offs in   third quarter 2016  , and were elevated on a comparative basis largely related to a single relationship that was identified during the quarter, resulting in a $4.3 million charge-off.  
    
  The provision for loan losses is the expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income to adjust the allowance for loan losses to the level deemed appropriate by management, as determined through application of our allowance methodology. The  
  
   83 

     Table of Contents  

provision for loan losses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $15.9 million  , up from   $5.6 million   for the prior quarter and   $4.2 million   for   third quarter 2015  . The provision will fluctuate from period to period depending on the level of loan growth and unevenness in credit quality due to the size of individual credits and expect our provision expense going forward to be driven by changes to the general allocated reserve component due to overall loan growth and credit performance and, if necessary, any new specific reserves that may be required.  
    
  Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 
    
  In addition to the allowance for loan losses, we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments at a level we believe to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our reserve for unfunded commitments   increased   $3.8 million from   $11.8 million   at   December 31, 2015  , to   $15.6 million   and was largely comprised of general reserves at   September 30, 2016  . For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the general reserves increased $4.2 million, driven by growth in residential construction commitments and increases in commercial special mention and potential problem commitments that resulted in higher requirements while specific reserves declined to approximately $100,000 as a result of credit resolutions during 2016. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Unfunded commitments, excluding covered assets, totaled   $6.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , unfunded commitments with maturities of less than one year approximated $1.7 billion. For further information on our unfunded commitments, refer to   Note 16   of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in   Item 1   of this Quarterly Report on   Form 10-Q  . 

COVERED ASSETS 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , covered assets represent acquired residential mortgage loans and foreclosed loan collateral covered under a loss share agreement with the FDIC and include an indemnification receivable representing the present value of the expected reimbursement from the FDIC related to expected losses on the covered assets. The loss share agreement will expire on September 30, 2019. 
    
  Total covered assets, net of allowance for covered loan losses,   declined   by   $2.2 million  , or   11%  , from   $21.2 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $19.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The reduction was primarily attributable to $2.7 million in principal paydowns, net of advances, as well as the impact of such on the evaluation of expected cash flows and discount accretion levels. At   September 30, 2016  , the indemnification receivable totaled $1.6 million, compared to $1.7 million at   December 31, 2015  . Because the remaining covered assets largely represent single-family mortgages, we do not expect a significant change in balances from period to period. Total delinquent and nonperforming covered loans totaled $2.7 million at   September 30, 2016  , and $5.2 million at   December 31, 2015  . 

FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT 
    
  We manage our liquidity position in order to meet our cash flow requirements, maintain sufficient capacity to meet our clients  needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations. We also have contingency funding plans designed to allow us to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding may be constrained. As part of our asset/liability management strategy, we utilize a variety of funding sources in an effort to optimize the balance of duration risk, cost, liquidity risk and contingency planning. 
    
  We maintain liquidity at levels we believe sufficient to meet anticipated client liquidity needs, fund anticipated loan growth, and selectively purchase securities and investments. Liquid assets refer to cash on hand, Federal funds ( Fed funds ) sold and securities. Net liquid assets represent liquid assets less the amount of such assets pledged to secure deposits, repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings that require collateral and to satisfy contractual obligations. Net liquid assets at the Bank were $3.5 billion and $2.9 billion at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Bank s principal sources of funds are commercial deposits, some of which are large institutional deposits and deposits that are classified for regulatory purposes as brokered deposits, and retail deposits. In addition to deposits, we utilize FHLB advances and other sources of funding to support our balance sheet and liquidity needs. Cash from operations is also a source of funds. The Bank s principal uses of funds include funding growth in the loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, our investment portfolio, which is designed to be highly liquid to serve collateral needs and support liquidity risk management. In managing our levels of cash on-hand, we consider factors such as deposit movement trends (which can be influenced by changing economic conditions, client specific needs to support their businesses, including transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures, and the overall composition of our deposit base) and other needs of the Bank. 

84 

     Table of Contents  

The primary sources of funding for the Holding Company include dividends received from the Bank, intercompany tax reimbursements from the Bank, and proceeds from the issuance of senior and subordinated debt and equity. As an additional source of funding, the Holding Company has a 364-day revolving line of credit with a group of commercial banks allowing borrowings of up to   $60.0 million   in total. As of   September 30, 2016  , no amounts were drawn on the facility. The Holding Company had   $50.4 million   in cash at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $61.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Our cash flows are comprised of three classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities primarily include results of operations for the period, adjusted for items in net income that did not impact cash. Net cash provided by operating activities   increased   by   $19.2 million   from the prior year period to   $259.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Cash flows from investing activities reflect the impact of growth in loans and investments acquired for our interest-earning asset portfolios, as well as asset maturities and sales. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities was   $1.9 billion  , compared to   $1.4 billion   for the prior year period. Cash flows from financing activities include transactions and events whereby cash is obtained from and/or paid to depositors, creditors or investors. Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , was   $1.7 billion  , compared to   $1.1 billion   for the prior year period. The current period reflected net increases in FHLB advances of $510.0 million to support loan growth and a net increase in deposit accounts of $1.1 billion.  
    
  Deposits 
    
  Our deposit base is predominately composed of middle market commercial client relationships from a diversified industry base. We offer a suite of deposit and cash management products and services that support our efforts to attract and retain commercial clients. These deposits are generated principally through the development of long-term relationships with clients. Approximately 70% of our deposits at   September 30, 2016  , were accounts managed by our commercial business groups. 
    
  Through our community banking and private wealth groups, we offer a variety of small business and personal banking products, including checking, savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit ( CDs ). Approximately 27% of our deposits at   September 30, 2016  , were accounts managed by our community banking and private wealth groups. 
    
  Public fund balances, denoting the funds held on account for municipalities and other public entities, are included as part of our total deposits. We enter into specific agreements with certain public clients to pledge collateral, primarily securities, in support of their balances on deposit. At   September 30, 2016  , we had public funds on deposit totaling $888.0 million, or approximately 6% of our deposits. Changes in public fund balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as the general level of interest rates. 
    
  The following table provides a comparison of deposits by category for the periods presented. 
    
  Table 19 
  Deposits 
  (Dollars in thousands) 

Total deposits at   September 30, 2016  ,   increased     $1.1 billion  , or 8%, to   $15.5 billion   from   year end 2015  , and included growth of $501.8 million in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Total average deposit growth since year end 2015 was $819.4 million. Given the predominantly commercial nature of our client base, we experience fluctuations in our deposit base from time to time due to large deposit movements in certain client accounts, such as in connection with client-specific corporate acquisitions and divestitures. In addition to the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in deposit balances that we sometimes experience given client-specific events, the nature of our commercial client base has historically led to gradually increasing deposit balances in the second  
  
   85 

     Table of Contents  

half of the year compared to the first half, although there is no assurance that this historical trend will repeat in future years. Our loan to deposit ratio was   95%   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   92%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Since   December 31, 2015  , we have added $538.2 million in new deposits from clients in the financial services industry, such as securities broker-dealers ( BDs ) for which we serve as a program bank in their cash sweep programs (as discussed in more detail below under  Brokered Deposits ), hedge funds and fund administrators and futures commission merchants ( FCMs ). Financial services clients have a higher propensity to generate larger transactional flows than our typical commercial client, which can result in temporary deposits, especially around period ends. Furthermore, some of these deposits, particularly from hedge funds, fund administrators and FCMs, may exhibit elevated volatility due to the more complex liquidity and cash flow needs of the depositors given the nature of their businesses. This volatility can further contribute to the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our deposit base that we referenced in the preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the larger transactional flows and potential for elevated volatility, we intend to continue utilizing deposits from financial services firms to meet our funding requirements from client needs, such as loan growth. In light of our loan-to-deposit levels and loan growth over the past several periods, our ability to continue growing our loan portfolio may be influenced in part by our ability to continue attracting deposits, including those from financial services clients. 
    
  Because of the predominantly commercial nature of our deposit base, including from the financial services industry, we historically have had larger average deposit balances per deposit relationship than a retail-focused bank. Furthermore, a meaningful portion of our deposit base is comprised of large commercial deposit relationships, some of which are classified as brokered deposits for regulatory purposes (as discussed in more detail below under  Brokered Deposits ). The following table presents a comparison of our large deposit relationships as of the dates shown. Of our large deposit relationships of $75 million or more shown in the table below, over half of the deposits are from financial services-related businesses.

    The CDARS        deposit program is a deposit services arrangement that effectively achieves FDIC deposit insurance for jumbo deposit relationships. 
       
  The regulatory definition of brokered deposits includes any non-proprietary funds deposited, or referred for deposit, with a depository institution by a third party.  Traditional  brokered time deposits primarily refer to CDs issued in wholesale amounts through a broker-dealer and held in book-entry form at The Depository Trust   Clearing Corporation as well as CDs issued through third-party auction services. The regulatory definition of brokered deposits also encompasses certain deposits that we generate through more direct relationships with third parties. Examples of these  non-traditional  brokered deposits include cash sweep programs operated by BDs with which we have entered into a contract to serve as a program bank (which are discussed in more detail below) and funds administered by service providers, such as escrow agents, title companies, mortgage servicers and property managers, on behalf of third parties. With respect to these third-party service providers, we may in some cases have additional banking relationships with them and their affiliates. Our non-traditional brokered deposits are maintained across various account types, including demand, money market and time deposits, based on the needs of our clients. We believe that many of these deposits, despite falling within the definition of brokered deposits for regulatory purposes, generally constitute a stable, cost-effective source of funding and, accordingly, from a liquidity risk management perspective, we view them differently from traditional brokered time deposits. We consider the non-traditional brokered deposits as an important component of our relationship-based commercial banking business, whereas we use traditional brokered time deposits as a source of longer-term funding to complement deposits generated through relationships with our clients. As part of our liquidity risk management program, we consider characteristics other than regulatory classification, such as pricing, volatility, duration and our relationship with the depositor, when assessing the stability and overall value of deposits to us. 
    
  Total brokered deposits, as defined for regulatory reporting purposes, represented   24%   of total deposits at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   22%   of total deposits at   December 31, 2015  . However, traditional brokered time deposits represented   3%   of total deposits at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Traditional brokered deposits have a weighted average maturity date of approximately 2 years. 
  As noted above, a significant source of non-traditional brokered deposits are cash sweep programs operated by BDs. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  ,   $1.6 billion  , or approximately   45%  , and   $1.5 billion  , or approximately   48%  , respectively, of our total regulatory-defined brokered deposits consisted of deposits from cash sweep programs operated by BDs for which we serve as a program bank. Cash sweep programs enable the BDs  brokerage clients to  sweep  their cash balances into an omnibus bank deposit account established at a third-party depository institution by the BD as agent or custodian for the benefit of its clients. The contracts governing our participation as a program bank have a specified term, set forth the pricing terms for the deposits and generally provide for minimum and maximum deposit levels that the BDs will have with us at any given time.

     Table of Contents  

Unlike traditional brokered time deposits, cash sweep program deposits are typically maintained in money market accounts and may be eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately 84% of the cash sweep program deposit balances were attributable to BDs who have had a deposit relationship with us for more than four years. In   Table 20  , Large Deposit Relationships, above, $1.6 billion of cash sweep program deposits were included in the deposit amounts attributable to deposit relationships of $75.0 million or more. 
    
  Borrowings 
    
  To supplement our deposit flows, we utilize a variety of wholesale funding sources and other borrowings both to fund our operations and serve as contingency funding. We maintain access to multiple external sources of funding to assist in the prudent management of funding costs, interest rate risk, and anticipated funding needs or other considerations. In addition, in constructing our overall mix of funding sources, we also factor in our desire to have a diversity of funding sources available to us. Some of our funding sources are accessible same-day, while others require advance notice, and some sources require the pledging of collateral, while others are unsecured. Our sources of additional funding liabilities are described below: 

Fed Funds Counterparty Lines   - Fed funds counterparty lines are immediately accessible uncommitted lines of credit from other financial institutions. The borrowing term is typically overnight. Availability of Fed funds lines fluctuates based on market conditions, counterparty relationship strength and the amount of excess reserve balances held by counterparties. 
                
    Federal Reserve Discount Window   - The discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank (the  FRB ) is an additional source of overnight funding. We maintain access to the discount window primary credit program by pledging loans as collateral. Funding availability is uncommitted and primarily dictated by the amount of loans pledged and the advance rate applied by the FRB to the pledged loans. The amount of loans pledged to the FRB can fluctuate due to the availability of loans that are eligible under the FRB s criteria, which include stipulations of documentation requirements, credit quality, payment status and other criteria. 
                
    Repurchase Agreements   - Repurchase agreements are agreements to sell securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities at a specified maturity date, generally within 1 to 90 days from the transaction date.  
                
    FHLB Advances   - As a member of the FHLB Chicago, we have access to borrowing capacity, which is uncommitted and subject to change based on the availability of acceptable collateral to pledge and the level of our investment in stock of the FHLB Chicago. FHLB advances can be either short-term or long-term borrowings. Short-term advances historically have had a term of one to three days. Of the total $1.2 billion in short-term FHLB advances outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , $630.0 million represented overnight funding and was repaid on October 3, 2016.  
                
    Revolving Line of Credit   - The Company has a 364-day revolving line of credit with a group of commercial banks allowing us to borrow up to $60.0 million. The maturity date is the earlier of   September 22, 2017   or the consummation of the Company s merger with CIBC. The interest rate applied on the line of credit is, at our election, either 30-day or 90-day LIBOR plus   1.75%   or Prime minus   0.50%  . We have the option to elect to convert any amounts outstanding under the line of credit, whether at maturity or before, to an amortizing term loan, with the balance of such loan due   September 22, 2019   (subject to earlier maturity upon consummation of the merger with CIBC, as previously noted). We maintain the line primarily as an additional source of funding and have not drawn on it since inception. 
                
    Long-Term Debt, excluding FHLB Advances   - As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding   $167.6 million   of variable and fixed rate unsecured junior subordinated debentures issued to   four   statutory trusts that issued Trust Preferred Securities, which currently qualify as Tier 1 capital and mature as follows:   $8.2 million   in   2034  ;   $92.8 million   in   2035   and   $66.6 million   in   2068  . We also had outstanding   $120.6 million   of fixed rate unsecured subordinated debentures, which currently qualify as Tier 2 capital and mature in   2042  . 
       
  In addition to the foregoing, we also have access to the brokered deposit market, through which we have numerous alternatives and significant capacity, if needed. The availability and access to the brokered deposit market is subject to market conditions, our capital levels, our counterparty strength and other factors.

We would be required to invest an additional $37.8 million in FHLB Chicago stock to obtain this level of borrowing capacity. 

CAPITAL 
    
  Equity totaled   $1.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  ,   increasing   by   $183.4 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  , primarily attributable to   $148.8 million   of net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and a   $16.7 million     increase   in accumulated other comprehensive income, largely due to an increase in market values on our available-for-sale investment portfolio.

Shares Issued in Connection with Share-Based Compensation Plans and Stock Repurchases 
    
  We reissue treasury stock (at average cost), when available, or issue new shares to fulfill our obligation to issue shares granted pursuant to share-based compensation plans. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we issued 672,531 shares of common stock (representing a combination of newly issued shares and the reissuance of treasury stock) in connection with such plans largely due to annual equity award grants and the exercise of stock options, net of forfeitures. We held   zero   shares of voting common stock as treasury stock at   September 30, 2016  , and   2,574   shares at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  We currently do not have a stock repurchase program in place; however, we have repurchased shares in connection with the administration of our employee benefit plans. Under the terms of these plans, we accept shares of common stock from plan participants if they elect to surrender previously-owned shares upon exercise of options to cover the exercise price or, in the case of both restricted shares of common stock or stock options, the withholding of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted shares or exercise of stock options. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased 129,110 shares of common stock at an average price of $36.54 per share. 
    
  Dividends 
    
  We declared dividends of   $0.01   per common share during   third quarter 2016  , unchanged from   third quarter 2015  . Based on our closing stock price on   September 30, 2016  , of   $45.92   per share, the annualized dividend yield on our common stock was   0.09%  . The dividend payout ratio, which represents the percentage of common dividends declared to stockholders to basic earnings per share, was   1.64%   for   third quarter 2016   compared to   1.72%   for   third quarter 2015  . Our Board of Directors periodically evaluates our dividend payout ratio, taking into consideration internal capital guidelines, and our strategic objectives and business plans, but we have no current plans to raise the amount of dividends currently paid on our common stock. Furthermore, the merger agreement that we have entered into with CIBC restricts us from increasing our dividend prior to the merger without the prior consent of CIBC, which we would not expect to receive. 
    
  For additional information regarding limitations and restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, refer to the  Supervision and Regulation  and  Risk Factors  sections of our   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Capital Management 
    
  Under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank are subject to various capital requirements adopted and administered by the federal banking agencies. These guidelines specify minimum capital ratios calculated in accordance with the definitions in the guidelines, including the leverage ratio, which is Tier 1 capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets, and the Tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity Tier 1 and the total risk-based capital ratios, which are calculated based on risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories. 
    
  In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, we are required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity Tier 1 capital, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions (including dividends and stock repurchases) and discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The required amount of the capital conservation buffer is being phased-in, beginning at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing by an additional 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. We have included the 0.625% increase for 2016 in our minimum capital adequacy ratios in the table below. The capital buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis on January 1, 2019. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements on a fully phased-in basis as if all such requirements were currently in effect. 
    
  To satisfy safety and soundness standards, banking institutions are expected to maintain capital levels in excess of the regulatory minimums depending on the risk inherent in the balance sheet, regulatory expectations and the changing risk profile of business activities. Under our capital management policy, we conduct periodic stress testing of our capital adequacy and target capital ratios at levels above regulatory minimums that we believe are appropriate based on various other risk considerations, including the current operating and economic environment and outlook, internal risk guidelines, and our strategic objectives as well as regulatory expectations.

  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our   $167.6 million   of outstanding junior subordinated debentures held by trusts that issued Trust Preferred Securities are included in Tier 1 capital and all of our outstanding Trust Preferred Securities are redeemable by us at any time, subject to receipt of any required regulatory approvals and, in the case of the remaining   $66.6 million   of 10% Debentures issued by PrivateBancorp Capital Trust IV, compliance with the terms of the replacement capital covenant. Upon completion of our pending merger with CIBC, we expect the outstanding Trust Preferred Securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital and would be treated as Tier 2 capital under current FRB regulations. The post-merger capital structure of the successor holding company is currently under evaluation, including possible redemption of some or all of the outstanding Trust Preferred Securities. Our outstanding 7.125% subordinated debentures due 2042, also Tier 2 instruments, are redeemable on or after October 30, 2017. Redemption of any of these securities would be subject to regulatory approval and no definitive plans regarding potential changes to capital structure have yet been made. The terms of the merger agreement restrict us from redeeming any securities prior to completion of the merger without CIBC s consent.

NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
    
  This report   contains both U.S. GAAP and non-U.S. GAAP based financial measures. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures include net interest income, net interest margin, net revenue, operating profit, and efficiency ratio all on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, return on average tangible common equity, tangible common equity to tangible assets, and tangible book value. We believe that presenting these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures will provide information useful to investors in understanding our  
  
   91 

     Table of Contents  

underlying operational performance, our business, and performance trends and facilitates comparisons with the performance of others in the banking industry. 
    
  We use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating various performance measures by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments assuming a 35% tax rate. Management believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it enhances comparability to net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources, and accordingly believes that providing this measure may be useful for peer comparison purposes. 
    
  In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, we also consider various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including return on average tangible common equity, tangible common equity to tangible assets, and tangible book value. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. All of these measures exclude the ending balances of goodwill and other intangibles while certain of these ratios exclude preferred capital components. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, we believe there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. We believe these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are relevant because they provide information that is helpful in assessing the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of our capitalization to other similar companies. However, because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, our calculations may not be comparable with other companies. 
    
  Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under U.S. GAAP. As a result, we encourage readers to consider our Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ), and our accounting policies are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry. Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments based on information available at the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future changes in information may affect these estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which, in turn, may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and fair value measurements are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial position and results of operations and, as such, are considered to be critical accounting policies. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  presented in Note 1 of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  and the section titled  Critical Accounting Policies  in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations both included in our   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  , as well as the section titled  Credit Quality Management and Allowance for Credit Losses  in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included earlier in this Form 10-Q. There have been no significant changes in our application of critical accounting policies since   December 31, 2015  . 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE 
  DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  As a continuing part of our asset/liability management, we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. We may manage interest rate risk by structuring the asset and liability characteristics of our balance sheet and/or by executing derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. We use interest rate derivatives as part of our asset liability management strategy to hedge interest rate risk in our primarily floating-rate loan portfolio and, depending on market and other conditions, we may alter this program and enter into or terminate additional interest rate swaps. 

95 

     Table of Contents  

Interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously. There are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our consolidated statements of income. 
    
  The majority of our interest-earning assets are floating-rate instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   79%   of the total loan portfolio is indexed to LIBOR, including   70%   indexed to one month LIBOR, and   16%   of the total loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate. Of the   $10.0 billion   in loans maturing after one year with a floating interest rate,   $916.9 million   are subject to interest rate floors, of which   53%   were in effect at   September 30, 2016  , and are reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis below. In addition, commencing in 2016, we have included contractual language in loan agreements that establishes a floor of 0% for loans with LIBOR indices, protecting the Company in the event of negative LIBOR rates. To manage the interest rate risk of our balance sheet, we have the ability to use a combination of financial instruments, including medium-term and short-term financings, variable-rate debt instruments, fixed-rate loans and securities and interest rate swaps. 
    
  We use a simulation model to estimate the potential impact of various interest rate changes on our income statement and our interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability portfolios. The starting point of the analysis is the current size and nature of these portfolios at the beginning of the measurement period as well as the then-current applicable pricing structures. During the twelve-month measurement period, the model re-prices assets and liabilities based on the contractual terms and market rates in effect at the beginning of the measurement period assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in the applicable yield curves and instruments then remain at that new interest rate through the end of the twelve-month measurement period. The model analyzes changes in the portfolios based only on assets and liabilities at the beginning of the measurement period and does not assume any asset or liability growth over the following twelve months. 
    
  The sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels, the shape of the yield curve, prepayments on loans and securities, levels of excess deposits, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others. While our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change. In addition, the simulation model assumes certain one-time instantaneous interest rate shifts that are consistent across all yield curves and do not continue to change over the measurement period. As such, these assumptions and modeling reflect an estimation of the sensitivity to interest rates or market risk and do not predict the timing and direction of interest rates or the shape and steepness of the yield curves. Therefore, the actual results may differ materially from these simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. 
    
  Modeling the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process. These assumptions are periodically reviewed and updated in the context of various internal and external factors including balance sheet changes, product offerings, product mix, external micro- and macro-economic factors, anticipated client behavior and anticipated Company and market pricing behavior, all of which may occur in dynamic and non-linear fashion. We routinely conduct historical deposit re-pricing and deposit lifespan/retention analyses and adjust our forward-looking assumptions related to client and market behavior. Based on our analyses and judgments, we recently modified core deposit product repricing characteristics and retention periods, as well as average life estimates, used in our interest rate risk modeling which reflects higher interest rate sensitivity of our deposits. 
    
  Based on our current simulation modeling assumptions, the following table shows the estimated impact of an immediate change in interest rates as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Analysis of Net Interest Income Sensitivity 
  (Dollars in thousands) 

96 

     Table of Contents  

The table above illustrates the estimated impact to our net interest income over a one-year period reflected in dollar terms and percentage change. As an example, if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of   +100   basis points on   September 30, 2016  , net interest income would increase by   $50.8 million  , or   9.0%  , over a twelve-month period, as compared to an increase in net interest income of   $34.2 million  , or   6.6%  , if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of   +100   basis points at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in the above interest rate asset sensitivity at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  , is due to a net increase in rate-sensitive assets. Rate-sensitive assets, particularly loans indexed to short-term rates, increased during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The increase was funded by rate-sensitive liabilities, primarily deposits and short-term borrowings. Overall asset sensitivity increased during 2016 due primarily to asset and liability compositional changes, including a decrease in our cash flow hedge portfolio. Based on our modeling, the Company remains in an asset sensitive position and expects to benefit from a rise in interest rates. We note, however, that   79%   of our loans are indexed to LIBOR, mostly one-month LIBOR, and there can be no guarantee that action by the Federal Reserve to change the target Fed funds rate will cause an immediate parallel shift in short-term LIBOR. We will continue to periodically review and refine, as appropriate, the assumptions used in our interest rate risk modeling. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report (the  Evaluation Date ), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  Since the announcement of the proposed transaction with CIBC, three stockholders of the Company have filed separate putative class actions on behalf of our public stockholders in the Cook County Circuit Court, Chicago, Illinois. The three actions have been consolidated and styled   In re PrivateBancorp, Inc. Shareholder Litigation  , 2016-CH-08949. All of the actions name as defendants the Company and each of its directors individually. The complaints assert that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed transaction. Two of the complaints are also brought against CIBC and assert that the Company and CIBC aided and abetted the directors  alleged breaches. The actions broadly allege that the transaction was the result of a flawed process, that the price is unfair, and that certain provisions of the merger agreement might dissuade a potential suitor from making a competing offer, among other things. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint, adding a claim alleging breaches of the fiduciary duty of disclosure by the directors. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, including damages. The plaintiffs in the three actions recently have agreed in principle not to pursue the actions as a result of the inclusion of certain additional disclosures in the proxy statement for the Company s special meeting of stockholders. The defendants, including the Company, believe the demands and complaints are without merit and there are substantial legal and factual defenses to the claims asserted. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   and in the ordinary course of business, there were various other legal proceedings pending against the Company and our subsidiaries that are incidental to our regular business operations. Management does not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
    
  For a discussion of risk factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations, refer to   Part I  ,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  of the Company's   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015  .  Except as set forth below with respect to risk factors related to the merger with CIBC, there have been no material changes in the risk factors set forth in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Risk Factors Related to the Merger 
    
  We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business. 
    
  Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on our employees and clients may have an adverse effect on the Company and, consequently, the surviving corporation. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause clients and others that deal with us to seek to change our existing business relationships. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to uncertainty about the timing of closing the merger, the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, our business prior to the merger (and CIBC s business following the merger) could be negatively impacted. In addition, until the merger occurs, the merger agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions or entering into new lines of business, entering into or modifying material contracts and taking other specified actions without the consent of CIBC. These restrictions may prevent or delay us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger. The merger agreement also restricts us from increasing our dividend prior to the merger. 
    
  The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed. 
    
  The merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include, among others, the approval of the merger proposal by our stockholders, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals (which include approvals of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada), the Federal Reserve Board and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation) and expiration or termination of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof, the accuracy of representations and warranties under the merger agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement), CIBC s and the Company s performance of their respective obligations under the merger agreement in all material respects and each of CIBC s and the Company s receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the merger will be treated as a  reorganization  within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed. 
    
  In addition, if the merger is not completed by June 29, 2017, either CIBC or the Company may choose not to proceed with the merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after our stockholder approval has been obtained. In addition, CIBC and the Company may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $150 million to CIBC. 
    
  Failure to complete the merger at all, or a material delay in completing the merger, could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results. 
    
  If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders declining to approve the merger agreement or the failure of the parties to obtain the required regulatory approvals, or if we and CIBC experience a material delay in completing the merger, our stock price and ongoing business may be adversely affected. In such case, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 

we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price; 
                
    we may experience negative reactions from our clients, employees and/or vendors, and if there is a material delay in completing the merger, we may find it more challenging to retain our clients and key employees due to the perceived uncertainty about the transaction; 
                
    we will have incurred substantial transaction-related expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed; 
                
    the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the merger and such restrictions (the waiver of which is subject to the reasonable consent of CIBC) may prevent or delay us from making certain acquisitions or entering into new lines of business, entering into or modifying material contracts and taking other specified actions without the consent of CIBC during the pendency of the merger; 
                
    matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company; and 
                
    during the pendency of the merger, our stock price is likely to be impacted by factors affecting CIBC s ongoing business, prospects and stock price because a majority of the merger consideration is in the form of CIBC common shares; the  
     
   98 

     Table of Contents  

longer period of time that the merger is pending, the more our stockholders (including employee stockholders) may be exposed to fluctuations in the price of CIBC common shares, which could have an adverse impact on our business. 
    
  In addition to the above risks, if the merger agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration CIBC has agreed to provide in the merger. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
    
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
    
  The following table summarizes the Company s monthly common stock purchases during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , which are solely in connection with the administration of our employee share-based compensation plans.

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors 
  PrivateBancorp, Inc. 
    
  We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition of PrivateBancorp, Inc. (the  Company ) as of   September 30, 2016  , and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the three- and   nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the consolidated statement of changes in equity and cash flows for the   nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016  and   2015  . These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
    
  We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
    
  Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
    
  We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition of the Company as of   December 31, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, not presented herein, and we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements in our report dated   February 25, 2016  . In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition as of   December 31, 2015  , is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of financial condition from which it has been derived.
