                              The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.        6            GOTHAM CAPITAL HOLDINGS, INC.         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015     (UNAUDITED)         1.     THE COMPANY        Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. (F/K/A Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation) (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of New Jersey on October 1, 2003.  It was formed pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of Creative Beauty Supply, Inc., ( CBS ) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of that company, a publicly traded New Jersey corporation.  On January 1, 2004, the assets and liabilities of CBS were contributed at book value to the Company, and this subsidiary was then spun-off by CBS to its stockholders.         The Company s current business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company.  In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or wish to contribute assets to the Company rather than merge.       No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company.  The Company provides a means for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting (public) company whose securities would be qualified for trading in the United States secondary market.       The Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions to amend their Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares to 200,000,000 (See note 3), to amend Articles of Incorporation to change the Company s name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc., and to authorize a 1-for-2 reverse split of all outstanding common shares. The corporation s actions became effective as of May 18, 2015.        On April 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) with Gotham Capital, Inc. and certain Gotham Capital, Inc. shareholders which would have resulted in a change of control of the Company upon execution of the agreement. On July 22, 2016, both parties signed a mutual release which agrees to settle disputes and differences that have arisen between the two parties and cancelled the SPA. The Company has received a reimbursement of $20,000 for professional fees related to the agreement which has been recorded as miscellaneous income in the statement of operations  (See note 4).            7              2.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         Interim Financial Statement Presentation    The December 31, 2015 balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, its results of operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.       The statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.       While the Company believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company s annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.        Loss Per Share    The Company computes loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,  Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  Diluted earnings per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding, which includes convertible debentures, stock options and warrants.  There were no dilutive common stock equivalents for all periods presented.        Going Concern    The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.       As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred continuing operating losses and has an accumulated deficit of $774,149 at September 30, 2016. The Company has no revenue generating operations and has limited cash resources. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.            8           Management believes that it will be able to achieve a satisfactory level of liquidity to meet the Company s obligations through September 30, 2017 by obtaining additional financing from key officers, directors and certain investors. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain its operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.        Fair Value of Financial Instruments    The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.        Recently Issued Accounting Standards    Management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.        3.     STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY        Effective May 18, 2015, the Company increased the authorized shares to 200,000,000, 190,000,000 shares shall be designated common stock and have a par value of $0.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares shall be designated preferred stock and have a par value of $.001 per share. The Company also recorded a 1-for-2 reverse split of all outstanding common shares.       Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors in its discretion from funds legally available. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata in all assets  remaining after payment in full of all liabilities. All of the outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the Company s common stock. There are no conversion or redemption rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock.        4.     MISCELLANEOUS INCOME        On August 22, 2016 the Company received $20,000 as a reimbursement for professional fees paid in 2015.  The reimbursement has been classified as miscellaneous income in the Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (See note 1).            9              5.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS         The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financials were issued.                                                                                         10           Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        Forward-Looking Statements    This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements include those concerning the following:  Our intentions, beliefs and expectations regarding the fair value of all assets and liabilities recorded; our strategies; growth opportunities; product development and introduction relating to new and existing products; the enterprise market and related opportunities; competition and competitive advantages and disadvantages; industry standards and compatibility of our products; relationships with our employees; our facilities, operating lease and our ability to secure additional space; cash dividends; excess inventory, our expenses; interest and other income; our beliefs and expectations about our future success and results; our operating results; our belief that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements, our expectations regarding our revenues and customers; investments and interest rates.  These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially.         Gotham Capital Holding, Inc. (F/K/A Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation) (the  Company ) undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q.        Critical Accounting Policies    The financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States with certain amounts based on management s best estimates and judgments. To determine appropriate carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, management uses assumptions based on historical results and other factors they believe are reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Our critical accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.        Trends and Uncertainties    There are no material commitments for capital expenditure at this time.  There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our limited operations. There are no known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of the Company s financial statements.            11            Liquidity and Capital Resources    At September 30, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $40,317, which represents a $11,462 increase from the $28,855 balance at December 31, 2015.  This increase was primarily the result of a cash expense reimbursement received net of cash used to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company.  The Company s working capital balance at September 30, 2016 was $12,492, as compared to a December 31, 2015 balance of $8,621.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net income of $3,871. We had the following adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: we had an increase of $14,166 due to accounts payable and a decrease of $6,575 due to accrued expenses. As a result, we had a net cash provided by in operating activities of $11,462 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $23,340. We had the following adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: we had a decrease of $10,813 due to accounts payable and a decrease of $9,075 due to accrued expenses. As a result, we had a net cash used in operating activities of $43,228 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no investing or financing activities.       The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred losses of from operations of $16,146 and $23,405 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and has an accumulated deficiency which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.       Management believes the Company will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever. Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company, but cannot assure that such financing will be available on accepted terms.       The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain additional financing as may be required. Our auditors have included a going concern qualification in their auditors  report dated April 1, 2016. Such a going concern qualification may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured.            12           The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business plan will actually improve the Company s operating results.        Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.        For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not earn any revenues. We incurred professional fees of $14,730 and miscellaneous expenses of $1,416. We earned interest income of $17 and received a $20,000 expense reimbursement for professional fees. As a result we had $3,871 income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       Comparatively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we did not earn any revenues. We incurred professional fees of $22,323 and miscellaneous expenses of $1,082. We earned interest income of $65. As a result, we incurred a net loss of $23,340 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       The Company had $3,871 in net income in the current period versus a net loss of $23,340 in the prior year. Operating expenses were incurred primarily to enable the Company to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company.       During the current and prior period, the Company did not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty associated with the Company s ability to utilize the deferred tax assets.        Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015.        For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not earn any revenues. We incurred professional fees of $4,654 and miscellaneous expense of $168. We earned interest income of $5 and received a $20,000 expense reimbursement for professional fees. As a result we had income of $15,183 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.        Comparatively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, we did not earn any revenues. We incurred professional fees of $12,358 and miscellaneous expenses of $-0-. We earned interest income of $16. As a result, we incurred a net loss of $12,342 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.       Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       Not applicable for a smaller reporting company.            13           Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures        We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.  Based on the existence of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide such reasonable assurances.        We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud.  Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.  Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any.  The design of disclosure controls and procedures is also based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.         Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses        At such time that it is economically feasible, we will aggressively recruit experienced professionals to ensure that we can maintain adequate segregation of duties and be able to ensure that all necessary disclosures are reported in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although we believe that this corrective step will enable management to conclude that the internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when the staff is hired and trained, we cannot assure you these steps will be sufficient.  We may be required to expend additional resources to identify, assess, and correct any additional weaknesses in internal control.             14            Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting        During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.                                                                     15            PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1.
