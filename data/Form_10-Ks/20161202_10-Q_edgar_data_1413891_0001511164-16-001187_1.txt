  1.  
  Organization and Going Concern  
 Mantra Venture Group Ltd. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 22, 2007 to acquire and commercially exploit various new energy related technologies through licenses and purchases. On December 8, 2008, the Company continued its corporate jurisdiction out of the State of Nevada and into the province of British Columbia, Canada. The Company is in the business of developing and providing energy alternatives. The Company also provides marketing and graphic design services to help companies optimize their environmental awareness presence through the eyes of government, industry and the general public.  
   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments of a recurring nature considered necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the periods shown. 
   
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 
   
 These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has yet to acquire commercially exploitable energy related technology, and is unlikely to generate earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of management to raise additional equity capital through private and public offerings of its common stock, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at August 31, 2016, the Company has an accumulated loss of $13,863,959, and a working capital deficit of $2,894,056. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  
   
 Management requires additional funds over the next twelve months to fully implement its business plan. Management is currently seeking additional financing through the sale of equity and from borrowings from private lenders to cover its operating expenditures. There can be no certainty that these sources will provide the additional funds required for the next twelve months.

  Significant Accounting Policies  
   
 a. 
 Basis of Presentation/Principles of Consolidation 
   
 These unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, Carbon Commodity Corporation, Climate ESCO Ltd., Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., Mantra China Inc., Mantra China Limited, Mantra Media Corp., Mantra NextGen Power Inc., and Mantra Wind Inc. All the subsidiaries are wholly-owned with the exception of Climate ESCO Ltd., which is 64.55% owned and Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., which is 88.21% owned. All inter- company balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

b. 
 Loss Per Share 
   
 The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share  which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti- dilutive. As at August 31, 2016, the Company had 243,619,532 (August 31, 2015   10,761,804) dilutive potential shares outstanding. 
   
 c. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
   
 The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

  9.  
  Convertible Debentures  
   
 (a) 
 In October 2008, the Company issued three convertible debentures for total proceeds of $250,000 which bear interest at 10% per annum, are unsecured, and due one year from date of issuance. The unpaid amount of principal and accrued interest can be converted at any time at the holder s option into 625,000 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $0.40 per share. The Company also issued 250,000 detachable, non-transferable share purchase warrants. Each share purchase warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional share of the Company s common stock for a period of two years from the date of issuance at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. 
   
 In accordance with ASC 470-20,   Debt with Conversion and Other Options  , the Company determined that the convertible debentures contained no embedded beneficial conversion feature as the convertible debentures were issued with a conversion price higher than the fair market value of the Company s common shares at the time of issuance. 
   
 In accordance with ASC 470-20, the Company allocated the proceeds of issuance between the convertible debt and the detachable share purchase warrants based on their relative fair values. Accordingly, the Company recognized the fair value of the share purchase warrants of $45,930 as additional paid-in capital and an equivalent discount against the convertible debentures. The Company had recorded accretion expense of $45,930, increasing the carrying value of the convertible debentures to $250,000. 
   
 On January 19, 2012, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with one of the debenture holders to settle a $50,000 convertible debenture and $122,535 in accounts payable and accrued interest with the debt holder. Pursuant to the agreement, the debt holder agreed to reduce the debt to Cdn$100,000 on the condition that the Company pays the amount of Cdn$2,500 per month for 40 months, beginning March 1, 2012 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter. 

F-10 

On July 18, 2012, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the $150,000 debenture holder. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the lender agreed to extend the due date until April 11, 2013 and the Company agreed to pay $43,890 of accrued interest within five days of the agreement (paid), pay the accruing interest on a monthly basis (paid), and pay a $10,000 premium in addition to the $150,000 principal outstanding on April 11, 2013. On April 29, 2013, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement whereby the lender agreed to extend the due date to September 15, 2013 and the Company agreed to pay $6,836 of interest for the period from April 1 to September 15, 2013 upon execution of the agreement (paid) and granted the lender 100,000 stock options exercisable at $0.12 per share for a period of two years. 
   
 On November 15, 2013, the Company entered into a second settlement agreement amendment. Pursuant to the second amendment, on November 15, 2013, the Company agreed to pay interest of $4,438 (paid) and commencing February 1, 2014, the Company would make monthly payments of $10,000 on the outstanding principal and interest. On December 4, 2015, the holder of the convertible debenture entered into an agreement to sell and assign the remaining outstanding principal to a third party.  The Company approved and is bound by the assignment and sale agreement. 
   
 The Company evaluated the modifications and determined that the creditor did not grant a concession. In addition, as the present value of the amended future cash flows had a difference of less than 10% of the cash flows of the original debt, it was determined that the original and new debt instruments are not substantially different. As a result, the modification was not treated as an extinguishment of the debt and no gain or loss was recognized because the fair value of the old debt and new debt remained the same. The Company recorded the fair value of $12,901 for the stock options as additional paid-in capital and a discount. During the year ended May 31, 2014, the Company repaid $40,000 of the debenture.  As at May 31, 2014 the Company had accreted $12,901 of the discount bring the carrying value of the convertible debenture to $114,661.  During the year ended May 31, 2015, the Company repaid $54,808 decreasing the carrying value to $59,853.  At August 31, 2016, the other remaining debenture of $59,853 remained outstanding and past due.

 On August 19, 2013, the Company issued a convertible debenture for total proceeds of $10,000, which bears interest at 10% per annum, is unsecured, and due two years from date of issuance. The unpaid amount of principal and accrued interest can be converted at the holder s option into shares of the Company s common stock at $0.04 per share at any time after the first anniversary of the notes.  The Company recognized the intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature of $10,000 as additional paid-in capital and reduced the carrying value of the convertible debenture to $nil. The carrying value will be accreted over the term of the convertible debenture up to its face value of $10,000. As at August 31, 2016, the carrying value of the convertible promissory note was $10,000 and the note remained outstanding and in default.

  Derivative Liabilities  
   
 The embedded conversion option of the convertible debenture described in Note 9(g) contains a conversion feature that qualifies for embedded derivative classification.  The fair value of the liability will be re-measured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be reported in the statement of operations as a gain or loss on derivative financial instruments.  
   
 Upon the issuance of the convertible note payable described in Note 9(g), the Company concluded that it only has sufficient shares to satisfy the conversion of some but not all of the outstanding convertible notes, warrants and options.  The Company elected to reclassify contracts from equity with the earliest inception date first. As a result, none of the Company s previously outstanding convertible instruments qualified for derivative reclassification, however, any convertible securities issued after the election, including the convertible note described in Notes 9(h), 9(i) and 9(j), and the rights described in Note 7(i) would qualify for treatment as derivative liabilities.  The Company reassesses the classification of the instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. 
   
 The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial liabilities: 

The Company uses Level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology for the embedded conversion option liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on various assumptions. The model incorporates the price of a share of the Company s common stock (as quoted on the Over the Counter Markets), volatility, risk free rate, dividend rate and estimated life. Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement. As required, these are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table shows the assumptions used in the calculations:

  Commitments and Contingencies  
  (a) 
 On September 2, 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with a company to acquire a worldwide, exclusive license for the Mixed Reactant Flow-By Fuel Cell technology. The term of the agreement is for twenty years or the expiry of the last patent licensed under the agreement, whichever is later. The Company agreed to pay the licensor the following license fees: 
    
 an initial license fee of Cdn$10,000 payable in two installments: Cdn$5,000 upon execution of the agreement (paid) and Cdn$5,000 within thirty days of September 2, 2009 (paid); 
    
 a further license fee of Cdn$15,000 (paid) to be paid within ninety days of September 2, 2009; and 
    
 an annual license fee, payable annually on the anniversary of the date of the agreement as follows: 

The Company is to pay the licensor a royalty calculated as 2% of the gross revenue and 15% of any and all consideration directly or indirectly received by the Company from the grant of any sublicense rights. The Company will pay interest at a rate of 1% per month on any amounts past due. In addition, the Company is responsible for the timely payment of all future costs relating to patent expenses and any new or useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter arising out of any licensor improvements or joint improvements licensed under this agreement and identified by the licensor as potentially patentable. The Company must also invest a minimum of Cdn$250,000 in research and development directly associated with the technology. 
  (b) 
 On May 23, 2012, a former employee of the Company delivered a Notice of Application seeking judgment against the Company for approximately $55,000. The hearing of that Application took place on July 31, 2012, at which time the former employee obtained judgment in the approximate amount of $55,000. The Company did not defend the amount of the judgment and the amount is included in accounts payable, but claims a complete set-off on the basis that the former employee retains 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company as security for payment of the outstanding consulting fees owed to him. On August 31, 2012, the Company commenced a separate action against the former employee seeking a return of the 1,000,000 shares of common stock and a stay of execution of the judgment. That application is pending and has not yet been heard or determined by the court. The payment of the judgment claim of approximately $55,000 is dependent upon whether the former employee will first return the 1,000,000 shares of common stock noted above. The probable outcome of the Company s claim for the return of the shares cannot yet be determined. 
  (c) 
 On November 15, 2013, the Company entered into a second settlement agreement with the $150,000 debenture holder described in Note 9(a). Pursuant to the second amendment, on November 15, 2013, the Company agreed to make monthly payments of $10,000 on the outstanding principal and interest.  Payments were made until December 2014, but have not been made after.  The plaintiff is seeking relief of amounts owed along with 10% interest per annum, from the date of judgments.  All amounts are recorded in these financial statements. 
  (d) 
 On September 3, 2015, a former prospective employee of the Company delivered a Notice of Claim seeking judgment against the Company for approximately $11,400.  The Company believes the claim is without merit and intends to defend itself.

  Description of Business  
   
 We were incorporated in Nevada on January 22, 2007. On December 8, 2008 we continued our corporate jurisdiction out of the state of Nevada and into the Province of British Columbia, Canada. Our principal offices are located at 1562 128th Street, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, V4A 3T7. Our telephone number is (604) 560-1503. Our fiscal year end is May 31. 
   
 Our business is to develop technologies that we hope to lead to commercially feasible products and services which are intended to mitigate negative environmental and health consequences that arise from the production of energy and the consumption of resources. 
   
 We plan to develop or acquire technologies and services that provide a carbon reduction in the environment. To carry out our business strategy we intend to acquire or license from third parties technologies that require further development before they can be brought to market. We also intend to develop such technologies ourselves, and we anticipate that to complete commercialization of some technologies we will enter into joint ventures, partnerships, or other strategic relationships with third parties who have expertise that we may require. We may spin out or divest of technologies from time to time as they mature to improve cash flow, or when they are mature enough to become a self sustaining business.  
   
 Through a partially owned subsidiary, have acquired and own a process for the electro-reduction of carbon dioxide ( ERC ) and have the exclusive world license for a mixed-reactant fuel cell ( MRFC ). We are developing these technologies toward commercial applications.  

3 

In the past we have contracted out our development work to various laboratories. During the year, we conducted research and development related work from time to time on these technologies at our offices and with own staff in Vancouver, B.C.  
   
 Our activities include: experimentation to improve the process performance; process and economic modeling to optimize the costs of a commercial system; design and simulation of pilot systems for technology demonstration and validation; business development activities such as the establishment of strategic and technology development partners; and the design and fabrication of laboratory prototypes, among others.  
   
 We currently carry out the majority of our business through our subsidiary, Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd. ( MEA ), through which we develop and research technologies related to alternative energy and chemical production to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption.  
   
 We also have a number of inactive subsidiaries, which we may engage in various businesses in the future but have no current plans to do so at this time. 
     
 Since our inception, we have incurred operational losses and we have completed several rounds of financing to fund our operations. Our partially owned subsidiary Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd. has itself undertaken financing activities to raise money for research and development by issuing common shares. Presently, MEA and the Company is seeking funding to develop a prototype unit for the MRFC technology.  
   
   Collaboration with Alstom (Switzerland) Ltd.   
   
 On June 24, 2013, we entered into an agreement with Alstom (Switzerland) Ltd. concerning the joint research and development projects relating to (1) a pilot plant for the conversion of carbon dioxide to formate at a Lafarge cement plant (the  Lafarge pilot project  and (2) the development of processes for the conversion of carbon dioxide to other valuable chemicals. 
   
 Pursuant to the agreement with Alstom, MEA and Alstom co-operated in one or more research and development projects related to MEA s ERC technology. Through this cooperation, the development of technologies and processes for the conversion of CO 2      to chemical products and the investigation of the feasibility of scale-up and commercialization of these processes occurred.  
   
 Each party will have exclusive right and discretion to prosecute all patents and patent applications resulting from its work on any project. The parties will jointly prosecute any intellectual property in jointly-owned results. Alstom will have the option under the agreement to acquire a license to use intellectual property created by MEA under the agreement, and to a license to MEA s ERC technology, as may be reasonably required to exploit intellectual property assumed by Alstom. The agreement does not affect ownership of any underlying intellectual property of either party. 
   
 The agreement with Alstom will remain valid for five years or the completion of the last active project, whichever last occurs, and may be extended at any time by the written agreement of both parties.  
   
   Electro Reduction of Carbon Dioxide ( ERC )    
   
 We previously acquired 100% ownership in and to a certain chemical process for the electro-reduction of carbon dioxide. The reactor at the core of the chemical process, referred to as the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2), or  ERC , has been proven functional through small-scale prototype trials and limited scale-up trials. ERC offers a possible solution to reduce the impact of CO2 emissions on Earth s environment by converting CO2 into chemicals with a broad range of commercial applications. These include a fuel for a next generation of fuel cells, and synthetic gas ( syngas ), which is a cornerstone intermediate in the chemical industry, and can be further upgraded to products such as diesel or jet fuel. Powered by electricity, the ERC process combines captured carbon dioxide with water to produce materials such as formate salts, syngas, oxalic acid and methanol, that are conventionally obtained from the thermo-chemical processing of fossil fuels. However, while thermo-chemical reactions must be driven at relatively high temperatures that are normally obtained by burning fossil fuels, ERC operates at near ambient conditions and is driven by electric energy that can be taken from an electric power grid supplied by hydro, wind, solar or nuclear energy. 
   
 Whereas ERC has been shown to produce a range of compounds, the efficiency for generation of each compound depends on the experimental conditions, and most importantly on the material of the cathode, which catalyzes the electrochemical reactions. 

4 

Until appropriate cathodes are found some products of CO2 reduction (methanol, for instance) are obtained at efficiencies too low for practical use. Other products can be generated on known cathodes with high current yields that could support valuable practical processes. For example, formate salts have been obtained on tin cathodes with current efficiencies above 80%, at industrially relevant conditions. Current efficiencies exceeding 80% have also been obtained on proprietary silver cathodes for carbon monoxide, the key constituent of syngas. 
   
   Established and Emerging Market for ERC and its Chemical Products   
   
 The technology behind ERC can be applied to any scale commercial venture which outputs CO2 into the atmosphere, though it is expected to be most effective when applied to large scale stationary sources. We anticipate that, once fully commercialized, we will be able to offer ERC as a CO2 management system to various industry including steel, cement, fermentation processes, power generation and pulp and paper. 
   
 As described, the ERC process can be used to produce a variety of different chemical products from CO2. The first products that Mantra are targeting are formic acid and its salts. These products have existing markets as commodity chemicals and sell for between $1,000 and $1,500 per tonne, with global consumption being in excess of 600,000 tonnes per year. Formic acid and its salts are used in a variety of industrial applications, including silage preservation, leather tanning, textiles production, oil well drilling, and de-icing, and show enormous potential for market expansion through their use in chemical energy storage. 
   
 However, if the ERC process reaches market acceptance as a way to deal with CO2 emissions from industry facilities, it will likely lead to supply of formic acid in excess of current market demand. We have identified several potential future applications for formic acid, which may lead to an expansion in current market demand. The application we have identified and are currently focusing on is energy storage. 
   
 On the other hand, the ERC process to syngas suffers from very few market limitations. The market for synthetic gas is currently estimated at around $ 36 billion, and growing. Due to the large number of products which can be produced from syngas, including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel or methanol, we anticipate the demand for an environmentally-conscious pathway to these chemicals will grow rapidly into the future. 
   
   Energy Storage   
   
 Formate salts and formic acid, which can be produced from CO 2      via ERC, are excellent energy carriers and effective fuels for the MRFC. Thus, the integration of ERC and MRFC represents an energy storage solution whereby intermittent renewable electricity can be stored as formate/formic acid when it is available, and liberated when it is needed. The availability of energy storage is widely recognized as the next most critical factor for increased renewables penetration.

For the three months ended August 31, 2016, we generated no revenues compared to revenues of $13,638 during the same period in 2015. Revenues decreased in 2016, our revenue-generating project ceased in prior periods.  
   
  Expenses  
   
 Our operating expenses for the three month periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 are summarized as follows: 

For the three months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred total operating expenses of $88,994, compared to total operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2015 of $327,566. The decrease is due to the following. A decrease in General and administrative expense for $66,924 which primarily related to reduced staff and overhead. Further, decrease of $87,122 in expenses related to consulting and advisory services occurred due to lesser activity. The reduction in research and development expenses for $43,017 was from reduced activity on our primary research projects. Also contributing to this decrease was a decrease of $25,240 in professional fees. 
   
  Net Loss  
   
 For the three months ended August 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $164,008, compared to a net loss of $$336,690 for the same period in 2015. 

7 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 As of August 31, 2016, our total current assets were $134,174 and our total current liabilities were $2,900,508, resulting in a working capital deficit of $2,894,056 compared to a working capital deficit of $2,832,673 as at May 31, 2016. 
   
 We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard we have historically raised additional capital through equity offerings and loan transactions. 
     
   Cash Flows   

The increase in cash that we experienced during the three months ended August 31, 2016 was insignificant. Our cash position is poor. The reduction of $127,957 in cash used for operations reflects decrease in operating activities for the period ending in 2016 compared with the same prior period in 2015. The reduction of $118,186 in cash provided by financing activities reflects the lesser amount of borrowing due to reduced operations and lack of profitability. We expect that our total expenses will increase over the next year as we increase our business operations, which is subject to raising additional funds, for which we currently have no commitments. We have not been able to reach the break-even point since our inception and have had to rely on outside capital resources. We do not anticipate making significant revenues for the next year. Over the next 12 months, subject to raising additional funds, we plan to primarily concentrate on commercializing our ERC technology and associated projects. 

In order to fully carry out our business plan and improve liquidity, we need additional financing of approximately $3,650,000 for future expenditures and $1,350,000 for the next 12 months, totaling $5,000,000. In order to improve our liquidity, we intend to pursue additional equity financing from private placement sales of our equity securities or shareholders  loans. We do not presently have sufficient financing to undertake our planned business activities. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. 
   
 We currently do not have any arrangements in place for the completion of any further private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further private placement financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our business activities and administrative expenses in order to be within the amount of capital resources that are available to us. 

8 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. 
   
  Inflation  
   
 The effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results has not been significant. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies  
   
             Our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. A complete summary of these policies can be found in the May 31, 2016 audited financials. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by management. 
   
  Basis of Presentation/Principles of Consolidation  
     
             These consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and our subsidiaries, Carbon Commodity Corporation, Climate ESCO Ltd., Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., Mantra China Inc., Mantra China Limited, Mantra Media Corp., Mantra NextGen Power Inc., and Mantra Wind Inc. All the subsidiaries are wholly-owned with the exception of Climate ESCO Ltd., which is 64.55% owned and Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd., which is 88.21% owned. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
   
  Use of Estimates  
   
             The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to allowance for doubtful accounts, the estimated useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets, valuation of inventory, equity component of convertible debt, stock-based compensation, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Our company bases our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by our company may differ materially and adversely from our company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 
   
  Accounts Receivable  
   
             Our company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts to ensure accounts receivable are not overstated due to the inability or unwillingness of its customers to make required payments. The allowance is based on historical bad debt expense, the age of receivable and the specific identification of receivables our company considers at risk. 
     
  Intangible Assets  
   
             Intangible assets consist of patents and are stated at cost and have a definite life. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Our company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the accounts. These assets are reviewed for impairment or obsolescence when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, intangible assets are written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques. Our company has no intangibles with indefinite lives. 

9 

Long-lived Assets  
   
             In accordance with ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment  , our company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value, which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. 
   
  Technology Development Revenue Recognition  
   
             Our company performs research and development services. Our company recognizes revenue under research contracts when a contract has been executed, the contract price is fixed and determinable, delivery of services or products has occurred, and collectability of the contract price is considered reasonably assured and can be reasonably estimated. Revenue is based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates plus other billable direct costs. 
   
  Research and Development Costs  
   
             Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
   
  Stock-based Compensation  
   
             Our company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. 
   
             Our company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. This model is affected by our company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to our company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period. 
   
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 We do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
   
  ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
   
 Not required under Regulation S-K for  smaller reporting companies.  

10 

ITEM 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
   
  a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  
   
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
   
 Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, as of August 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  The material weaknesses, which relate to internal control over financial reporting, that were identified are:  
   
 a) 
 Due to our small size, we do not have a proper segregation of duties in certain areas of our financial reporting process.  The areas where we have a lack of segregation of duties include cash receipts and disbursements, approval of purchases and approval of accounts payable invoices for payment. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis; 
   
 b) 
 We do not have a functioning audit committee.  As a result, there is ineffective independent oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and 
   
 c) 
 We do not have any formally adopted internal controls surrounding its cash and financial reporting procedures. 
   
 We are committed to improving our financial organization.  In addition, we will look to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function to resolve non-routine or complex accounting matters. In addition, when funds are available, we will take the following action to enhance our internal controls: Hiring additional knowledgeable personnel with technical accounting expertise to further support our current accounting personnel, which management estimates will cost approximately $100,000 per annum.  As our operations are relatively small and we continue to have net cash losses each quarter, we do not anticipate being able to hire additional internal personnel until such time as our operations are profitable on a cash basis or until our operations are large enough to justify the hiring of additional accounting personnel.  We currently engage an outside accounting firm to assist us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and anticipate doing so until we have a sufficient number of internal accounting personnel to achieve compliance. As necessary, we will engage consultants in the future in order to ensure proper accounting for our consolidated financial statements. 
   
 Due to the fact that our internal accounting staff consists solely of a Chief Executive Officer, who functions as our Principal Accounting Officer, additional personnel will also ensure the proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support us if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. We believe this will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues we may encounter in the future. 
   
  (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  
   
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended August 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
