              TYG SOLUTIONS CORP          NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       September 30, 2016              NOTE 1. GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS       TYG Solutions Corp ( the Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on March 25, 2013. The Company began limited operations on May 30, 2013.     The Company is engaged in mobile app development.        NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN       The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had negative working capital and negative cash flows from operating activities. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     Management is planning to raise funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.            NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRACTICES               Basis of Accounting        The Company s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a December 31 fiscal year end.     In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2016 and its results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended September 30, 2016. The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with instructions to Form 10-Q. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.        Use of Estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.        Cash and Cash Equivalents        The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.        Accounts Receivable        Credit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customer s financial condition. Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value. The Company utilizes a specific identification accounts receivable reserve methodology based on a review of outstanding balances and previous activities to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company charges off uncollectible receivables at the time the Company determines the receivable is no longer collectible. The Company does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk.               6  
                  Fair Value of Financial Instruments        The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:     Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     Level 2   Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.     Level 3   Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.     As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.        Revenue recognition          The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC No. 605-10-S99, (SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 104,  Revenue Recognition ), when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.     In situations with multiple deliverables, the Company recognizes revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when the Company receives customer acceptance or is otherwise released from its customer acceptance obligations. The Company allocates revenue consideration, based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting contained within an arrangement containing multiple deliverables. Relative selling prices are determined using vendor specific objective evidence, if it exists; otherwise third-party evidence or the Company s best estimate of selling price is used for each deliverable.        Income Taxes        A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.     When required, the Company records a liability for unrecognized tax positions, defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between positions taken on tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet this threshold. The Company has no uncertain tax positions that require the Company to record a liability. The federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to examination by the IRS, generally for three years after they are filed.     The Company recognizes penalties and interest associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and includes accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in the balance sheet. The Company had no accrued penalties and interest as of September 30, 2016.       7  
                  Earnings (Loss) per Share        The basic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our net income available to common shareholders by the number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing our net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of the first of the year for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. The Company has not issued any potentially dilutive debt or equity securities.        Recently issued accounting pronouncements        The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.       NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES       There is no current or deferred income tax expense or benefit allocated to continuing operations for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.     The Company uses the liability method , where deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, applying the statutory income tax rate the Company had deferred tax assets of approximately $10,572 and $10,234 related to net operating losses, respectively. A valuation allowance was recorded against the tax assets to reduce the carrying value to zero.     As of September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $31,095 which begin expiring in 2033.          NOTE 5. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY        The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock. All common stock shares have equal voting rights, are non-assessable and have one vote per share. Voting rights are not cumulative and, therefore, the holders of more than 50% of the common stock could, if they choose to do so, elect all of the directors of the Company.       NOTE 6. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST       The officers and directors of the Company are involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. If a specific business opportunity becomes available, such persons may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and their other business interests. The Company has not formulated a policy for the resolution of such conflicts.       NOTE 7   RELATED PARTY LOANS AND TRANSACTIONS       As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans from related parties amounted to $583 and $17,207, respectively. The loans represent working capital advances from an officer of the Company and are unsecured, non-interest bearing, and due on demand.       NOTE 8   CONCENTRATION RISKS       The Company generates revenues from three customers with costs of two subcontractors. It is considered at least reasonably possible that any customer or subcontractor will be lost in the near term.               8  
          ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION          FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS         Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.           GENERAL          Overview             TYG Solutions Corp. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 25, 2013.We develop iPhone and Android smartphone apps for companies who need an app for their internal and external operations.

On February 20, 2015 the Company entered into an Application Development Agreement with a client, whereby the client agreed to pay the Company to develop a Photo Viewer app. The total price we charged the client for our services was $15,000. The Company completed the apps and delivered the files to client. The client paid the company the full amount.

The total price we charged the client was $30,000. The client has paid a down payment of $20,000 and will pay an additional $10,000 following the three month support period. A copy of the Application Development Agreements is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.5.         On December 15, 2015 the Company entered into an Application Development Agreement with a client, whereby the client agreed to pay the Company to develop certain iPhone and Android applications. The total price we charged the client was $15,000. The client has paid a down payment of $5,000 and will pay an additional $10,000 once they are satisfied with the apps. . A copy of the Application Development Agreements is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.6.         We charge a flat fee of $5,000 as a base for any proposed app that we are asked to develop.  If, however, the app is a more sophisticated app then we may charge more depending on the complexity of the app.         We are currently a development stage company. We may require additional capital to implement our business and fund our operations. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis .         The Company s fiscal year end is December 31. The Company s principal executive office and mailing address is 202 Avenue F, Brooklyn, New York 11218. Our telephone number is 718-407-2059.               9  
          Target Market           We plan to target mid-size to large companies as app development is suitable for all types of companies that want to modernize their operations.           Marketing and Sales           At this early stage of our operation, our officers and directors are expected to handle all marketing and sales efforts. After our first year of operation, we hope to have generated enough revenue to develop a marketing campaign to promote and publicize our website and service.          We do not have any specific marketing channels in place at this point to be able to market our services to potential customers. But, in the next twelve months, we hope to attend conferences, advertise by word of mouth and possible reach out to local businesses to sell our services. We do expect that the biggest part of our marketing and sales strategy will be from word of mouth advertising. Referrals from people that were pleased with our level of service will be our most efficient form of marketing.          Competition          The app development industry is highly competitive because the barrier to entry is very low. Additionally, the market is very fragmented with many small companies competing against each other. We expect to be able to compete by providing responsive and knowledgeable consultants at reasonable prices.          Services Pricing          We anticipate that our fees would start at $5,000 for easier, simpler applications and get more expensive as detail and complexity increase. To date, we have entered into agreements with six (6) clients and have charged them each flat fees ranging from $7,500 to $90,000.          Employees          We presently have no employees apart from our officers and directors. Our officers and directors devote about 20 hours per week to our affairs.           10

Cash Flows from Financing Activities          Cash flows used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were ($16,624), consisting of repayments by the Company of a loan payable to a related party compared to ($3,391) cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.         PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING         We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of sales revenue and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.         Revenues, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.         OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS         As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.         GOING CONCERN         The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had negative working capital and negative cash flows from operating activities. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.     Management is planning to raise funds through debt or equity offerings. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts.                 12
