Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements            

          This Report on Form 10-Q contains various statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Rule 3b-6
promulgated thereunder and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans,
objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward- looking. These forward-looking statements often can be, but are not always, identified by the use
of words such as "assume," "expect," "intend," "plan," "project," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "anticipate," "may," "might," "should," "could," "goal," "potential" and similar expressions. We
base these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, our assumptions regarding these events and our knowledge of facts at the time the statements are
made. These statements include statements relating to our projected growth, anticipated future financial performance, and management's long-term performance goals, as well as statements relating to
the anticipated effects on results of operations and financial condition.   

          These
forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control and our actual results could differ materially from our projected results.
In addition, our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results. The forward-looking statements could be affected by many factors, including but not limited
to:  

local, regional, and national economic conditions and events and their impact on us and our customers;    
            changes in the financial performance or condition of the Company's customers;   
            volatility in credit and equity markets and its effect on the global economy;   
            competition for loans and deposits and failure to attract or retain deposits and loans;   
            our ability to increase market share and control expenses;   
            our ability to develop and promote customer acceptance of new products and services in a timely manner;    
            risks associated with concentrations in real estate related loans;   
            other than temporary impairment charges to our securities portfolio;   
            an oversupply of inventory and deterioration in values of California commercial real estate;   
            a prolonged slowdown in construction activity;   
            changes in the level of nonperforming assets and charge-offs and other credit quality measures, and their impact on the adequacy of the
Company's allowance for loan losses and the Company's provision for loan losses;   
            the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Open Market
Committee of the Federal Reserve Board;   
            changes in inflation, interest rates, and market liquidity which may impact interest margins and impact funding sources;    
            our ability to raise capital or incur debt on reasonable terms;   
            regulatory limits on Heritage Bank of Commerce's ability to pay dividends to the Company;   
            changes in our capital management policies, including those regarding business combinations, dividends, and share repurchases, among others;

Table of Contents   

operational issues stemming from, and/or capital spending necessitated by, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information
technology systems, on which we are highly dependent;   
            the ability to keep pace with, and implement on a timely basis, technological changes;   
            the impact of cyber security attacks or other disruptions to the Company's information systems and any resulting compromise of data or
disruptions in service;   
            changes in the competitive environment among financial or bank holding companies and other financial service providers;    
            the effect and uncertain impact on the Company of the enactment of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and
the rules and regulations promulgated by supervisory and oversight agencies implementing the new legislation;   
            significant changes in applicable laws and regulations, including those concerning taxes, banking and securities;    
            the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other accounting standard setters;   
            the costs and effects of legal and regulatory developments, including resolution of legal proceedings or regulatory or other governmental
inquiries, and the results of regulatory examinations or reviews;   
            the successful integration of the business, employees and operations of Focus Business Bank with the Company and our ability to achieve the
projected synergies of this acquisition within expected time frame; and   
            our success in managing the risks involved in the foregoing factors.    

We
are not able to predict all the factors that may affect future results. You should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statement, which speaks only as of the date of this
Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by applicable laws or regulations, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

HERITAGE COMMERCE CORP              NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS              September 30, 2016              (Unaudited)     

1) Basis of Presentation     

The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Heritage Commerce Corp (the "Company" or "HCC") and its wholly owned subsidiary, Heritage Bank of Commerce ("HBC"), have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") for annual financial statements are not included herein. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes that were included in the
Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

          The
Company acquired BVF/CSNK Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation ("BVF/CSNK") on November 1, 2014, the parent company of CSNK Working Capital Finance Corp. dba Bay View
Funding ("Bay View Funding"). BVF/CSNK was subsequently merged into Bay View Funding and Bay View Funding became a wholly owned subsidiary of HBC.   

The
Company acquired Focus Business Bank ("Focus") on August 20, 2015. Focus was merged with HBC, with HBC as the surviving bank. Focus's results of operations have been included
in the Company's results of operations beginning August 21, 2015.   

          HBC
is a commercial bank serving customers primarily located in Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Benito counties of California. Bay View Funding provides business-essential
working capital factoring financing to various industries throughout the United States. No customer accounts for more than 10 percent of revenue for HBC or the Company. With the acquisition of
Bay View Funding, the Company now has two reportable segments consisting of Banking and Factoring. The Company's management uses segment results in its operating and strategic planning.   

In
management's opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature. All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.   

          The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results
could differ significantly from these estimates.   

          The
results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any subsequent period or for the entire year ending
December 31, 2016.   

Reclassifications      

          Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have been made to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no
impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or net change in cash and cash equivalents.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards      

          In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,    Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period
Adjustment.    This update applies to all entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of
the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer
recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this update
require that the acquirer's record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the
change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this update require an entity to present separately on the face of the
income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to
the provisional amounts
had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company has evaluated the adoption of the new guidance and has determined it did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.   

Newly Issued, but not yet Effective Accounting Standards      

          In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,    Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Liabilities   . The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments by requiring: equity investments (other
than equity method or consolidation) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair
value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets (i.e. securities
or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at
amortized cost for organizations that are not public business entities; eliminating the requirement for non-public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to
estimate the fair value that is to be required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and requiring a reporting organization to present separately
in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in fair value of a liability resulting from the change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as "own credit") when the
organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for public business entities for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements, but it is not expected to have a
material impact.   

          In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,    Leases   . The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months.

    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)    

    September 30, 2016    

    (Unaudited)    

1) Basis of Presentation (Continued)    

  A
lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset
for the lease term. When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, a lessee (and a lessor) should include payments to be made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain
to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. Similarly, optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be included in the measurement of
lease assets and lease liabilities only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that purchase option.    Reasonably certain    is a
high threshold that is consistent with and intended to be applied in the same way as the    reasonably assured    threshold in the previous leases guidance.
In addition, also consistent with the previous leases guidance, a lessee (and a lessor) should exclude most variable lease payments in measuring lease assets and lease liabilities, other than those
that depend on an index or a rate or are in substance fixed payments. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of
underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.   

          In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,    Compensation Stock Compensation   :    Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   . The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax
impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be
recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An
entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. Excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax
cash flows as an operating activity. An entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for
forfeitures when they occur. The threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions. Cash paid by an employer when
directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. A nonpublic entity can make an accounting policy election to apply a practical expedient to
estimate the expected term for all awards with performance or service conditions that meet certain conditions. A nonpublic entity can make a one-time accounting policy election to switch from
measuring all liability-classified awards at fair value to intrinsic value. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15,
2016, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.   

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,    Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments   . The standard is the final guidance on the new current expected credit loss ("CECL") model. The amendments in this update replace the incurred loss
impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and

  requires
consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to estimate future credit loss estimates. As CECL encompasses all financial assets carried at amortized cost, the
requirement that reserves be established based on an organization's reasonable and supportable estimate of expected credit losses extends to held-to-maturity ("HTM") debt securities. The update amends
the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale securities ("AFS"), whereby credit losses
will be presented as an allowance as opposed to a write-down. In addition, CECL will modify the accounting for purchased loans with credit deterioration since origination, so that reserves are
established at the date of acquisition for purchased loans. Lastly, the amendment requires enhanced disclosures on the significant estimates and judgments used to estimate credit losses, as well as on
the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's portfolio. These disclosures require organizations to present the currently required credit quality disclosures disaggregated by the
year of origination or vintage. The guidance allows for a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to the balance sheet upon adoption (charge to retained earnings instead of
the income statement). The new guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption
is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.   

2) Shareholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share     

On September 12, 2016, the Company, entered into Exchange Agreements with Castle Creek Capital Partners IV, LP, Patriot Financial Partners, L.P. and Patriot
Financial Partners Parallel, L.P. (collectively "Preferred Stockholders") providing for the exchange of 21,003.75 shares of the Company's Series C convertible perpetual preferred stock,
no par value ("Series C Preferred Stock") for 5,601,000 shares of the Company's common stock, no par value. The exchange ratio was equal to the equivalent number of shares the Preferred
Stockholders would have received upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock.   

             Earnings Per Share     Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income, less dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock,
by
the weighted average common shares outstanding. The Series C Preferred Stock participated in the earnings of the Company prior to the exchange for common stock and, therefore, the shares issued
on the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock were considered outstanding under the two class method of computing basic earnings per common share during periods of earnings. Diluted
earnings per share reflect potential dilution

          Securities
with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in
a continuous unrealized loss position are as follows:   

There
were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its sponsored entities, in an amount greater than 10% of shareholders' equity. At
September 30, 2016, the Company held 460 securities (184 available-for-sale and 276 held-to-maturity), of which 22 had fair values below amortized cost. At September 30, 2016, there were
$2,227,000 of municipal bonds held-to-maturity, and $636,000 of agency mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity carried with an unrealized loss for 12 months or more. The total unrealized
loss for securities 12 months or more was $45,000 at September 30, 2016. The unrealized losses were due to higher interest rates. The issuers are of high credit quality and all principal
amounts are expected to be paid when securities mature. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date and/or market rates decline. The Company does not believe
that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery in value. The Company does not consider these securities to be
other than temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.

          At
December 31, 2015, the Company held 460 securities (193 available-for-sale and 267 held-to-maturity), of which 193 had fair values below amortized cost. At December 31,
2015, there were $2,165,000 of agency mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale, $4,409,000 of agency mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity and $24,412,000 of municipals bonds
held-to-maturity carried with an unrealized loss for 12 months or greater. The total unrealized loss for securities 12 months or greater was $910,000 at December 31, 2015. The
unrealized losses were due to higher interest rates. The issuers are of high credit quality and all principal amounts are expected to be paid when securities mature. The fair value is expected to
recover as the securities approach their maturity date and/or market rates decline. The Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security in
an unrealized loss position prior to recovery in value. The Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2015.

5) Loans (Continued)    

          Past
due loans 30 days or greater totaled $12,466,000 and $5,754,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, of which $2,190,000 and $591,000 were
on nonaccrual. At September 30, 2016, there were also $4,020,000 loans less than 30 days past due included in nonaccrual loans held-for-investment. At December 31, 2015, there
were also $4,125,000 loans less than 30 days past due included in nonaccrual loans held-for-investment. Management's classification of a loan as "nonaccrual" is an indication that there is
reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan. At that point, the Company stops accruing interest income, and reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued as
income. The Company begins recognizing interest income only as cash interest payments are received and it has been determined the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt. The loans may
or may not be collateralized, and collection efforts are pursued.   

Credit Quality Indicators      

          Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic
region, or have similar features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. The Company's loan portfolio is concentrated
in commercial (primarily manufacturing, wholesale, and service) and real estate lending, with the remaining balance in consumer loans. While no specific industry concentration is considered
significant, the Company's lending operations are located in the Company's market areas that are dependent on the technology and real estate industries and their supporting companies. Thus, the
Company's borrowers could be adversely impacted by a downturn in these sectors of the economy which could reduce the demand for loans and adversely impact the borrowers' ability to repay their loans.   

          The
Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical
payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This
analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. Nonclassified loans generally include those loans that are expected to be repaid in accordance with contractual loans terms. Classified loans are those
loans that are assigned a substandard, substandard-nonaccrual, or doubtful risk rating using the following definitions:   

            Substandard.       Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or
of the
collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the
institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.   

Substandard-Nonaccrual.       Loans classified as substandard-nonaccrual are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying
capacity of the
obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any, and it is probable that the Company will not receive payment of the full contractual principal and interest. Loans so classified have a well-defined
weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the

5) Loans (Continued)    

  deficiencies
are not corrected. In addition, the Company no longer accrues interest on the loan because of the underlying weaknesses.   

            Doubtful.       Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added
characteristic that the
weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.   

Loss.       Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectable or of so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted.
This
classification does not necessarily mean that a loan has no recovery or salvage value; but rather, there is much doubt about whether, how much, or when the recovery would occur. Loans classified as
loss are immediately charged off against the allowance for loan losses. Therefore, there is no balance to report at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

The
following table provides a summary of the loan portfolio by loan type and credit quality classification at period end:   

In
order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its
debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed in accordance with the Company's underwriting policy.   

          The
balance of troubled debt restructurings at September 30, 2016 was $140,000, which included $3,000 of nonaccrual loans and $137,000 of accruing loans. The balance of troubled
debt restructurings at December 31, 2015 was $153,000, which included $4,000 of nonaccrual loans and $149,000 of accruing loans. Approximately $2,000 and $3,000 in specific reserves were
established with respect to these loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no
additional amounts committed on any loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring.   

          There
were no new loans modified as troubled debt restructurings during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

5) Loans (Continued)     

A loan is considered to be in payment default when it is 30 days contractually past due under the modified terms. There were no defaults on troubled debt restructurings, within
twelve months following the modification, during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   

A
loan that is a troubled debt restructuring on nonaccrual status may return to accruing status after a period of at least six months of consecutive payments in accordance with the
modified terms.   

6) Business Combinations     

Focus Business Bank      

          On April 23, 2015, the Company and Focus entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger and reorganization whereby Focus would
merge into HBC. The Company completed the merger of its wholly-owned bank subsidiary HBC with Focus on August 20, 2015 for an aggregate transaction value of $66,558,000. Shareholders of Focus
received a fixed exchange ratio at closing of 1.8235 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of Focus common stock. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company issued 5,456,713 shares of
the Company's common stock to Focus shareholders for a total value of $58,278,000, based on the Company's closing stock price of $10.68 on August 20, 2015. In addition, the Company paid cash to
the Focus holders of in-the-money stock options on August 20, 2015 totaling $8,280,000.   

          Focus's
results of operations have been included in the Company's results of operations beginning August 21, 2015. Pre-tax severance, retention, acquisition and integration costs
totaled $2,865,000 for the third quarter of 2015, $3,407,000 for the first nine months of 2015, and $6,398,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.   

          The
following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.

          The
fair value of net assets acquired includes fair value adjustments to certain receivables of which some were considered impaired and some were not considered impaired as of the
acquisition date. The fair value adjustments were determined using discounted contractual cash flows, adjusted for expected losses and prepayments, where appropriate. The gross contractual amount of
four purchased credit impaired loans as of the acquisition date totaled $1,124,000. As of that date, contractual cash flows not expected to be collected on the purchased credit impaired loans totaled
$819,000, which represents 72.9% of their gross outstanding principal balances. The receivables that were not considered impaired at the acquisition date were not subject to the guidance relating to
purchased credit impaired loans,
which have shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination. Receivables acquired that were not subject to these requirements include nonimpaired loans with a fair value and gross contractual
amounts receivable of $170,048,000 and $174,660,000 respectively, on the date of acquisition. As of the acquisition date, the purchase discount on these nonimpaired loans totaled $4,612,000, which
represents 2.6% of their gross outstanding principal balances.   

          Goodwill
of $32,620,000 arising from the acquisition is largely attributable to synergies and cost savings resulting from combining the operations of the companies. As this transaction
was structured as a taxfree exchange, the goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment during the first twelve
months after the acquisition date if additional information becomes available to indicate a more accurate or appropriate value for an asset or liability.   

          The
following table summarizes the consideration paid for Focus:   

The
following table presents pro forma financial information as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015, which includes the pre-acquisition period for Focus. The
historical unaudited pro forma financial information has been adjusted to reflect supportable items that are directly attributable to the acquisition and expected to have a continuing impact on
consolidated results of operations, as such, one-time acquisition costs are not included. The unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro

The preparation of the unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial statements and related adjustments required management to make certain assumptions and estimates.   

(7) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets     

Goodwill      

At September 30, 2016, the carrying value of goodwill was $45,664,000, which included $13,044,000 of goodwill related to its acquisition
of Bay View Funding and $32,620,000 from its acquisition of Focus. During the fourth quarter of 2015, adjustments were made to the purchase price allocations for the Focus transaction that affected
the amounts allocated to goodwill and other assets.   

          Goodwill
impairment exists when a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, which is determined through a qualitative assessment whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of equity of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value ("Step Zero"). If the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of equity of a reporting
unit is less than book value, than a quantitative two-step impairment test is required. Step 1 includes the determination of the carrying value of the Company's single reporting unit, including the
existing goodwill and intangible assets, and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company is required to perform a
second step to the impairment test. Step 2 requires that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the
reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.   

The
Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of November 30. Goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances
change between annual tests that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company completed its annual impairment analysis on goodwill as of
November 30, 2015
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm. Based on the qualitative analysis performed, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit

its reported book value of equity at November 30, 2015. As such, no impairment was indicated and no further testing was required.   

Other Intangible Assets      

Core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets acquired in the June 2007 acquisition of Diablo Valley Bank were $5,049,000 and
$276,000, respectively. The core deposit intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life of 10 years. The customer relationship intangible asset was amortized over its estimated
useful life of seven years and was fully amortized at December 31, 2014. Accumulated amortization of these intangible assets was $5,024,000 and $4,703,000 at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.   

          The
core deposit intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of Focus in August 2015 was $6,285,000. This asset is amortized over its estimated useful life of 10 years.
Accumulated amortization of this intangible asset was $912,000 and $288,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.   

Other
intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Bay View Funding in November 2014 included: a below market value lease intangible asset of $109,000 (amortized over
3 years), customer relationship and brokered relationship intangible assets of $1,900,000, (amortized over the 10 year estimated useful lives), and a non-compete agreement intangible
asset of $250,000 (amortized over 3 years). Accumulated amortization of these intangible assets was $592,000 and $360,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.

Impairment
testing of the intangible assets is performed at the individual asset level. Impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair
value at the date of the impairment test. For intangible assets, estimates of expected future cash flows (cash inflows less cash outflows) that are directly associated with an intangible asset are
used to determine the fair value of that asset. Management makes certain estimates and assumptions in determining the expected future

flows from core deposit and customer relationship intangibles including account attrition, expected lives, discount rates, interest rates, servicing costs and other factors. Significant changes
in these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact the valuation of these intangible assets. If an impairment loss exists, the carrying amount of the intangible asset is adjusted to a new cost
basis. The new cost basis is then amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset. Based on its assessment, management concluded that there was no impairment of intangible assets at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   

8) Income Taxes     

Some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles, leading to timing differences between the
Company's
actual current tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income. These temporary differences comprise the "deferred" portion of the Company's tax expense or benefit, which
is accumulated on the Company's books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse.   

          Under
generally accepted accounting principles, a valuation allowance is required if it is "more likely than not" that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination of the
realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future
income, cumulative losses, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740-10
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, the Company estimated the need for a reserve for income taxes of $2,000, net of Federal benefit, for uncertain state income tax positions of Bay View
Funding as of September 30, 2016. The Company does not expect this amount to significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months.   

          The
Company had net deferred tax assets of $20,320,000, and $22,218,000, at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. After consideration of the matters in
the preceding paragraph, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 will be fully realized in
future years.   

          The
following table reflects the carry amounts of the low income housing investments included in accrued interest receivable and other assets, and the future commitments included in
accrued interest payable and other liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:   

The
Company expects $283,000 of the future commitments to be paid in 2016, $14,000 in 2017, and $83,000 in 2018 through 2023.

          For
tax purposes, the Company had low income housing tax credits of $111,000 and $180,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively, and low income housing investment losses of $118,000 and $217,000, respectively. For tax purposes, the Company had low income housing tax credits of $333,000 and $540,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively, and low income housing investment losses of $353,000 and $651,000, respectively. The Company recognized low income
housing investment expense as a component of income tax expense.   

9) Benefit Plans     

Supplemental Retirement Plan      

          The Company has a supplemental retirement plan (the "Plan") covering some current and some former key employees and directors. The Plan is a
nonqualified defined benefit plan. Benefits are unsecured as there are no Plan assets. The following table presents the amount of periodic cost recognized for the periods indicated:

10) Fair Value     

Accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:   

Level 1:
Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.   

          Level 2:
Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data (for example, interest rates and yield curves
observable at commonly quoted intervals, prepayment speeds, credit risks, and default rates).   

Level 3:
Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability.   

Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis      

          The fair values of securities available-for sale-are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges
(Level 1 inputs) or matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively
on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs).

10) Fair Value (Continued)     

The fair value of interest-only ("I/O") strip receivable assets is based on a valuation model used by a third party. The Company is able to compare the valuation model inputs and results
to widely available published industry data for reasonableness (Level 2 inputs).   

There
were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the period for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   

Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis      

          The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals.
The appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the
appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the
inputs for determining fair value.   

          Foreclosed
assets are valued at the time the loan is foreclosed upon and the asset is transferred to foreclosed assets. The fair value is based primarily on third party appraisals, less
costs to sell. The appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including the comparable sales and income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal
process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such

          The
following table shows the detail of the impaired loans held-for-investment and the impaired loans held-for-investment carried at fair value for the periods indicated:   

Impaired
loans held-for-investment which are measured primarily for impairment using the fair value of the collateral were $4,633,000 at September 30, 2016. In addition, these
loans had a specific valuation allowance of $1,668,000 at September 30, 2016. Impaired loans held-for-investment totaling $2,499,000 at September 30, 2016, were carried at fair value as
a result of the aforementioned partial charge-offs and specific valuation allowances at period-end. The remaining $2,134,000 of impaired loans were carried at cost at September 30, 2016, as the
fair value of the collateral exceeded the cost basis of each respective loan. Partial charge-offs and changes in specific valuation allowances during the first nine months of 2016 on impaired loans
held-for-investment carried at fair value at September 30, 2016 resulted in an additional provision for loan losses of $1,628,000.   

          At
September 30, 2016, foreclosed assets had a carrying amount of $292,000, with no valuation allowance at September 30, 2016.   

          Impaired
loans held-for-investment were $6,527,000 at December 31, 2015. There were no partial charge-offs at December 31, 2015. In addition, these loans had a specific
valuation allowance of $286,000 at December 31, 2015. Impaired loans held-for-investment totaling $2,988,000 at December 31, 2015 were carried at fair value as a result of the
aforementioned partial charge-offs and specific valuation allowances at year-end. The remaining $3,539,000 of impaired loans were carried at cost at December 31, 2015, as the fair value of the
collateral exceeded the cost basis of each respective loan. Partial charge-offs and changes in specific valuation allowances during 2015 on impaired loans held-for-investment carried at fair value at
December 31, 2015 resulted in an additional provision for loan losses of $156,000.

The
Company obtains third party appraisals on its impaired loans held-for-investment and foreclosed assets to determine fair value. Generally, the third party appraisals apply the
"market approach," which is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable (that is, similar) assets,
liabilities, or a group of

          The
carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments at December 31, 2015:   

The
methods and assumptions, not previously discussed, used to estimate the fair value are described as follows:   

Cash and Cash Equivalents      

          The carrying amounts of cash on hand, noninterest and interest-bearing due from bank accounts, and Fed funds sold approximate fair values and
are classified as Level 1.   

Loans      

          The fair value of loans held-for-sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third parties resulting in a Level 2
classification.   

          Fair
values of loans, excluding loans held-for-sale, are estimated as follows: For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values
are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. Impaired loans are valued at
the lower of

10) Fair Value (Continued)    

  cost
or fair value as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate the fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price.   

FHLB and FRB Stock      

          It was not practical to determine the fair value of FHLB and FRB stock due to restrictions placed on their transferability.   

Accrued Interest Receivable/Payable      

          The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value resulting in a Level 2 or Level 3 classification.   

Deposits      

          The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and noninterest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money
market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 2 classification. The carrying amounts
of variable rate, fixed-term money market accounts approximate their fair values at the reporting date resulting in a Level 2 classification. The carrying amounts of variable rate, certificates
of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date resulting in a Level 2 classification. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted
cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2
classification.   

Short-term Borrowings      

          The carrying amount approximates the fair value of short-term borrowings that reprice frequently and fully.   

Off-balance Sheet Instruments      

          Fair values for off-balance sheet, credit-related financial instruments are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements,
taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. The fair value of commitments is not material.   

Limitations      

          Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instruments. These estimates
do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Fair value estimates are based on judgments
regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

11) Equity Plan     

The Company maintained an Amended and Restated 2004 Equity Plan (the "2004 Plan") for directors, officers, and key employees. The 2004 Plan was terminated on May 23, 2013. On
May 23, 2013, the Company's shareholders approved the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2013 Plan"). The equity plans provide for the grant of incentive and nonqualified stock options and
restricted stock. The equity plans provide that the option price for both incentive and nonqualified stock options will be determined by the Board of Directors at no less than the fair value at the
date of grant. Options granted vest on a schedule determined by the Board of Directors at the time of grant. Generally options vest over four years. All options expire no later than ten years from the
date of grant. Restricted stock is subject to time vesting. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted 300,500 shares of nonqualified stock options and 85,024 shares of
restricted stock. There were 597,009 shares available for the issuance of equity awards under the 2013 Plan as of September 30, 2016.   

          Stock
option activity under the equity plans is as follows:   

As
of September 30, 2016, there was $1,627,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the equity plans. That cost is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.70 years.   

          Restricted
stock activity under the equity plans is as follows:

          As
of September 30, 2016, there was $1,742,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards granted under the equity plans. The cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.69 years.   

12) Capital Requirements     

The Company and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by the banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators
that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements and operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action, the Company and HBC must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory
accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.   

          As
of January 1, 2015, HCC and HBC along with other community banking organizations became subject to new capital requirements. The implementation of the capital conservation
buffer began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on
January 1, 2019). The Federal Banking regulators approved the new rules to implement the revised capital adequacy standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel
III, and address relevant provisions of The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended. The Company's consolidated capital ratios and the Bank's capital ratios
exceeded the regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized financial institution under the Basel III regulatory requirements at September 30, 2016.   

          Quantitative
measures established by regulation to help ensure capital adequacy require the Company and HBC to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the tables below) of
total, Tier 1 capital, and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined).
Management believes that, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company and HBC met all capital adequacy guidelines to which they were subject.

  (i) the
bank's retained earnings; or (ii) the bank's net income for its last three fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made by the bank to its shareholders during such
period. However, a bank, with the prior approval of the Commissioner of the California Department of Business Oversight Division of Financial Institutions ("DBO") may make a distribution
to its shareholders of an amount not to exceed the greater of (i) a bank's retained earnings; (ii) its net income for its last fiscal year; or (iii) its net income for the current
fiscal year. Also with the prior approval of the Commissioner of the DBO and the shareholders of the bank, the bank may make a distribution to its shareholders, as a reduction in capital of the bank.
In the event that the Commissioner determines that the shareholders' equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by a bank would be unsafe or unsound, the Commissioner may
order a bank to refrain from making such a proposed distribution. As of September 30, 2016, HBC would not be required to obtain regulatory approval, and the amount available for cash dividends
is $8,361,000. Similar restrictions applied to the amount and sum of loan advances and other transfers of funds from HBC to the parent company. During the third, second and first quarters of 2016, HBC
distributed dividends of $4,000,000, $4,000,000 and $6,000,000, respectively, for a total of $14,000,000 during the first nine months of 2016.   

13) Loss Contingencies     

The Company's policy is to accrue for legal costs associated with both asserted and unasserted claims when it is probable that such costs will be incurred and such costs can be
reasonably estimated. A number of parties have filed complaints in the Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara asserting certain claims against the Company arising from the transfer
of funds. The complaints have been consolidated for trial, which is set for trial in early 2017. The Company has reached a tentative settlement on two of the complaints, which is not considered to be
material. As to all claims, it is not possible to determine the amount of the loss, if any, arising from the claim in excess of the legal expenses expected to be incurred in defense of the litigation.
The Company intends to vigorously defend the litigation.

15) Business Segment Information     

The following presents the Company's operating segments. The Company operates through two business segments: Banking segment and Factoring segment. Transactions between segments consist
primarily of borrowed funds. Intersegment interest expense is allocated to the Factoring segment based on the Company's prime rate and funding costs. The provision for loan loss is allocated based on
the segment's allowance for loan loss determination which considers the effects of charge-offs. Noninterest income and expense directly attributable to a segment are assigned to it. Taxes are paid on

Bay View Funding Acquisition      

          On November 1, 2014, the Company acquired Bay View Funding, by purchasing all of the outstanding common stock from the stockholders of
Bay View Funding for an aggregate purchase price   

  54  

Table of Contents   

  of
$22.52 million. Bay View Funding became a wholly owned subsidiary of HBC. Based in Santa Clara, California, Bay View Funding provides business-essential working capital factoring financing
to various industries throughout the United States. The following table reflects selected financial information for Bay View Funding at or for the periods indicated:   

Focus Business Bank Merger      

          On August 20, 2015 ("acquisition date"), the Company completed the merger of HBC with Focus Business Bank ("Focus") for an aggregate
transaction value of $66.6 million. Shareholders of Focus received a fixed exchange ratio at closing of 1.8235 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of Focus common stock. The
Company issued 5,456,713 shares of the Company's common stock to Focus shareholders for a total value of $58.3 million based on the Company's closing stock price of $10.68 on August 20,
2015. In addition, the Company paid cash to the Focus holders of in-the-money stock options totaling $8.3 million.   

          The
Focus acquisition added total (at fair market value) assets of approximately $438.8 million, loans of approximately $174.8 million (including loans held-for-sale), and
deposits of approximately $405.1 million at August 20, 2015. Focus's results of operations were included in the Company's results of operations beginning August 21, 2015.   

Third Quarter 2016 Highlights      

          The following are major factors that impacted the Company's results of operations:  

The fully tax equivalent ("FTE") net interest margin contracted 29 basis points to 4.10% for the third quarter of 2016, from 4.39% for the
third quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower yields on loans and securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net interest margin declined 35 basis points to 4.19%, from 4.54%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to higher average balances of lower yielding funds at the Federal Reserve Bank and lower yields on loans and securities, which was
partially offset by an increase in the accretion of the loan purchase discount from the Focus transaction.   
            The accretion of the loan purchase discount into loan interest income from the Focus transaction was $299,000 for the third quarter of 2016,
and $262,000 for the third quarter of 2015. The accretion of the loan purchase discount in loan interest income from the Focus transaction was $1.1 million for the first nine months of 2016,
compared to $262,000 for the first nine months of 2015. The total purchase discount on non-impaired loans from the Focus loan portfolio was $4.6 million as of the acquisition date, of which
$2.5 million has been accreted into loan interest income from the acquisition date through September 30, 2016.   
            The yield on the loan portfolio was 5.60% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 5.70% for the third quarter of 2015. The yield on the loan
portfolio was 5.61% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 5.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio for the
third quarter and first nine months of 2016, compared to the respective periods in 2015, primarily reflects the addition of the lower yielding    
 
  55

Focus
loan portfolio and growth in the Company's legacy portfolio, partially offset by the accretion of the loan purchase discount from the Focus transaction.   

Net interest income increased 17% to $23.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $19.7 million for the third quarter
of 2015. Net interest income increased 26% to $68.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $54.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. Net interest income increased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, compared to the respective periods in 2015, primarily due to organic growth in the loan portfolio, the
accretion of the loan purchase discount from the Focus transaction, and an increase in the average balance of investment securities.   
            There was a $245,000 provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2016, compared to a $301,000 credit provision for loan losses for the
third quarter of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was a $997,000 provision for loan losses compared to a $339,000 credit provision for loan losses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.   
            Noninterest income increased to $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $2.1 million for the third quarter of
2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income was $8.6 million, compared to $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
in noninterest income for the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015, was primarily due to a $1.0 million gain on proceeds from company owned life insurance and
higher gains on sales of securities.   
            Total noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $14.3 million, compared to $16.4 million for the third quarter of
2015. The decrease in noninterest expense in the third quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2015, was primarily due to pre-tax acquisition, severance and retention costs incurred by the Company
related to the Focus transaction totaling $2.9 million for the third quarter of 2015. Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $43.4 million,
compared to $41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to additional employees retained from Focus and an increase in amortization of the core deposit
intangible assets as a result of the Focus acquisition, annual salary increases, newly hired employees and higher professional fees, partially offset by $3.4 million of pre-tax acquisition,
severance and retention costs incurred by the Company for the first nine months of 2015.   
            The efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2016 was 56.37%, compared to 75.49% for the third quarter of 2015. The efficiency ratio for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 56.55%, compared to 68.47% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The higher efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 2015 and nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to the Focus acquisition, severance and retention costs. Excluding the Focus acquisition, severance and retention costs, the efficiency ratio was
62.32% for the third quarter of 2015, and 62.76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
            Income tax expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $4.1 million, compared to $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2015. The
effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 37.5%, compared to 38.6% for the third quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 was higher primarily due to the impact
of non-deductible merger related expenses. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12.1 million, compared to $7.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 37.6%, compared to 37.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    
            The return on average tangible assets was 1.13%, and the return on average tangible equity was 13.06%, for the third quarter of 2016, compared
to 0.71% and 7.46%, respectively, for the third

quarter
of 2015. The return on average tangible assets was 1.16%, and the return on average tangible equity was 13.45%, for the first nine months of 2016, compared to 0.93% and 9.22%, respectively,
for the first nine months of 2015.   

The
following are important factors in understanding our current financial condition and liquidity position:  

Cash, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions and securities available-for-sale increased 10% to $714.4 million at
September 30, 2016, from $650.3 million at September 30, 2015, and decreased 2% from $729.2 million at December 31, 2015.   
            At September 30, 2016, investment securities held-to-maturity totaled $202.4 million, compared to $111.0 million at
September 30, 2015, and $109.3 million at December 31, 2015.   
            Loans (excluding loans held-for-sale) increased $117.8 million, or 9%, to $1.45 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to
$1.33 billion at September 30, 2015, which included an increase of $68.5 million, or 5% in the Company's legacy portfolio, and $49.3 million of purchased residential
mortgage loans at September 30, 2016. Loans increased $91.5 million, or 7%, at September 30, 2016, compared to $1.36 billion at December 30, 2015.    
            During the second and third quarters of 2016, the Company purchased jumbo single family residential mortgage loans totaling
$51.6 million, all of which are domiciled in California. The average loan principal amount is approximately $834,000, and the weighted average yield on the portfolio is 3.00%, net of servicing
fees to the servicer. Residential mortgages outstanding at September 30, 2016 totaled $49.3 million.   
            Nonperforming assets were $4.8 million, or 0.19% of total assets, at September 30, 2016, compared to $5.9 million, or
0.26% of total assets, at September 30, 2015, and $6.7 million, or 0.29% of total assets, at December 31, 2015.   
            Classified assets were $18.7 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $18.0 million at September 30, 2015, and
$19.0 million at December 31, 2015.   
            Net charge-offs totaled $134,000 for the third quarter of 2016, compared to net recoveries of $281,000 for the third quarter 2015, and net
charge-offs of $182,000 for the fourth quarter of 2015.   
            The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 was $20.0 million, or 1.38% of total loans, representing 445.55% of
nonperforming loans. The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2015 was $18.7 million, or 1.41% of total loans, representing 340.49% of nonperforming loans. The allowance for loan
losses at December 31, 2015 was $18.9 million, or 1.39% of total loans, representing 296.74% of nonperforming loans.   
            Total deposits increased $256.6 million, or 13%, to $2.22 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $1.96 billion
at September 30, 2015, and increased $155.9 million, or 8%, from $2.06 billion at December 31, 2015. Deposits excluding all time deposits and CDARS deposits increased
$291.2 million, or 17%, to $1.98 billion at September 30, 2016, from $1.69 billion at September 30, 2015, and increased $166.2 million, or 9%, from
$1.81 billion at December 31, 2015.   
            The ratio of noncore funding (which consists of time deposits of $250,000 and over, CDARS deposits, brokered deposits, securities under
agreement to repurchase and short-term borrowings) to total assets was 7.13% at September 30, 2016, compared to 9.19% at September 30, 2015, and 8.01% at December 31, 2015.    
            The loan to deposit ratio was 65.36% at September 30, 2016, compared to 67.91% at September 30, 2015, and 65.87% at
December 31, 2015.

The Company's consolidated capital ratios exceeded regulatory guidelines and the Bank's capital ratios exceeded the regulatory guidelines for a
well-capitalized financial institution under the Basel III regulatory requirements at September 30, 2016.    

(1)    Requirements
for both HCC and HBC include a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, except the leverage ratio.    

Deposits      

          The composition and cost of the Company's deposit base are important in analyzing the Company's net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity
characteristics. Except for brokered time deposits, the Company's depositors are generally located in its primary market area. Depending on loan demand and other funding requirements, the Company also
obtains deposits from wholesale sources including deposit brokers. HBC is a member of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ("CDARS") program. The CDARS program allows customers with
deposits in excess of FDIC insured limits to obtain coverage on time deposits through a network of banks within the CDARS program. Deposits gathered through this program are considered brokered
deposits under regulatory guidelines. The Company has a policy to monitor all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help assure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due
to concentrations.   

          Total
deposits increased $256.6 million, or 13%, to $2.22 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $1.96 billion at September 30, 2015, and increased
$155.9 million, or 8%, from $2.06 billion at December 31, 2015. Deposits excluding all time deposits and CDARS deposits increased $291.2 million, or 17%, to
$1.98 billion at September 30, 2016, from $1.69 billion at September 30, 2015, and increased $166.2 million, or 9%, from $1.81 billion at December 31,
2015.   

          The
Company had $3.0 million in brokered deposits at September 30, 2016, compared to $24.2 million at September 30, 2015 and $17.8 million at
December 31, 2015. Deposits from title insurance companies,
escrow accounts and real estate exchange facilitators were $54.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $24.6 million at September 30, 2015, and $49.1 million at
December 31, 2015. Certificates of deposit from the State of California totaled $85.1 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $98.0 million at September 30, 2015
and $78.0 million at December 31, 2015.   

Liquidity      

          Our liquidity position refers to our ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments
in a timely fashion. At September 30, 2016, we had $344.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $557.3 million in available borrowing capacity from various
sources including the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB"), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ("FRB"), Federal funds facilities with several financial institutions, and line of credit with a
correspondent bank. The Company also had $438.3 million at fair value in unpledged

  securities
available at September 30, 2016. Our loan to deposit ratio was 63.36% at September 30, 2016, compared to 67.91% at September 30, 2015, and 65.87% at December 31,
2015.   

Lending      

          Our lending business originates principally through our branch offices located in our primary markets. In addition, Bay View Funding provides
factoring financing throughout the United States. Total loans, excluding loans-held-for sale, increased $117.8 million, or 9%, to $1.45 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to
$1.33 billion at September 30, 2015, which included an increase of $68.5 million, or 5%, in the Company's legacy loan portfolio, and $49.3 million of purchased residential
mortgage loans. Loans increased $91.5 million, or 7%, at September 30, 2016, compared to $1.36 billion at December 31, 2015, which included an increase of
$42.2 million, or 3%, in the Company's legacy portfolio, and $49.3 million of purchased residential real estate loans. The loan portfolio remains well-diversified with commercial and
industrial ("C I") loans accounting for 42% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2016, which included $47.8 million of factored receivables at Bay View Funding. Commercial real estate
loans accounted for 42% of the total loan portfolio, of which 43% were owner-occupied by businesses. Consumer and home equity loans accounted for 7% of total loans, land and construction loans
accounted for 6% of total loans, and residential mortgage loans accounted for the remaining 3% of total loans at September 30, 2016.   

          During
the second and third quarters of 2016, the Company purchased jumbo single family residential mortgage loans totaling $51.6 million, all of which are domiciled in
California. The average loan principal amount is approximately $834,000, and the weighted average yield on the portfolio is 3.00%, net of servicing fees to the servicer. Residential mortgages
outstanding at September 30, 2016 totaled $49.3 million.   

Net Interest Income      

          The management of interest income and expense is fundamental to the performance of the Company. Net interest income, the difference between
interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of the Company's total revenue. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest
income divided by average earning assets). Net interest income increased 17% to $23.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $19.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. Net
interest income increased 26% to $68.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $54.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase in the net interest income for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016, compared to the respective periods in 2015, was primarily due to organic growth in the loan portfolio, the
accretion of the loan portfolio purchase discount from the Focus transaction, and an increase in the average balance of investment securities.   

          The
Company through its asset and liability policies and practices seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the Company to an excessive level of interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. This is discussed in more detail under     "Liquidity and Asset/Liability
Management."    In addition, we believe there are measures and initiatives we can take to improve the net interest margin,
including increasing loan rates, adding floors on floating rate loans, reducing nonperforming assets, managing deposit interest rates, and reducing higher cost deposits.   

          The
net interest margin is also adversely impacted by the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and the reinvestment of loan payoffs into lower yielding investment securities and
other short-term investments.

Management of Credit Risk      

          We continue to proactively identify, quantify, and manage our problem loans. Early identification of problem loans and potential future losses
helps enable us to resolve credit issues with potentially less risk and ultimate losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred
losses in the portfolio. While we strive to carefully manage and monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating, circumstances can change at any time for loans included in the
portfolio that may result in future losses, that as of the date of the financial statements have not yet been identified as potential problem loans. Through established credit practices, we adjust the
allowance for loan losses accordingly. However, because future events are uncertain, there may be loans that will deteriorate, some of which could occur in an accelerated time-frame. As a result,
future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary. Because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial loans, commercial real estate, construction and land development loans
with relatively large balances, deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses. Future additions to the allowance
may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers. Additionally, Federal and state banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically
review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours.
Any increase in the allowance for loan losses would have an adverse effect, which may be material, on our financial condition and results of operation.   

          Further
discussion of the management of credit risk appears under    "Provision for Loan Losses"    and    "Allowance for
Loan Losses."   

Noninterest Income      

          While net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues, noninterest income is an important component. A portion of the
Company's noninterest income is associated with its SBA lending activity, consisting of gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing
retained. Other sources of noninterest income include loan servicing fees, service charges and fees, cash surrender value from company owned life insurance policies, and gains on the sale of
securities.   

Noninterest Expense      

          Management considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the Company's performance. Noninterest expense for the third
quarter of 2016 was $14.3 million, compared to $16.4 million for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third
quarter of 2015, was primarily due to pre-tax acquisition, severance and retention costs incurred by the Company related to the Focus transaction totaling $2.9 million for the third quarter of
2015. Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $43.4 million, compared to $41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
primarily due to additional employees retained from Focus and an increase in amortization of the core deposit intangible assets as a result of the Focus acquisition, annual salary increases, newly
hired employees and higher professional fees, partially offset by $3.4 million of pre-tax acquisition, severance and retention costs incurred by the Company for the first nine months of 2015.   

Capital Management      

As part of its asset and liability management process, the Company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth,
expected earnings, risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     

          The Company earns income from two primary sources. The first is net interest income, which is interest income generated by earning assets less
interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The second is noninterest income, which primarily consists of gains on the sale of loans, loan servicing fees, customer service charges and fees, the
increase in cash surrender value of life insurance, and gains on the sale of securities. The majority of the Company's noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of
banking and lending services to our customers.   

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin      

          The level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination, including yields on earning assets, the cost of interest-bearing
liabilities, the relative volumes of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the mix of products which comprise the Company's earning assets, deposits, and other interest-bearing
liabilities. To maintain its net interest margin the Company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid.   

          The
following Distribution, Rate and Yield table presents the average amounts outstanding for the major categories of the Company's balance sheet, the average interest rates earned or
paid thereon, and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated. Average balances are based on daily averages.

The
Company's net interest margin (FTE), expressed as a percentage of average earning assets, contracted 29 basis points to 4.10% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 4.39% for the
third quarter of 2015, primarily due lower yields on loans and securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net interest margin decreased 35 basis points to 4.19%, from 4.54% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to higher average balances of lower yielding funds at the Federal Reserve Bank, and lower yields on loans and securities, which was
partially offset by an increase in the accretion of the loan purchase discount from the Focus transaction.   

The
accretion of the loan purchase discount in loan interest income from the Focus transaction was $299,000 for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $262,000 for the third quarter of
2015. The accretion of the loan purchase discount in loan interest income from the Focus transaction was $1.1 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared to $262,000 for the first nine
months of 2015. The total purchase discount on non-impaired loans from the Focus loan portfolio was $4.6 million as of the acquisition date, of which $2.5 million has been accreted to
loan interest income from the acquisition date through September 30, 2016.   

          The
yield on the loan portfolio was 5.60% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 5.70% for the third quarter of 2015. The yield on the loan portfolio for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was 5.61%, compared to 5.69% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio for the third quarter and the first nine
months of 2016, compared to the respective periods in 2015, was primarily due to a decrease in the proportion of loans in the higher

yielding
Bay View Funding factored receivables portfolio relative to the addition of the Focus loans and growth in the Company's legacy portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the accretion of
the loan purchase discount from the Focus transaction.   

          Net
interest income increased 17% to $23.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $19.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. Net interest income increased 26%
to $68.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $54.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net interest income increased for the
third quarter and first nine months of 2016, compared to the respective periods in 2015, primarily due to organic growth in the loan portfolio, the accretion of the loan purchase discount from the
Focus transaction, and an increase in the average balance of investment securities.   

          A
majority of the Company's earning assets are variable-rate loans that re-price when the Company's prime lending rate is changed, compared to a large base of core deposits that are
generally slower to re-price. This causes the Company's balance sheet to be asset-sensitive, which means that all else being equal, the Company's net interest margin will be lower during periods when
short-term interest rates are falling and higher when rates are rising.   

Provision for Loan Losses      

          Credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. The Company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which
are presented in the statements of income as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The provision for
loan losses is determined by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the Company's allowance for loan losses and charging the shortfall or excess, if any, to the current quarter's
expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the Company's earnings. The provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are
dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management's assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio, the
valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the Company's market area.   

          There
was a $245,000 provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2016, compared to a credit provision for loan losses of $301,000 for the third quarter of 2015. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, there was a $997,000 provision for loan losses, compared to a $339,000 credit provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
allowance for loan losses, related to the commercial loan portfolio increased $1.4 million at September 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, as a result of a provision for loan losses
of $1.6 million, and net charge-offs of $118,000. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was primarily due to an increase in commercial loans outstanding and one commercial relationship
that went nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2016, and was fully reserved for. The allowance for loan losses related to the real estate portfolio decreased $313,000 at September 30, 2016
from December 31, 2015, as a result of net recoveries of $227,000, partially offset by a credit provision for loan losses of $540,000 as a result of improving credit quality factors.   

The
allowance for loan losses totaled $20.0 million, or 1.38% of total loans at September 30, 2016, compared to $18.7 million, or 1.41% of total loans at
September 30, 2015, and $18.9 million, or 1.39% of total loans at December 31, 2015. Net charge-offs totaled $134,000 for the third quarter of 2016, compared to net recoveries of
$281,000 for the third quarter of 2015, and net charge-offs of $182,000 for the fourth quarter of 2015. The allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans was 445.55% at September 30,
2016, compared to 340.49% at September 30, 2015, and 296.74% at December 31, 2015. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to bring the allowance for loan losses to a

  level
deemed appropriate by the Company based on the factors discussed under "Allowance for Loan Losses".   

Noninterest Income      

          The following table sets forth the various components of the Company's noninterest income for the periods indicated:   

Noninterest
income increased to $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $2.1 million for the third quarter of 2015. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, noninterest income increased to $8.6 million, compared to $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a
$1.0 million gain on proceeds from company owned life insurance and a $527,000 gain on sales of securities.   

The
Company maintains life insurance policies for some directors and officers that are subject to split-dollar life insurance agreements, which continue after the participant's
employment termination or retirement. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company received death benefit proceeds of $3.1 million from the life insurance policy of a former officer of a bank
acquired by the Company. The cash surrender value of the policy was $2.1 million, which resulted in a gain on proceeds from company owned life insurance of $1.0 million.   

          Historically,
a portion of the Company's noninterest income has been associated with its SBA lending activity, as gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing
income from loans sold with servicing rights retained. The gain on sales of SBA loans was $198,000 lower in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily as a result of
closing fewer loans to sell in the third quarter of 2016, and retaining some loans held-for-sale on the balance sheet due to lower market premiums.   

  67  

Table of Contents   

          The
servicing assets that result from the sales of SBA loans with servicing retained are amortized over the expected term of the loans using a method approximating the interest method.
Servicing income generally declines as the respective loans are repaid.   

Noninterest Expense      

          The following table sets forth the various components of the Company's noninterest expense for the periods indicated:   

(1)    Salaries
and employee benefits included pre-tax severance and retention costs related to the Focus transaction of $2.2 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, and $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

and employee benefits included pre-tax severance and retention costs related to the Focus transaction of $2.2 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, and $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    

Total
noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $14.3 million, compared to $16.4 million for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in noninterest expense in
the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015, was primarily due to pre-tax acquisition, severance and retention costs incurred by the Company related to the Focus transaction
totaling $2.9 million for the third quarter of 2015, which included severance and retention expense of $2.2 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, and $688,000 in other
acquisition and integration costs. Noninterest expense

Table of Contents   

  for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $43.4 million, compared to $41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to additional
employees retained from Focus and an increase in amortization of the core deposit intangible assets as a result of the Focus acquisition, annual salary increases, newly hired employees and higher
professional fees. Professional fees were significantly lower for the first nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to recoveries of legal fees on problem loans that were paid off. These
increases in noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were partially offset by $3.4 million of pre-tax acquisition, severance and retention costs incurred by the
Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which included severance and retention expense of $2.2 million in salaries and employee benefits expense, and $1.2 million in
other acquisition and integration costs. Full time equivalent employees were 264, 272, and 260 at September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, respectively.   

In
the normal course of business the Company becomes a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial
instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans, commercial or standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees. These instruments represent varying degrees of exposure to
risk in excess of the amounts included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company calculates an off-balance sheet credit risk reserve for all unfunded commitments.   

Income Tax Expense      

          The Company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis. The effective tax rate is determined by applying the Company's statutory
income tax rates to pre-tax book income as adjusted for permanent differences between pre-tax book income and actual taxable income. These permanent differences include, but are not limited to,
increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, interest on tax-exempt securities, certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions, and tax credits.   

          The
Company's Federal and state income tax expense for the three and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.1 million and $12.2 million, respectively. The
income tax expense was $2.2 million and $7.3 million for the same periods in 2015. The following table shows the Company's effective income tax rates for the periods indicated:   

The
effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was lower, compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to the impact of non-deductible merger related expenses in the third
quarter of 2015. The difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined Federal and state statutory tax rate of 42% is primarily the result of tax exempt securities, the Company's
investment in life insurance policies whose earnings are not subject to taxes, tax credits related to investments in low income housing limited partnerships, and Enterprise Zone hiring credits.   

Some
items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles leading to timing differences between the
Company's actual tax liability, and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income. These temporary differences comprise the "deferred" portion of the Company's tax expense or benefit,
which is accumulated on the Company's books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse.   

          Realization
of the Company's deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the Company generating sufficient future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible   

  70  

Table of Contents   

  temporary
differences and utilization of tax credit carryforwards and the net operating loss carryforwards for Federal and California state income tax purposes. The amount of deferred tax assets
considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable
income. Under generally accepted accounting principles a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is "more likely than not" that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including
forecasts of future income, cumulative losses, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions.   

          The
Company had net deferred tax assets of $20.3 million at September 30, 2016, and $22.2 million at December 31, 2015. After consideration of the matters in
the preceding paragraph, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 will be fully realized in
future years.   

Business Segment Information      

          The following presents the Company's operating segments. Transactions between segments consist primarily of borrowed funds. Intersegment
interest expense is allocated to the Factoring segment based on the Company's prime rate and funding costs. The provision for loan loss is allocated based on the segment's allowance for loan loss
determination which considers the effects of charge-offs. Noninterest income and expense directly attributable to a segment are assigned to it. Taxes are paid on a

  income
increased to $20.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $16.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, net interest income increased to $59.8 million, compared to $45.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net
interest income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the comparable periods in 2015, was primarily as a result of the Focus acquisition and organic growth
in the loan portfolio and an increase in the average balance of investment securities. The provision for loan losses was $237,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a
credit provision for loan losses of $291,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for loan losses was $949,000,
compared with a credit provision for loan losses of $328,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to an increase in loan
balances in the banking segment's commercial loan portfolio and one commercial relationship that went on nonaccrual during the third quarter, and was fully reserved for. Noninterest income increased
to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Noninterest income increased to
$8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Noninterest income for the third quarter
and first nine months of 2016 increased compared to the respective periods in 2105, primarily due to a $1.0 million gain from company owned life insurance and gains on sales of securities.
Noninterest expense decreased to $12.4 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to $14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to pre-tax acquisition, serverance and retention costs incurred by the
Company related to the Focus transaction totaling $2.9 million for the third quarter of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense was $38.0 million,
compared to $35.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, was primarily due to additional employees retained from Focus, an increase in amortization of the core deposit intangible assets as a result of the Focus
acquisition, annual salary increases and additional newly hired employees. The increase in noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was partially offset by
$3.4 million of pre-tax acquisition, serverance and retention costs incurred by the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

            Factoring.       Bay View Funding's primary business operation is purchasing and collecting factored receivables. Factored receivables are
receivables that
have been transferred by the originating organization and typically have not been subject to previous collection efforts. In a factoring transaction Bay View Funding directly purchases the receivables
generated by its clients at a discount to their face value. The transactions are structured to provide the clients with immediate working capital when there is a mismatch between payments to the
client for a good or service and the incurrence of operating costs required to provide for such good or service. The average life of the factored receivables is 34 days. The balance of the
purchased receivables as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $47.8 million and $42.3 million, respectively. Bay View Funding's net income was $471,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, compared $697,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Bay View Funding's net income was
$1.7 million, compared to $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30. 2015. Net interest income was $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30,
2016, and $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net interest income was $8.3 million, compared to
$8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net interest income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the
respective periods in 2015, was primarily due to a decrease in the average yield on the factored receivables portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the average balance of factored receivables
outstanding. The provision for loan losses was $8,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a credit provision for loan losses of $10,000 for the three months ended

months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income was $517,000, compared to $575,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Noninterest expense was $1.9 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2016, and $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense was
$5.3 million, compared to $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

FINANCIAL CONDITION     

          As of September 30, 2016, total assets increased to $2.53 billion, compared to $2.26 billion at September 30, 2015,

The following table summarizes the weighted average life and weighted average yields of securities at September 30, 2016:   

(1)    Reflects
tax equivalent yield based on a 35% tax rate.    

The
securities portfolio is the second largest component of the Company's interest-earning assets, and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to an analysis of the
financial condition of the Company. The portfolio serves the following purposes: (i) it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds, as may be required
by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender; (ii) it provides liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers; (iii) it can be used as
an interest rate risk management tool, since it provides a large base of assets, the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better
match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the Company; and (iv) it is an alternative interest-earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more
rapidly than loans.   

          The
Company's portfolio may include: (i) U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government sponsored entities' debt securities for liquidity and pledging; (ii) mortgage-backed
securities, which in many instances can also be used for pledging, and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio; (iii) municipal obligations, which provide tax free income and limited
pledging potential; and (iv) single entity issue trust preferred securities, which generally enhance the yield on the portfolio.   

The
Company classifies its securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase. Accounting guidance requires available-for-sale securities to be marked to
fair value with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders' equity. Monthly adjustments are made to reflect changes in the fair value of the Company's
available-for-sale securities.   

          The
investment securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled $370.0 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of 44% from $257.4 million at September 30,
2015, and decreased 4% from $385.1 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio was comprised of
$352.6 million agency mortgage-backed securities (all issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities), $16.4 million of single entity issue trust preferred securities, and
$1.0 million of corporate bonds. The pre-tax unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale at September 30, 2016 was   

  76  

Table of Contents   

  $8.0 million,
compared to a pre-tax unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale of $4.5 million at September 30, 2015, and a pre-tax unrealized gain on securities
available-for-sale of $501,000 at December 31, 2015.   

          The
Company received gross proceeds of $49.2 million on investment securities available-for-sale it sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 with a book value
totaling $48.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of securities of $527,000. The $48.7 million book value of investment securities sold included $30.1 million of U.S. Treasury
securities, $9.0 million of U.S. Government sponsored entities, $5.5 million of corporate bonds, and $4.1 million of agency mortgage-backed securities.   

          During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased $75.8 million of investment securities available-for-sale, which consisted of $51.8 million of
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") securities, with an average book yield of 1.96%, and $24.0 million of Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") securities, with an average
book yield of 1.95%.   

          At
September 30, 2016, investment securities held-to-maturity totaled $202.4 million, compared to $111.0 million at September 30, 2015, and
$109.3 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the Company's securities held-to-maturity portfolio, at amortized cost, was comprised of $111.6 million agency
mortgage-backed securities, and $90.8 million tax-exempt municipal bonds.   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company purchased $31.3 million of Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") securities held-to-maturity, with
an average book yield of 1.49%.   

          The
Company has not used interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to hedge fixed rate loans or securities.   

Loans      

          The Company's loans represent the largest portion of invested assets, substantially greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset
category, and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when reviewing the Company's financial condition.   

          Gross
loans, excluding loans held-for-sale, represented 57% of total assets at September 30, 2016, represented 59% at September 30, 2015, and represented 58% at
December 31, 2015. The ratio of loans to deposits was 65.36% at September 30, 2016, compared to 67.91% at September 30, 2015, and 65.87% at December 31, 2015.

Loan Distribution      

          The Loan Distribution table that follows sets forth the Company's gross loans, excluding loans held-for-sale, outstanding and the percentage
distribution in each category at the dates indicated:   

The
Company's loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial loans, primarily manufacturing, wholesale, and services, and commercial real estate, with other portfolios in land development
and construction, home equity and consumer loans. During the second and third quarters of 2016, the Company purchased jumbo single family residential mortgage loans totaling $51.6 million, all
of which are domiciled in California. The average loan principal amount is approximately $834,000, and the weighted average yield on the portfolio is 3.00%, net of servicing fees to the servicer.
Residential mortgages outstanding at September 30, 2016 totaled $49.3 million. The Company does not have any concentrations by industry or group of industries in its loan portfolio,
however, 57% of its gross loans were secured by real property at September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, and 58% at December 31, 2015. While no specific industry concentration
is considered significant, the Company's bank lending operations are substantially located in areas that are dependent on the technology and real estate industries and their supporting companies.   

          The
Company has established concentration limits in its loan portfolio for commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, construction loans and unsecured lending, among others. All
loan types are within established limits. The Company uses underwriting guidelines to assess the borrowers' historical cash
flow to determine debt service, and we further stress test the debt service under higher interest rate scenarios. Financial and performance covenants are used in commercial lending to allow the
Company to react to a borrower's deteriorating financial condition should that occur.   

          The
Company's commercial loans are made for working capital, financing the purchase of equipment or for other business purposes. Commercial loans include loans with maturities ranging
from thirty days to one year and "term loans" with maturities normally ranging from one to five years. Short-term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically
provide for periodic principal payments, with interest payable monthly. Term loans normally provide for floating interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest.   

          The
Company is an active participant in the SBA and U.S. Department of Agriculture guaranteed lending programs, and has been approved by the SBA as a lender under the Preferred Lender
Program. The Company regularly makes such guaranteed loans (collectively referred to as "SBA   

  78  

Table of Contents   

  loans").
The guaranteed portion of these loans is typically sold in the secondary market depending on market conditions. When the guaranteed portion of an SBA loan is sold the Company retains the
servicing rights for the sold portion. During the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016, loans were sold resulting in a gain on sales of SBA loans of $69,000, and $653,000,
respectively.   

          The
Company's factoring receivables are from the operations of Bay View Funding whose primary business is purchasing and collecting factored receivables. Factored receivables are
receivables that have been transferred by the originating organization and typically have not been subject to previous collection efforts. These receivables are acquired from a variety of companies,
including but not limited to service providers, transportation companies, manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, apparel companies, advertisers, and temporary staffing companies. The portfolio of
factored receivables is included in the Company's commercial loan portfolio.   

          The
commercial loan portfolio increased $49.8 million to $606.3 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $556.5 million at December 31, 2015, which
was primarily the result of an increase of $23.2 million in the asset-based lending portfolio, $18.8 million in the C I portfolio, and $7.8 million in the factored receivables
portfolio. C I line usage increased to 41% at September 30, 2016, compared to 39% at December 31, 2015.   

As
of September 30, 2016, commercial real estate mortgage loans of $612.0 million consist primarily of adjustable and fixed-rate loans secured by deeds of trust on
commercial and residential property. The
real estate mortgage loans at September 30, 2016, consist of $266.1 million, or 43%, of commercial owner occupied properties, $345.8 million, or 57%, of commercial investment
properties, and $91,000 of other properties. Properties securing the commercial real estate mortgage loans are generally located in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, the Company's primary market.   

          The
Company's commercial real estate loans consist primarily of loans based on the borrower's cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust on commercial and residential property to
provide a secondary source of repayment. The Company generally restricts real estate term loans to no more than 75% of the property's appraised value or the purchase price of the property during the
initial underwriting of the credit, depending on the type of property and its utilization. The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans. Maturities on real estate mortgage loans are generally
between five and ten years (with amortization ranging from fifteen to twenty-five years and a balloon payment due at maturity); however, SBA and certain other real estate loans that can be sold in the
secondary market may be granted for longer maturities.   

          The
Company's land and construction loans are primarily to finance the development/construction of commercial and single family residential properties. The Company utilizes underwriting
guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or availability of permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan. Construction loans are
provided only in our market area, and the Company has extensive controls for the disbursement process. Land and construction loans increased $3.5 million to $88.4 million, at
September 30, 2016, from $84.9 million, at September 30, 2015. Land and construction loans increased $3.9 million at September 30, 2016, from $84.4 million at
December 31, 2015.   

          The
Company makes home equity lines of credit available to its existing customers. Home equity lines of credit are underwritten initially with a maximum 75% loan to value ratio. Home
equity lines are reviewed semi-annually, with specific emphasis on loans with a loan to value ratio greater than 70%. The Company takes measures to work with customers to reduce line commitments and
minimize potential losses.   

          During
the second and third quarters of 2016, the Company purchased jumbo single family residential mortgage loans totaling $51.6 million, all of which are domiciled in
California. The average loan principal amount is approximately $834,000, and the weighted average yield on the portfolio is   

  79  

Table of Contents   

  3.00%,
net of servicing fees to the servicer. Residential mortgages outstanding at September 30, 2016 totaled $49.3 million.   

          Additionally,
the Company makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles, various types of consumer goods, and other personal purposes. Consumer loans generally provide
for the monthly payment of principal and interest. Most of the Company's consumer loans are secured by the personal property being purchased or, in the instances of home equity loans or lines, real
property.   

          With
certain exceptions, state chartered banks are permitted to make extensions of credit to any one borrowing entity up to 15% of the bank's capital and reserves for unsecured loans and
up to 25% of the bank's capital and reserves for secured loans. For HBC, these lending limits were $41.7 million and $69.6 million at September 30, 2016, respectively.   

Loan Maturities      

          The following table presents the maturity distribution of the Company's loans (excluding loans held-for-sale) as of September 30, 2016.
The table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined (fixed) interest rates and those with variable (floating) interest rates. Floating rates generally fluctuate with
changes in the prime rate as reflected in the Western Edition of The Wall Street Journal. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 57% of the Company's loan portfolio consisted of floating
interest rate loans.   

Loan Servicing      

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, $169.6 million and $116.6 million, respectively, in SBA loans were serviced by the
Company for others. Activity for loan servicing rights was as follows:

Table of Contents   

          Loan
servicing rights are included in accrued interest receivable and other assets on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets and reported net of amortization. There was no valuation
allowance as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, as the fair value of the assets was greater than the carrying value.   

          Activity
for the I/O strip receivable was as follows:   

Credit Quality      

          Financial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk, and could potentially receive less than a full return
of principal and interest if a debtor becomes
unable or unwilling to repay. Since loans are the most significant assets of the Company and generate the largest portion of its revenues, the Company's management of credit quality risk is focused
primarily on loan quality. Banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers' inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts and/or
downturns in national and regional economies and declines in overall asset values including real estate. In addition, certain debt securities that the Company may purchase have the potential of
declining in value if the obligor's financial capacity to repay deteriorates.   

          The
Company's policies and procedures identify market segments, set goals for portfolio growth or contraction, and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations. In
addition, these policies establish the Company's underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality. The Company's internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting
practices, credit granting procedures, training, risk management techniques, and familiarity with loan customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio.   

          The
Company's credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates, employment, general economic conditions, real estate values, and trends in
particular industries or geographic markets. As an independent community bank serving a specific geographic area, the Company must contend with the unpredictable changes in the general California
market and, particularly, primary local markets. The Company's asset quality has suffered in the past from the impact of national and regional economic recessions, consumer bankruptcies, and depressed
real estate values.   

          Nonperforming
assets are comprised of the following: loans for which the Company is no longer accruing interest; restructured loans which have been current under six months; loans
90 days or more past due and still accruing interest (although they are generally placed on nonaccrual when they become 90 days past due, unless they are both well-secured and in the
process of collection); and foreclosed assets. Past due loans 30 days or greater totaled $12.5 million and $5.9 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, of which $2.2 million and $591,000 were on nonaccrual. At September 30, 2016, there were also $4.0 million loans less than 30 days past due included in
nonaccrual loans held-for-investment. At December 31, 2015, there were also $4.1 million loans less than 30 days past due included in nonaccrual loans held-for-investment.   

          Management's
classification of a loan as "nonaccrual" is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan. At that point, the
Company stops accruing interest income, and reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued as income. The   

  81  

Table of Contents   

  Company
begins recognizing interest income only as cash interest payments are received and it has been determined the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt. The loans may or may not
be collateralized, and collection efforts are pursued. Loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original
repayment terms and where the Company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full restitution. Foreclosed assets consist of properties acquired by foreclosure or
similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale.   

          The
following table summarizes the Company's nonperforming assets at the dates indicated:   

The
following table presents nonperforming loans by class at the dates indicated:   

Nonperforming
assets were $4.8 million, or 0.19% of total assets, at September 30, 2016, compared to $5.9 million, or 0.26% of total assets, at September 30,
2015, and $6.7 million, or 0.29% of total assets, at December 31, 2015. Included in total nonperforming assets were foreclosed assets of $292,000 at September 30, 2016, compared
to $393,000 at September 30, 2015, and $364,000 at December 31, 2015.   

Loans
with a well-defined weakness, which are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain a loss if the deficiencies are not corrected, are categorized as
"classified." Classified loans include all loans considered as substandard, substandard-nonaccrual, and doubtful and may result from problems specific to a borrower's business or from economic
downturns that affect the borrower's ability to repay or that cause a decline in the value of the underlying collateral (particularly real estate). The principal balance of classified loans, was
$18.4 million at September 30, 2016, $17.6 million at September 30, 2015, and $18.6 million at December 31, 2015. There were no loans held-for-sale included
in classified loans at September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015. Loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, and are not
allocated an allowance for loan losses.   

  82  

Table of Contents    

          The following table provides a summary of the loan portfolio by loan type and credit quality classification at the dates indicated:   

Classified
commercial loans increased to $14.7 million at September 30, 2016, from $9.0 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to commercial loan
downgrades in excess of upgrades during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Classified commercial real estate loans decreased to $2.9 million at September 30, 2016, compared
to December 31, 2015, mainly as a result of upgrades and payoffs in the commercial real estate loan portfolio.   

          The
following provides a rollforward of troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs"):   

Allowance for Loan Losses      

          The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when
management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Management's methodology for estimating the
allowance balance consists of several key elements, which include specific allowances on individual impaired loans and the formula driven allowances on pools of loans with similar risk
characteristics. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged-off.   

          Specific
allowances are established for impaired loans. Management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due
according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. Loans for which the terms have been modified with a concession granted, and for which the
borrower is   

  83  

Table of Contents   

  experiencing
financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of impairment is measured based on the
fair value of the collateral less costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent, or on the present value of expected future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market. If the
measure of the impaired loans is less than the investment in the loan, the deficiency will be charged-off against the allowance for loan losses if the amount is a confirmed loss, or, alternatively, a
specific allocation within the allowance will be established. Loans that are considered impaired are specifically excluded from the formula portion of the allowance for loan losses analysis.   

          The
estimated loss factors for pools of loans that are not impaired are based on determining the probability of default and loss given default for loans within each segment of the
portfolio, adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect collectability as of the evaluation date. The Company's historical delinquency experience and loss experience are
utilized to determine the probability of default and loss given default for segments of the portfolio where the Company has experienced losses in the past. For segments of the portfolio where the
Company has no significant prior loss experience, the Company uses quantifiable observable industry data to determine the probability of default and loss given default.   

          The
following provides a summary of the risks associated with various segments of the Company's loan portfolio, which are factors management regularly considers when evaluating the
adequacy of the allowance:  

Commercial loans consist primarily of commercial and industrial loans (business lines of credit), and other commercial purpose loans. Repayment
of commercial and industrial loans is generally provided from the cash flows of the related business to which the loan was made. Adverse changes in economic conditions may result in a decline in
business activity, which may impact a borrower's ability to continue to make scheduled payments. The factored receivables at Bay View Funding are included in the Company's commercial loan portfolio;
however, they are evaluated for risk primarily based on the agings of the receivables. Faster turning receivables imply less risk and therefore warrant a lower associated allowance. Should the overall
aging for the portfolio increase, this structure will by formula increase the allowance to reflect the increasing risk. Should the portfolio turn more quickly, it would reduce the associated allowance
to reflect the reducing risk.   
            Real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by commercial and residential real estate. Also included in this segment are land and
construction loans and home equity lines of credit secured by real estate. As the majority of this segment is comprised of commercial real estate loans, risks associated with this segment lay
primarily within these loan types. Adverse economic conditions may result in a decline in business activity and increased vacancy rates for commercial properties. These factors, in conjunction with a
decline in real estate prices, may expose the Company to the potential for losses if a borrower cannot continue to service the loan with operating revenues, and the value of the property has declined
to a level such that it no longer fully covers the Company's recorded investment in the loan.   
            Consumer loans consist primarily of a large number of small loans and lines of credit. The majority of installment loans are made for consumer
and business purchases. Weakened economic conditions may result in an increased level of delinquencies within this segment, as economic pressures may impact the capacity of such borrowers to repay
their obligations.    

As
a result of the matters mentioned above, changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, economic conditions, historical loss experience and the condition of the various
markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses.   

  84  

Table of Contents   

          It
is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio. On an ongoing basis, we have engaged an outside
firm to perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio. The Federal Reserve Board and the California Department of Business Oversight Division of Financial Institutions also
review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of the examination process. Based on information currently available, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate.
However, the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if California economic conditions and the real estate market in the Company's market area were to weaken. Also, any weakness of a prolonged nature
in the technology industry would have a negative impact on the local market. The effect of such events, although uncertain at this time, could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans
and increased loan losses, which could adversely affect the Company's future growth and profitability. No assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty.

Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses     

The
allowance for loan losses totaled $20.0 million, or 1.38% of total loans at September 30, 2016, compared to $18.7 million, or 1.41% of total loans at
September 30, 2015, and $18.9 million, or 1.39% of total loans at December 31, 2015. The Company had net charge-offs of $134,000, or 0.04% of average loans, for the third quarter
of 2016, compared to net recoveries of $281,000, or  0.09% of average loans, for the third quarter of 2015, and net recoveries of $515,000, or  0.04% of average loans,
for the fourth quarter of 2015.   

          The
allowance for loan losses related to the commercial portfolio increased $1.4 million, at September 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase
in commercial loans outstanding and net charge-offs of $118,000, resulting in a provision to the allowance for loan losses of $1.5 million. The allowance for loan losses balance attributed to
commercial loans individually evaluated for impairment increased to $1.7 million at September 30, 2016, from $174,000 at December 31, 2015, primarily due to one commercial
relationship that went on nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2016, which was fully reserved for. The allowance for loan losses related to the real estate portfolio decreased $313,000 at
September 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, as a result of net recoveries of $227,000, partially offset by a credit provision for loan losses of $540,000, as a result of improving credit
quality factors.   

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets      

          On November 1, 2014, estimated goodwill of $13.0 million resulted from the acquisition Bay View Funding. On August 20,
2015, estimated goodwill of $32.6 million resulted from the merger of Focus. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities
and identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to adjustment during the first twelve months after the acquisition date if additional
information becomes available to indicate a more accurate or appropriate value for an asset or liability. Total goodwill at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was
$45.6 million, which was consisted of $32.6 million related to the Focus acquisition, and $13.0 million related to the Bay View Funding acquisition.   

          Goodwill
impairment exists when a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, which is determined through a qualitative assessment whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of
equity of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value ("Step Zero"). If the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of equity of a reporting unit is less than
book value, than a quantitative two step impairment test is required. Step 1 includes the determination of the carrying value of the Company's single reporting unit, including the existing goodwill
and intangible   

  87  

Table of Contents   

  assets,
and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company is required to perform a second step to the impairment test.
Step 2 requires that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.   

          The
Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of November 30. Goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances
change between annual tests that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company completed its annual impairment analysis on the goodwill
as of November 30, 2015 with the assistance of an independent valuation firm. Based on the Step Zero qualitative analysis performed, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that
the fair value of the Company's equity exceeded its reported book value of equity at November 30, 2015. As such, no impairment was indicated and no further testing was required.   

          Other
intangible assets were $7.3 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $8.5 million at December 31, 2015. Core deposit and customer relationship
intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Diablo Valley Bank in June 2007 were $301,000 at September 30, 2016 and $621,000 at December 31, 2015, net of accumulated amortization.
The core deposit intangible asset arising from the acquisition of Focus was $5.4 million at September 30, 2016 and $6.0 million at December 31, 2105, net of accumulated
amortization. A below market lease, customer relationship and brokered relationship, and a non-compete agreement intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Bay View Funding were
$1.7 million at September 30, 2016 and $1.9 million at December 31, 2015, net of accumulated amortization.   

Deposits      

          The composition and cost of the Company's deposit base are important components in analyzing the Company's net interest margin and balance sheet
liquidity characteristics, both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein. The Company's liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits from the propensity of that money
to leave the institution for
rate-related or other reasons. Deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken in California, and the Company's market area in particular. Potentially, the most volatile deposits in a
financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit, meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed $250,000, as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more
rate-sensitive than customers with smaller balances.   

          The
following table summarizes the distribution of deposits and the percentage of distribution in each category of deposits for the periods indicated:   

88  

Table of Contents   

          The
Company obtains deposits from a cross-section of the communities it serves. The Company's business is not generally seasonal in nature. Public funds were 4% of deposits at
September 30, 2016, and 5% at September 30, 2015, and 4% at December 31, 2015.   

          Total
deposits increased $256.6 million, or 13%, to $2.22 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $1.96 billion at September 30, 2015, and increased
$155.9 million, or 8%, at September 30, 2016, compared to $2.06 billion at December 31, 2015. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $130.6 million at
September 30, 2016 from September 30, 2015, and increased $67.7 million from December 31, 2015. Interest-bearing demand deposits increased $96.0 million at
September 30, 2016 from September 30, 2015, and increased $40.3 million from December 31, 2015. Savings and money market deposits increased $64.6 million at
September 30, 2016 from September 30, 2015, and increased $58.3 million from December 31, 2015. Brokered deposits decreased $21.2 million at September 30,
2016 from September 30, 2015, and decreased $14.8 million from December 31, 2015. Deposits excluding all time deposits and CDARS deposits increased $291.2 million, or 17%,
to $1.98 billion at September 30, 2016, from $1.69 billion at September 30, 2015, and increased $166.2 million, or 9%, from $1.81 billion at
December 31, 2015.   

          At
September 30, 2016, the Company had $96.7 million (at fair value) of securities pledged for $85.1 million in certificates of deposits from the State of
California. At September 30, 2015, the Company had $108.8 million (at fair value) of securities pledged for $98.0 million in certificates of deposits from the State of California.
At December 31, 2015, the Company had $93.0 million (at fair value) of securities pledged for $78.0 million in certificates of deposits from the State of California.   

          CDARS
deposits were comprised of $4.1 million of money market accounts and $3.6 million of time deposits at September 30, 2016. CDARS deposits were comprised of
$2.9 million of money market accounts and $5.1 million of time deposits at September 30, 2015. CDARS deposits were comprised of $3.4 million of money market accounts and
$4.2 million of time deposits at December 31, 2015.   

          The
following table indicates the contractual maturity schedule of the Company's time deposits of $250,000 and over, and all CDARS time deposits and brokered deposits as of
September 30, 2016:   

The
Company focuses primarily on providing and servicing business deposit accounts that are frequently over $250,000 in average balance per account. As a result, certain types of
business clients that the Company serves typically carry average deposits in excess of $250,000. The account activity for some account types and client types necessitates appropriate liquidity
management practices by the Company to help ensure its ability to fund deposit withdrawals.

          The following table indicates the ratios for return on average assets and average equity, and average equity to average assets for the periods

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      

          In the normal course of business the Company makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any
conditions established in the contractual arrangements. These commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the Company, but are not reflected on the Company's consolidated
balance sheets. Total unused commitments to extend credit were $601.1 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $579.0 million at September 30, 2015, and
$573.7 million at December 31, 2015. Unused commitments represented 41% outstanding gross loans at September 30, 2016, 43% outstanding gross loans at September 30, 2015,
and 42% at December 31, 2015.   

          The
effect on the Company's revenues, expenses, cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no
certainty that lines of credit and letters of credit will ever be fully utilized. The following table presents the Company's commitments to extend credit for the periods indicated:   

Liquidity and Asset/Liability Management      

          Liquidity refers to the Company's ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in
a timely and cost effective fashion. At various times the Company requires funds to meet short-term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows, the purchase of assets, or
liability repayments. An integral part of the Company's ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the Company's large base of core deposits, which are generated by offering traditional
banking services in its service area and which have historically been a stable source of funds. To manage liquidity needs properly cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows or
sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands. The Company manages liquidity to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities
without maintaining excessive amounts of balance sheet liquidity. Excess   

  90  

Table of Contents   

  balance
sheet liquidity can negatively impact the Company's interest margin. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs the Company utilizes overnight Federal funds purchase arrangements and other
borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks, solicits brokered deposits if cost effective
deposits are not available from local sources, and maintains collateralized lines of credit with the FHLB and FRB. In addition, the Company can raise cash for temporary needs by selling securities
under agreements to repurchase and selling securities available-for-sale.   

The
loan to deposit ratio is one of the measures we analyze for liquidity. Our loan to deposit ratio was 65.36% at September 30, 2016, compared to 67.91% at September 30,
2015, and 65.87% at December 31, 2015.   

FHLB and FRB Borrowings and Available Lines of Credit      

          The Company has off-balance sheet liquidity in the form of Federal funds purchase arrangements with correspondent banks, including the FHLB and
FRB. The Company can borrow from the FHLB on a short-term (typically overnight) or long-term (over one year) basis. The Company had no overnight borrowings from the FHLB at September 30, 2016,
September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015. The Company had $219.5 million of loans pledged to the FHLB as collateral on an available line of credit of $182.4 million at
September 30, 2016.   

          The
Company can also borrow from the FRB's discount window. The Company had $479.3 million of loans pledged to the FRB as collateral on an available line of credit of
$314.9 million at September 30, 2016, none of which was outstanding.   

          At
September 30, 2016, the Company had Federal funds purchase arrangements available of $55.0 million. There were no Federal funds purchased outstanding at
September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015.   

          The
Company has a $5.0 million line of credit with a correspondent bank, of which none was outstanding at September 30, 2016.   

          The
Company may also utilize securities sold under repurchase agreements to manage our liquidity position. There were no securities sold under agreements to repurchase at
September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015.   

The
following table summarizes the Company's borrowings under its Federal funds purchased, security repurchase arrangements and lines of credit for the periods indicated:   

Capital Resources      

          The Company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy. Management reviews various capital measurements on a regular basis and
takes appropriate action to ensure that such measurements are within established internal and external guidelines. The external guidelines, which are issued by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC,
establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures.

The

          The
following table presents the applicable well-capitalized regulatory guidelines and the standards for minimum capital adequacy requirements under Basel III:   

(1)    Includes
0.625% capital conservation buffer, except the leverage capital ratio.
      (2)    Includes
2.5% capital conservation buffer, except the leverage capital ratio.    

The
Basel III capital rules introduce a new "capital conservation buffer," for banking organizations to maintain a common equity Tier 1 ratio more than 2.5% above these minimum
risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to
risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The
implementation of the capital conservation buffer was phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each
subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).   

          The
Company's common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased at September 30, 2016, compared to September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, primarily
due to the conversion of the Company's Series C convertible perpetual preferred stock, no par value ("Series C Preferred Stock") for 5,601,000 shares of the Company's common stock during
the third quarter of 2016, as discussed below. The conversion of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock into common stock had no effect on HBC's common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio. During the third, second and first quarters of 2016, HBC distributed dividends of $4.0 million, $4.0 million, and $6.0 million, respectively, for a total of
$14.0 million for the first nine months of 2016.   

          At
September 30, 2016, the Company's consolidated capital ratio exceeded regulatory guidelines and HBC's capital ratios exceed the highest regulatory capital requirement of
"well-capitalized" under Basel III prompt corrective action provisions. Quantitative measures established by regulation to help ensure capital adequacy require the Company and HBC to maintain minimum
amounts and ratios of total risk-based capital, Tier 1 capital, and common equity Tier 1 (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1
capital to average assets (as defined). Management believes that, as of September 30, 2016, September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, the Company and HBC met all capital adequacy
guidelines to which they were subject. There are no conditions or events since September 30, 2016, that management believes have changed the categorization of the Company or HBC as
well-capitalized.   

          At
September 30, 2016, the Company had total shareholders' equity of $261.3 million, compared to $248.0 million at September 30, 2015, and
$245.4 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, total shareholders' equity included $214.6 million in common stock, $48.7 million in retained earnings,
and ($2.0) million of accumulated other comprehensive loss.   

  93  

Table of Contents   

          The
accumulated other comprehensive loss was ($2.0) million at September 30, 2016, compared to accumulated other comprehensive loss of ($2.0) million at September 30, 2015,
and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of ($6.2) million at December 31, 2015. The unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale, net of taxes, included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss was an unrealized gain of $4.7 million, at September 30, 2016, compared to an unrealized gain of $2.6 million, at September 30, 2015, and an unrealized
gain of $296,000, at December 31, 2015. The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, at September 30, 2016 include the following: an unrealized gain on
available-for-sale securities of $4.7 million; the remaining unamortized unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale transferred to held-to-maturity of $342,000; a split dollar insurance
contracts liability of ($3.6) million; a supplemental executive retirement plan liability of ($4.0) million; and an unrealized gain on interest-only strip from SBA loans of $639,000.   

Series C Preferred Stock      

          On September 12, 2016, the Company entered into Exchange Agreements with Castle Creek Capital Partners IV, LP, Patriot Financial
Partners, L.P. and Patriot Financial Partners Parallel, L.P. (collectively "Preferred Stockholders") providing for the exchange of 21,003.75 shares of the Company's Series C
Preferred Stock for 5,601,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The exchange ratio was equal to the equivalent number of shares the Preferred Stockholders would have received upon conversion of
the Series C Preferred Stock.   

          As
a result of the exchange transaction, the Company had 37,915,736 shares of common stock issued and outstanding on September 30, 2016. Castle Creek owns 3,763,225 shares, or
9.9% of the issued and outstanding shares; and Patriot Financial and Patriot Parallel own together 4,437,204 shares, or 11.7% of the issued and outstanding shares. The exchange of the Series C
Preferred Stock for common stock resulted in an increase in the Company's common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio at September 30, 2016, but had no effect on HBC's common equity
tier 1 risk-based capital ratio or other regulatory capital ratios of the Company or HBC.   

          The
book value per common share was $6.89 at September 30, 2016, compared to $7.12 at September 30, 2015, and $7.03 at December 31, 2015. The tangible book value per
common share was $5.49 at September 30, 2016, compared to $5.44 at September 30, 2015, and $5.35 at December 31, 2015. On a full conversion of the Series C Preferred stock
into common stock at September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015: (i) the book value per common share would have been reduced to $6.58 and $6.51, respectively; and (ii) the
tangible book value per common share would have been reduced to $5.15 and $5.07, respectively.   

Market Risk     

          Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values, or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial
instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that
affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments, including securities, loans, deposits and borrowings, as well as the Company's
role as a financial intermediary in customer-related transactions. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company's earnings and equity to loss and to reduce the
volatility inherent in certain financial instruments.   

Interest Rate Management     

          Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The Company's market risk exposure is
primarily that of interest rate risk, and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest   

  94  

Table of Contents   

  rates.
The Company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments, nor does the Company have exposure to currency exchange rates.   

          The
principal objective of interest rate risk management (often referred to as "asset/liability management") is to manage the financial components of the Company in a manner that will
optimize the risk/reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates. The Company's exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Asset/Liability
Committee. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of
current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income.
Management realizes certain risks are inherent, and that the goal is to identify and manage the risks. Management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk: (i) a standard GAP
analysis; and (ii) an interest rate shock simulation model.   

          The
planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution's net interest margin. To the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not
match in a changing interest rate environment, the net interest margin may change over time. Even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities, risks remain in the form of prepayment of
loans or securities or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest-bearing liabilities. The Company has generally
been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities.   

Interest
rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time. Varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment
levels of assets and liabilities, which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table. Because of these factors, an interest
sensitivity GAP report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates.   

          The
Company uses modeling software for asset/liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the Company's net interest margin, and to
calculate the estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios. The program imports current balances, interest rates, maturity dates and repricing
information for individual financial instruments, and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for new volumes to project the effects of a
given interest rate change on the Company's interest income and interest expense. Rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the Company's investment, loan,
deposit and borrowed funds portfolios. These rate projections can be shocked (an immediate and parallel change in all base rates, up or down) and ramped (an incremental increase or decrease in rates
over a specified time period), based on current trends and econometric models or stable economic conditions (unchanged from current actual levels).   

The
following table sets forth the estimated changes in the Company's annual net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates
noted, as of September 30, 2016. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based   

  95  

Table of Contents   

  on
numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.   

This
data does not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive
factors, which could reduce the actual impact on net interest income.   

          As
with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent to the methodology noted above. The model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous
parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, rate changes are rarely instantaneous. The use of the simplifying assumption that short-term and long-term rates change by the same degree may also
misstate historic rate patterns, which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts. Further, the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react in
the same way to changes in rates. In reality, certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates, while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag
behind the change in general market rates. Additionally, the methodology noted above does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets, such
as adjustable rate loans. When interest rates change, actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model. Finally,
this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan clients' ability to service their debt. All of these factors are considered in monitoring the
Company's exposure to interest rate risk.    

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK            

          The information concerning quantitative and qualitative disclosure or market risk called for by Item 305 of Regulation S-K is
included as part of Item 2 above.    

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES            

Disclosure Control and Procedures     

          The Company has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. As defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. Disclosure controls are also designed
to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial

  Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded the Company's
disclosure controls were effective as September 30, 2016, the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q.   

          During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Part II OTHER INFORMATION            

ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS            

          The Company is involved in certain legal actions arising from normal business activities. Management, based upon the advice of legal counsel,
believes the ultimate resolution of all pending legal actions will not have a material effect on the financial statements of the Company.    

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS            

          In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the other factors discussed in Part I,

results. There were no material changes from risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors identified are in addition to those contained in any
other cautionary statements, written or oral, which may be or otherwise addressed in connection with a forward-looking statement or contained in any of our subsequent filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.    

ITEM 2 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
      4.    The
registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

(a)    Designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material
information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
prepared;
      (b)    Designed
such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
      (c)    Evaluated
the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the

      (d)    Disclosed
in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter
(the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting; and
     
   5.    The
registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's
auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

(a)    All
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
      (b)    Any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.
