1.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

As
of October 31, 2016, InnSuites Hospitality Trust (the  Trust,   we  or  our ) owns interests
directly and through a partnership interest in four hotels with an aggregate of 575 suites in Arizona, southern California and
New Mexico (the  Hotels ). The Hotels operate under the trade name  InnSuites Hotels.   

Full
service hotels often contain upscale full-service facilities with a large volume of full service accommodations, on-site full
service restaurant(s) and a variety of on-site amenities such as swimming pools, a health club, children s activities, ballrooms
and on-site conference facilities. Moderate or limited service hotels are small to medium-sized hotel establishments that offer
a limited number of on-site amenities. Most moderate or limited service establishments may still offer full service accommodations
but lack leisure amenities such as an on-site restaurant or a swimming pool. We consider our Tucson, Arizona hotel and our hotel
located in Albuquerque, New Mexico to be moderate or limited service establishments. All of our other properties are full service
hotels.  

The
Trust is the sole general partner of RRF Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the  Partnership ),
and owned a 72.11% interest in the Partnership as of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016, respectively. The Trust s weighted
average ownership for the nine-month period ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was 72.11%. As of October 31, 2016, the Partnership
owned a 51.01% interest in an InnSuites  hotel located in Tucson, Arizona and a 51.33% interest in an InnSuites  hotel
located in Ontario, California. The Trust owns a direct 50.24% interest in a Yuma, Arizona hotel property, and a direct 50.91%
interest in an InnSuites  hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  

Under
certain management agreements, InnSuites Hotels Inc. ( InnSuites Hotels ), our subsidiary, manages the Hotels 
daily operations. The Trust also provides the use of the  InnSuites  trademark to the Hotels through wholly-owned
InnSuites Hotels. All such expenses and reimbursements between the Trust, InnSuites Hotels and the Partnership have been eliminated
in consolidation.  

InnDependent
Boutique Collection ( IBC Hotels  or  IBC Developments ), a wholly owned subsidiary of InnSuites Hospitality
Trust, has a network of approximately 6,500 unrelated hotel properties and provides revenue generating services and cost savings
solutions to independent boutique hotels. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, IBC Hotels formed a marketing alliance
with the Independent Lodging Industry Association ( ILIA ).  

PARTNERSHIP
AGREEMENT  

The
Partnership Agreement of the Partnership provides for the issuance of two classes of Limited Partnership units, Class A and Class
B. Class A and Class B Partnership units are identical in all respects, except that each Class A Partnership unit is convertible
into one newly-issued Share of Beneficial Interest of the Trust at any time at the option of the particular limited partner. The
Class B Partnership units may only become convertible, each into one newly-issued Share of Beneficial Interest of the Trust, with
the approval of the Board of Trustees, in its sole discretion. On October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016, 276,131 Class A Partnership
units were issued and outstanding, representing 2.09% of the total Partnership units. Additionally, as of both October 31, 2016
and January 31, 2016, 3,407,938 Class B Partnership units were outstanding to James Wirth, the Trust s Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and Mr. Wirth s affiliates. If all of the Class A and B Partnership units were converted on October 31,
2016, the limited partners in the Partnership would receive 3,684,069 Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Trust. As of October
31, 2016 and January 31, 2016, the Trust owns 9,527,448 general partner units in the Partnership, representing 72.11% of the total
Partnership units.  

LIQUIDITY  

Our principal source of
cash to meet our cash requirements, including distributions to our shareholders, is our share of the Partnership s cash flow,
quarterly distributions from the Albuquerque, New Mexico and Yuma, Arizona properties and more recently, sales of non-controlling
interests in our Hotels. The Partnership s principal source of cash flow is quarterly distributions from the Tucson, Arizona
and Ontario, California properties. Our liquidity, including our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, will depend
upon our ability and the Partnership s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations and to service our
debt. 

As of October 31, 2016,
the Trust had a related party Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note with an amount payable of approximately $0.
The Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note has a maximum borrowing capacity to $1,000,000, which is available through
December 31, 2017. As of December 12, 2016, the outstanding net balance receivable on the Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory
Note was $0. 

As of October 31, 2016,
the Trust had two available Advances to Affiliate credit facilities each with a maximum borrowing capacity of $500,000 for a total
maximum borrowing capacity of $1,000,000. As of October 31, 2016, the Trust had an amount payable of approximately $426,000 on
one of the Advances to Affiliates credit facility and an amount receivable of approximately $116,000 on the other Advances to
Affiliates credit facility. 

Both the Demand/Revolving
Line of Credit/Promissory Note and the Advances to Affiliate credit facilities accrues interest at 7.0% per annum and requires
interest only payments quarterly. 

With approximately $496,000
of cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2016 and the availability of a $1,000,000 related party Demand/Revolving
Line of Credit/Promissory Note, $1,000,000 Advances to Affiliates credit facilities and the availability of the two unsecured
loans of $475,000 provided on December 2, 2016, We believe that we will have enough cash on hand to meet all of our financial
obligations as they become due for at least the next year. In addition, our management is analyzing other strategic options available
to us, including the refinancing of another property or raising additional funds through additional non-controlling interest sales;
however, such transactions may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. 

There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in obtaining extensions, refinancing debt or raising additional or replacement funds, or that these
funds may be available on terms that are favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional or replacement funds, we may be
required to sell certain of our assets to meet our liquidity needs, which may not be on terms that are favorable. The results for
the period ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending
January 31, 2017 or any future period. 

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ). Certain information related to the Trust s organization, significant accounting policies and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States ( GAAP ) has been condensed or omitted. The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the Trust s annual consolidated
financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2016, as filed on our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April
29, 2016. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows for the periods presented and the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate when read in conjunction with the Trust s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016. The results for the period
ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending January 31,
2017 or any future period. 

As sole general partner
of the Partnership, the Trust exercises unilateral control over the Partnership, and the Trust owns all of the issued and outstanding
classes of shares of InnSuites Hotels. Therefore, the financial statements of the Partnership and InnSuites Hotels are consolidated
with the Trust, and all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

On August 1, 2015, the Trust finalized and committed to a plan to sell all the Hotel properties. As of May
1, 2016, the Trust has listed all the Hotel properties with a local real estate hotel broker, and management believes that each
of the assets is being marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The Trust believes that the
plan to sell these assets will not be withdrawn. Through the Trust s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2016 filed
with the SEC on September 14, 2016, the Trust classified all the Hotel properties as Assets Held for Sale. As of October 31, 2016,
the Trust has decided to reclassify these assets back into operations as many of these assets have been marketed for sale for more
than one year. At this time, the Trust is unable to predict when, and if, any of these Hotel properties will be sold, therefore
such sale is no longer considered probable. The Trust continues to list these properties with local real estate hotel brokers and,
we believe, that each of the assets is being marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. There
have been no other material changes to our basis of presentation since January 31, 2016. 

SEASONALITY
OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS  

The
Hotels  operations historically have been somewhat seasonal. The two southern Arizona hotels experience their highest occupancy
in the first fiscal quarter and, to a lesser extent, the fourth fiscal quarter. The second fiscal quarter tends to be the lowest
occupancy period at those two southern Arizona hotels. This seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in the Trust s
quarterly revenues. The two hotels located in California and New Mexico historically experience their most profitable periods
during the second and third fiscal quarters (the summer season), providing some balance to the general seasonality of the Trust s
hotel business.  

The
seasonal nature of the Trust s business increases its vulnerability to risks such as labor force shortages and cash flow
issues. Further, if an adverse event such as an actual or threatened terrorist attack, international conflict, data breach, regional
economic downturn or poor weather conditions should occur during the first or fourth fiscal quarters the adverse impact to the
Trust s revenues could likely be greater as a result of its southern Arizona seasonal business.  

It
is too early to determine what the seasonality of the IBC segment is. The Trust does not anticipate much seasonality due to the
diversification of the location of the IBC Hotels.  

RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  

Since
July 31, 2016, no significant recently issued accounting guidance exists that is material to the Trust. Management continues to
monitor and review recently issued accounting guidance upon issuance.  

2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

USE
OF ESTIMATES  

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.  

The
Trust s operations are affected by numerous factors, including the economy, competition in the hotel industry and the effect
of the economy on the travel and hospitality industries. The Trust cannot predict if any of the above items will have a significant
impact in the future, nor can it predict what impact, if any, the occurrence of these or other events might have on the Trust s
operations and cash flows. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include, but are not limited to, the estimated
useful lives of long-lived assets and estimates of future cash flows used to test a long-lived asset for recoverability and the
fair values of the long-lived assets.  

PROPERTY,
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND HOTEL PROPERTIES  

Furniture,
fixtures, building improvements and hotel properties are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over
estimated lives ranging up to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 10 years for furniture and equipment.  

Management
applies guidance under ASC 360-10-35 to determine when it is required to test an asset for recoverability of its carrying value
and whether an impairment exists. Under ASC 360-10-35, the Trust is required to test a long-lived asset for impairment when there
is an indicator of impairment. Impairment indicators may include, but are not limited to, a drop in the performance of a long-lived
asset, a decline in the hospitality industry or a decline in the economy. If an indicator of potential impairment is present,
then an assessment is performed of whether the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows
over its estimated remaining life.  

If
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the asset s estimated remaining life are greater than the asset s
carrying value, no impairment is recognized; however, if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows, then the Trust would recognize an impairment expense to the extent the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair
value, if any. The estimated future cash flows are based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating
performance, and may differ from actual cash flows. Long-lived assets evaluated for impairment are analyzed on a property-specific
basis independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Evaluation of future cash flows is based on historical experience
and other factors, including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings. Management has determined that no impairment
of long-lived assets existed during the Trust s fiscal quarters ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  

REVENUE
RECOGNITION  

Staff
Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 104,  Revenue Recognition  ( SAB No. 104 ) summarizes the
SEC s views in applying GAAP to revenue recognition in financial statements. SAB No. 104 establishes the SEC s view
that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable;
and collectability is reasonably assured. Further, SAB No. 104 requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership
be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized. We believe that our revenue recognition policies as described below
are in compliance with SAB No. 104.  

Revenues
are primarily derived from the following sources and are recognized as services are rendered and when collectability is reasonably
assured. Amounts received in advance of revenue recognition are considered deferred liabilities.  

Revenues
primarily consist of room rentals, food and beverage sales, management and trademark fees and other miscellaneous revenues from
our properties. Revenues are recorded when rooms are occupied and when food and beverage sales are delivered. Management and trademark
fees from hotels include a monthly accounting fee and a percentage of hotel room revenues for managing the daily operations of
the Hotels and the two hotels owned by affiliates of Mr. Wirth. IBC Development revenues are recognized after services are rendered
by the IBC member hotel.  

We
are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit these back to the applicable
governmental agencies on a periodic basis. We have a legal obligation to act as a collection agent. We do not retain these taxes
and fees and, therefore, they are not included in revenues. We record a liability when the amounts are collected and relieve the
liability when payments are made to the applicable taxing authority or other appropriate governmental agency.  

Based
on our policy, we recognize revenue when we believe that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and the collectability of our revenues
are reasonably assured.  

INCOME
PER SHARE  

Basic
and diluted income per Share of Beneficial Interest is computed based on the weighted-average number of Shares of Beneficial Interest
and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Dilutive securities are limited to the Class A and Class B
units of the Partnership, which are convertible into 3,684,069 Shares of the Beneficial Interest, as discussed above in Note 1
   Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation.   

At
the beginning of each nine month period ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate weighted-average of these Shares of Beneficial
Interest for units of the Partnership would have been 3,684,069 and 3,693,972, respectively. These Shares of Beneficial Interest
issuable upon conversion of the Class A and Class B Partnership units were anti-dilutive during the nine month period ended October
31, 2016 and 2015. Therefore, no reconciliation of basic and diluted income per share is presented.  

3.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

TRUSTEE
STOCK COMPENSATION  

For
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, the Trust recognized expenses of $38,880 related to stock-based compensation. The Trust
issued 24,000 restricted shares with a total market value of $51,840 in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2017 as compensation
to its three outside Trustees for fiscal year 2017. On a monthly basis through January 31, 2017, these shares vest at a rate of
approximately 500 shares for each outside Trustee. These purchases were made by the recipients on the open market in May 2016.  

The
following table summarizes restricted share activity during the nine months ended October 31, 2016:  

STOCK
OPTIONS  

Effective
February 5, 2015, the Board of Trustees of the Trust adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2015 Plan ), subject
to shareholder approval, under which up to 1,600,000 Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Trust are authorized to be issued pursuant
to grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units or other awards. The purpose of
the 2015 Plan and the awards described below is to promote the interests of the Trust and its shareholders by providing certain
employees and members of the Board of Trustees, who are largely responsible for the management and growth of the subsidiary of
the Trust, IBC Hotels, with incentives and rewards to encourage them to continue in the service of the Trust.  

The
Board of Trustees of the Trust approved a Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement ( 2015 Plan Agreement ) to be used for
all stock option awards. The 2015 Plan Agreement provides the grantee a four-year option to purchase a set number of Shares of
Beneficial Interest of the Trust at an exercise price of $3.50 per share, exercisable to the extent the stock options vest and
GAAP pre-tax profits of IBC Hotels are greater than or equal to the performance objectives described in the 2015 Plan agreement.
For purposes of the 2015 Plan Agreement, a  tranche  is the number of Shares for which the Stock Option has vested
on a particular vesting date. The 2015 Plan Agreement has the following vesting schedule:  

Stock
options will become immediately vested in full if, prior to a vesting date (i) the grantee ceases to be employed by the Trust
or its subsidiaries by reason of death or disability or (ii) a change of control occurs while the grantee is employed by the Trust
or any of its subsidiaries. Vested tranches become exercisable as set forth below to the extent that the GAAP pre-tax profit of
IBC Hotels is greater than or equal to the performance objective for the applicable performance period, as described below.  

On
February 5, 2015, the Board of Trustees of the Trust granted to Pamela Barnhill, President, Vice Chairperson of the Board of Trustees
and Chief Operating Officer of the Trust and IBC Hotels Founder and President, pursuant to the 2015 Plan and 2015 Plan Agreement,
an option to purchase of 1,000,000 Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Trust. On April 24, 2015, the Board of Trustees of the
Trust granted to James Wirth, Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of the Trust, Marc Berg, Executive
Vice President of the Trust and Trustee, and Adam Remis, Chief Financial Officer of the Trust, pursuant to the Trust s 2015
Plan and 2015 Plan Agreement, each an option to purchase 60,000 Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Trust. On April 24, 2015,
the Board of Trustees of the Trust also granted an option to purchase 10,000 Shares of Beneficial Interest of the Trust to each
of our Trustees who are expected to continue to serve on the Board of Trustees through the vesting period and also granted to
key operational staff options to purchase Shares of Beneficial Interest. The number of options granted to each key operational
staff was based on InnSuites employment history and their direct IBC Hotels involvement. A total of 1,434,500 stock options were
granted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The options are subject to shareholder approval. Consistent with ASC 718-10-55-10,
compensation cost associated with issuance of these options has not been recognized as shareholder approval is not perfunctory.
The Board of Trustees of the Trust has decided to terminate the 2015 Plan. Management believes that a new plan needs to be created
to act as a financial incentive to the Trusts employees. Effective October 31, 2016, it has been determined that the Shareholders
will not approve the 2015 Plan and the proposed grants have been rescinded.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

On
December 1, 2014, the Trust entered into a $1,000,000 net maximum Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note with Rare Earth.
The Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note bears interest at 7.0% per annum, requires interest payments only quarterly
and matures on December 31, 2017. No prepayment penalty exists on the Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note. The balance
fluctuates significantly through the period. The Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note has a net maximum borrowing capacity
of $1,000,000.  

The
above Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note or Note Receivable is presented as one line item on the balance sheet and
totaled a  receivable balance of $0 and $5,671 at October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

As
of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016, Mr. Wirth and his affiliates held 3,407,938 Class B Partnership units, which represented
25.80% of the total outstanding Partnership units. As of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016, Mr. Wirth and his affiliates held
6,939,429 and 6,175,205, respectively, Shares of Beneficial Interest in the Trust, which represented 74.31% and 70.24%,
respectively, of the total issued and outstanding Shares of Beneficial Interest. For the nine months ended October 31, 2016, Mr.
Wirth s affiliates paid the Trust $208,256 for management and licensing fees and $35,464 for reservation fees.  

On
December 22, 2015, the Trust provided Advances to Affiliates   Related Party each in the amount
of $500,000 to Phoenix Northern Resort, LLC and Tempe/Phoenix Airport Resort LLC. Mr. Wirth, individually and through one of his
affiliates, owns approximately 32% and 42%, respectively, of Phoenix Northern Resort, LLC and Tempe/Phoenix Airport Resort LLC.
Both notes have a due date of June 30, 2017 and accrue interest of 7.0%. During the nine months ended October 31, 2016, the Trust
received $18,098 and $14,328 interest income from Phoenix Northern Resort, LLC and Tempe/Phoenix Airport Resort LLC, respectively.
 As of October 31, 2016 the Advances to Affiliates   Related Party balance was $115,517 from Phoenix Northern Resort,
LLC and the Line of Credit   Related Part balance was $426,184 to Tempe Phoenix Airport Resort LLC. 

Management
and trademark fee revenue from related parties were approximately $208,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 as compared
to approximately $171,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2015.  

Besides
Pamela Barnhill, Vice Chairperson and President of the Trust and daughter of Mr. Wirth, the Trust s Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, the Trust also employs two other immediate family members of Mr. Wirth who provide technology and administrative support
services to the Trust, with each receiving a $47,500 yearly salary.  

Effective
May 1, 2016, we increased our management and trademark fee revenues by charging Mr. Wirth s hotels 5% of room revenues instead
of 3% of room revenues. The accounting fees collected remained constant at $2,000 per month per property. The Trust increased
its fees to keep up with market conditions as other management companies have steadily increased their fees. Management and trademark
fee revenues were approximately $208,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $171,000 for
the nine months ended October 31, 2015. For the three months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, we had management and
trademark fees income of approximately $70,000 and $43,000, respectively. We expect that management and trademark fee revenues
will continue to increase during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, offset by the loss of the management and trademark
fee revenues generated by Mr. Wirth and his affiliated hotel in Fort Worth, Texas, which was managed by the Trust and sold to
an independent third party during April 2015.

SALE OF OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES  

The
Trust has sold non-controlling interests in certain subsidiaries, including Albuquerque Suite Hospitality, LLC (the  Albuquerque
entity ), Tucson Hospitality Properties, LP (the  Tucson entity ), Ontario Hospitality Properties, LP (the  Ontario
entity ), and Yuma Hospitality Properties, Limited Partnership (the  Yuma entity ), which sales are described
in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016. Generally, interests have sold for $10,000 per
unit with a two-unit minimum subscription. The Trust or the Partnership maintains at least 50.1% of the units in each entity and
intends to maintain this minimum ownership percentage. Generally, the units in each of the entities are allocated to three classes
with differing cumulative discretionary priority distribution rights through a certain time period. Class A units are owned by
unrelated third parties and have first priority for distributions. Class B units are owned by the Trust and have second priority
for distributions. Class C units are owned by Rare Earth or other affiliates of Mr. Wirth and have the lowest priority for distributions.
Priority distributions of $700 per unit per year are cumulative until a certain date; however, after that date, generally Class
A unit holders continue to hold a preference on distributions over Class B and Class C unit holders. As of February 1, 2016, the
Trust no longer accrues for these distributions as the preference period generally has expired. During the nine months ended October
31, 2016, the priority distributions were paid for the six months ended July 31, 2016 and no priority distributions were accrued
for the three months ended October 31, 2016.  

During
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, there were no Class A, B or C units of the Albuquerque entity sold. As of October 31,
2016 and January 31, 2016, the Trust held a 50.91% ownership interest, or 279 Class B units, in the Albuquerque entity, Mr. Wirth
and his affiliates held a 0.18% interest, or 1 Class C unit, and other third parties held a 48.91% interest, or 268 Class A units.  

During
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, there were three Class A units of the Tucson entity sold at $10,000 per unit, which were
sold by Rare Earth. As of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016, the Partnership held a 51.01% ownership interest, or 404 Class
B units, in the Tucson entity, Mr. Wirth and his affiliates held a 0.38% interest, or 3 Class C units, and other parties held
a 48.61% interest, or 385 Class A units.  

During
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, there were thirty-two Class A units of the Ontario entity sold at $10,000 per unit, of
which two were sold by the Partnership and twenty-eight were sold by Rare Earth. As of October 31, 2016, the Partnership held
a 51.33% ownership interest, or 496 Class B units, in the Ontario entity, Mr. Wirth and his affiliates held a 0.21% interest through
Rare Earth, or 2 Class C units, and other parties held a 48.46% interest, or 468.25 Class A units.  

During
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, there were 9.5 Class A units of the Yuma entity sold, at $10,000 per unit, of which 5.5
Class C units were sold by the Trust and the remaining units were sold by Rare Earth. As of October 31, 2016, the Trust held a
50.24% ownership interest, or 401.90 Class B units, in the Yuma entity, Mr. Wirth and his affiliates held a 0.51% interest, or
4.10 Class C units, and other parties held a 49.25% interest, or 394 Class A units.  

7.
STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES  

The
Trust paid $569,952 and $608,135 in cash for interest for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
for continuing operations. The Trust paid $2,768 and $71,571 in cash for income taxes for the nine months ended October 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively, for continuing operations.  

8.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

The
Albuquerque Hotel is subject to a non-cancelable ground lease that expires in 2058. Total expense associated with the non-cancelable
ground lease for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $111,000 and $110,000, respectively.  

During
2010, the Trust entered into a five-year office lease for its corporate headquarters. On April 30, 2014, the lease was extended
for 36 months and expires in 2017. The Trust recorded approximately $24,000 and $21,000 of general and administrative expense
related to the lease during the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lease included a base rent charge
of $31,994 for the first lease year beginning in fiscal year 2014, with annual increases to a final year base rent of $34,120
for lease year ending in fiscal year 2017. The Trust has the option to cancel the lease after each lease year for penalties of
four months  rent after the first year with the penalty decreasing by one month s rent each successive lease year.
It is the Trust s intention to remain in the office for the duration of the lease period, as extended.  

Future
minimum lease payments under the non-cancelable ground leases and office lease are as follows:  

The
Trust is obligated under a loan agreement relating to the Tucson Oracle property to deposit 4% of the individual hotel s
room revenue into an escrow account to be used for capital expenditures. The escrow funds applicable to the Tucson Oracle property
for which a mortgage lender escrow exists are not reported on the Trust s Consolidated Balance Sheet as  Restricted
Cash  as the balance was $0 as of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016.  

InnSuites
Hotels has entered into membership agreements with Best Western International, Inc. ( Best Western ) with respect
to all four of the Hotels. In exchange for use of the Best Western name, trademark and reservation system, the participating Hotels
pay fees to Best Western based on reservations received through the use of the Best Western reservation system and the number
of available suites at the participating Hotels. The agreements with Best Western have no specific expiration terms and may be
cancelled by either party. Best Western requires that the participating hotels meet certain requirements for room quality, and
the Hotels are subject to removal from its reservation system if these requirements are not met. The Hotels with third-party membership
agreements received significant reservations through the Best Western reservation system. Under these arrangements, fees paid
for membership fees and reservations were approximately $252,000 and $248,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  

The
nature of the operations of the Hotels exposes them to risks of claims and litigation in the normal course of their business.
Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined and is covered by insurance, management does not expect that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations
or liquidity of the Trust.  

The
Trust is involved from time to time in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the
opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Trust s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  

9.
SEGMENT REPORTING  

In
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Trust determined that its reportable segments are the Hotel Operations   Corporate
Overhead and IBC Developments segments. Reportable segments are determined based on discrete financial information reviewed by
the Trust s CODM. The Trust organizes and reviews operations based on products and services, and currently there are no
operating segments that are aggregated. Consistent with the change in reportable segments, the Trust revised its prior period
financial information for the new segment structure. Historical financial information presented in this Form 10-Q reflects this
change.  

Information
relative to the Trust s reportable segments, for which there is no intersegment revenues, is as follows:  

10.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  

The
Trust has recognized the sale of the Tucson St. Mary s Suite Hospitality LLC (the  Tucson St. Mary s entity )
as discontinued operations. After the sale of this asset, the Trust incurred some additional minor expenses which are presented
below. Discontinued operations in the nine and three months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015 primarily consists of
the Tucson St. Mary s hotel operational revenues and expenses and does not include the sale proceeds and profit from the
sale of our Tucson St. Mary s hotel. Historical results of the Tucson St. Mary s hotel has been adjusted for comparability
purposes and exclude any corporate general and administrative expenses.  

On
August 1, 2015, the Trust finalized and committed to a plan to sell all the Hotel properties. As of May 1, 2016, the Trust has
listed all the Hotel properties with a local real estate hotel broker, and management believes that each of the assets is being
marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The Trust believes that the plan to sell these assets
will not be withdrawn. Through the Trust s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on September
14, 2016, the Trust classified all the Hotel properties as Assets Held for Sale. As of October 31, 2016, the Trust has decided
to reclassify these assets back into operations as many of these assets have been marketed for sale for more than one year. At
this time, the Trust is unable to predict when, and if, any of these Hotel properties will be sold and the Trust no longer deems
a sale to be probable. The Trust continues to list these properties with local real estate hotel brokers and, we believe, that
each of the assets is being marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. There have been no other
material changes to our basis of presentation since January 31, 2016.  

The
following financial information presents the consolidated balance sheets of the discontinued operations and assets held for sale
as of October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016, as well as the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months
ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

On
December 5, 2016, The Trust and the Partnership together entered into eight unsecured loans for a total of $425,000 with varying
principal amounts ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 with H. W. Hayes Trust ( Hayes Loans ). The Trust and the Partnership
together also entered into two unsecured on-demand $25,000 loans for a total of $50,000 with Lita M. Sweitzer ( Sweitzer
Loans ). The total principal amount of the Hayes Loans and the Sweitzer Loans is $475,000. The Hayes Loans and the Sweitzer
Loans are due on June 20, 2019 or on demand, whichever occurs first. The Hayes Loans requires from a 0-120 day notification of
the demand to repay the loans prior to June 20, 2019. Both the Hayes Loans and the Sweitzer Loans accrue interest at 7.0% per
year on the unpaid balance and interest only payments shall be made monthly and are due on the first of the following month. The
Trust and Partnership may pay all or part of these notes without any repayment penalties.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

GENERAL  

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes therein of our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016.  

Our
principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements, including distributions to our shareholders, is our share of the Partnership s
cash flow, quarterly distributions from the Albuquerque, New Mexico and Yuma, Arizona properties and more recently, sales of non-controlling
interests in our Hotels. The Partnership s principal source of cash flow is quarterly distributions from the Tucson, Arizona
and Ontario, California properties. Our liquidity, including our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, will depend
upon our ability and the Partnership s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations and to service our
debt. In addition, our management is analyzing other strategic options available to us, including the refinancing of another property
or raising additional funds through additional non-controlling interest sales; however, such transactions may not be available
on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.  

In
furtherance of our strategic plan, we have significantly expanded InnDependent Boutique Collection ( IBC Hotels ),
a wholly owned subsidiary of InnSuites Hospitality Trust, which has a network of approximately 6,500 members representing 170
countries and over 2,000,000 rooms and suites. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, IBC Hotels formed a marketing alliance
with the ILIA. We believe this new hotel network provides independent hotel owners a competitive advantage against traditional
franchised brands in their markets. The network provides a booking system and loyalty program. IBC Hotels charges a 10% - 20%
booking fee, which we believe increases the independent hotel profits. Competitors of IBC Hotels can charge anywhere from a 30%
to 50% booking fee. InnDependent InnCentives, IBC s loyalty program, allows hoteliers to benefit from guests who frequently
stay at IBC independent hotels. IBC Hotels is dedicated to providing guests with a unique, non-cookie cutter hotel experience
in addition to providing value-added amenities and resort locations to its guests. IBC Hotels has an InnDependent InnCentives
travel rewards program that provides a free stay at any worldwide IBC Hotel of the guests  choice after booking 12 nights
on IBC Hotels  website. In addition, on January 8, 2016, IBC Hotels purchased substantially all of the assets of International
Vacation Hotels, a technology company located in Dallas, Texas, which provides reservation services to over 600 independent international
hotels. For more information about the acquisition of International Vacation Hotels, see Note 27 of our Consolidated Financial
Statements    Acquisition of International Vacation Hotels  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K Annual Report
filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016 for the period ended January 31, 2016.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

In
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016, we identified
the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our condensed consolidated
financial statements. We believe that the policies we follow for the valuation of our Hotel properties, which constitute the majority
of our assets, are our most critical policies. Those policies include methods used to recognize and measure any identified impairment
of our Hotel property assets.  

On
August 1, 2015, the Trust finalized and committed to a plan to sell all the hotel properties. As of May 1, 2016, the Trust has
listed all the Hotel properties with a local real estate hotel broker, and management believes that each of the assets is being
marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. The Trust believes that the plan to sell these assets
will not be withdrawn. Through the Trust s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on September
14, 2016, the Trust classified all the Hotel properties as Assets Held for Sale. As of October 31, 2016, the Trust has decided
to reclassify these assets back into operations as many of these assets have been marketed for sale for more than one year. At
this time, the Trust is unable to predict when, and if, any of these Hotel properties will be sold. The Trust continues to list
these properties with local real estate hotel brokers, and we believe that each of the assets is being marketed at a price that
is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. There have been no other material changes to our critical accounting policies
and estimates since January 31, 2016.  

HOTEL
PROPERTIES  

Our
long-term strategic plan is to obtain the full benefit of our real estate equity and to migrate our focus from a hotel owner to
a hospitality service company by expanding our trademark license, management, reservation and advertising services, through IBC
Hotels, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Trust. As of October 31, 2016, IBC Hotels provided services to approximately 6,500 hotels.  

We
are planning significant expansion of IBC Hotels during the next couple of fiscal years as we concentrate our sales and marketing
efforts towards consumers. We anticipate the IBC Hotels sales and marketing efforts to increase our revenues and decrease our
consolidated net loss over the next couple of fiscal years. For each reservation, IBC Hotels receives a 10% - 20% transactional
fee plus reimbursement of our credit card processing fees associated with the reservation. We cannot provide any assurance that
our plans will be successful or in line with our expectations.  

This
plan is similar to strategies followed by internationally diversified hotel industry leaders, which over the last several years
have reduced real estate holdings and concentrated on hospitality services. We began our long-term corporate strategy when we
relinquished our REIT income tax status in January 2004, which had previously prevented us from providing management services
to hotels. In June 2004, we acquired our trademark license and management agreements and began providing management, trademark
and reservations services to our Hotels.  

We
expect to use proceeds from the sale of the Hotels, if any, as needed to support hospitality service operations as cash flow from
current operations, primarily the rental of hotel rooms, declines with the sale of the Hotels.  

The
tables below provide book values, mortgage balances and listed asking price for the Hotels as of October 31, 2016.  

The
listed asking price is the amount at which we would sell each of the Hotels and is based on the original listed selling price
adjusted to reflect recent hotel sales in the Hotels  areas of operation and current earnings of each of the Hotels. The
listed asking price is not based on appraisals of the properties.  

We
may be unable to realize the listed sales price for the individual Hotel properties or to sell them at all. However, we believe
that the listed values are reasonable based on local market conditions and comparable sales. Changes in market conditions have
in part resulted, and may in the future result, in our changing one or all of the listed asking prices.  

NON-GAAP
FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The
following non-GAAP presentations of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and
funds from operations ( FFO ) are made to assist our investors in evaluating our operating performance.  

Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as earnings before minority interest, interest expense, amortization of loan costs, interest income, income
taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-controlling interests in the Trust. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe
these measurements (a) more accurately reflect the ongoing performance of our hotel assets and other investments, (b) provide
more useful information to investors as indicators of our ability to meet our future debt payment and working capital requirements
and (c) provide an overall evaluation of our financial condition. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to critically evaluate each
of the hotels  financial and operational performance and uses Adjusted EBITDA for trending and comparability analysis. Adjusted
EBITDA as calculated by us may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA reported by other companies that do not define Adjusted EBITDA
exactly as we define the term. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance
with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to (a) GAAP net income or loss as an indication of our financial performance
or (b) GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.  

A
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss attributable to controlling interests for the nine and three months ended October
31, 2016 and 2015 follows:  

FFO
is calculated on the basis defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), which
is net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses on sales of properties, asset impairment adjustments,
and extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated joint ventures and non-controlling interests in the operating partnership. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure
of performance of an equity REIT to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis
determined by GAAP. The Trust is an unincorporated Ohio real estate investment trust; however, the Trust is not a real estate
investment trust for federal taxation purposes. Management uses this measurement to compare itself to REITs with similar depreciable
assets. We consider FFO to be an appropriate measure of our ongoing normalized operating performance. We compute FFO in accordance
with our interpretation of standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other companies that
either do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or interpret the NAREIT definition differently
than us. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as
an alternative to (a) GAAP net income or loss as an indication of our financial performance or (b) GAAP cash flows from operating
activities as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability
to make cash distributions. However, to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, we believe that
FFO should be considered along with our net income or loss and cash flows reported in the consolidated financial statements.  

A
reconciliation of FFO to net loss attributable to controlling interests for the nine and three months ended October 31, 2016 and
2015 follows:  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS  

Our
operating expenses from continuing operations consist primarily of property taxes, insurance, corporate overhead, professional
fees, depreciation of the Hotels and hotel operating expenses. Hotel operating expenses consist primarily of payroll, guest and
maintenance supplies, repairs and maintenance marketing and utilities expenses. Under the terms of its Partnership Agreement,
the Partnership is required to reimburse us for all such expenses. Accordingly, management believes that a review of the historical
performance of the operations of the Hotels, particularly with respect to occupancy, which is calculated as rooms sold divided
by total rooms available, average daily rate ( ADR ), calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms
sold, and revenue per available room ( REVPAR ), calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available,
is appropriate for understanding revenue from the Hotels. REVPAR is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate
hotel operations. We also use REVPAR to compare the results of our Hotels between periods. In the nine months of fiscal year 2017,
occupancy increased 1.29% to 75.35% from 74.06% in the nine months of the prior fiscal year. ADR increased by $4.70, or 6.6%,
to $75.38 during the nine months of fiscal year 2017 from $70.68 in the nine months of fiscal year 2016. The increase in occupancy
and the significantly increased ADR resulted in an increase in REVPAR of $4.34, or 8.26%, to $56.88 in the nine months of fiscal
year 2017 from $52.54 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2016. After our remodel of our Ontario, California property during
fiscal year 2016, the property had significant increased occupancy and ADR, resulting in an increase in REVPAR. These increases
were offset by continued pressures in our Tucson, Arizona and Albuquerque, New Mexico markets. We anticipate that our Ontario,
California property will outperform our fiscal year 2016 results while our other properties will face continued pressures during
the remainder of fiscal year 2017.  

Overall,
we continue to focus on REVPAR and monitor each of our markets on a weekly basis. We continue to look for opportunities to replace
our government business in our Yuma, Arizona property, and we anticipate focusing our capital improvements efforts in our Tucson,
Arizona property during the remainder of fiscal year 2017.  

The
following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated:  

No
assurance can be given that occupancy, ADR and REVPAR will not increase or decrease as a result of changes in national or local
economic or hospitality industry conditions or other factors.

A
summary of total operating results of the Trust for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

Our
overall results for the nine months of fiscal year 2017 were negatively affected by the losses incurred in our growing IBC Hotels
division and our increased room revenues generated by our hotel properties, offset by additional operating expenses from continuing
operations. See below for discussion of operating results by segment.  

The
Trust has the following two segments: Hotel Operations   Corporate Overhead and IBC Developments. For comparability purposes,
Hotel Operations   Corporate Overhead below excludes Discontinued Operations. A summary of operating results by segment for
the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

CONSOLIDATED
NET LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAX PROVISION AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE NINE
MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2015  

We
had a consolidated net loss before income tax provision and discontinued operations of approximately $2,114,000 for the nine months
ended October 31, 2016, compared to approximately $1,035,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2015. For the nine months ended
October 31, 2016, after deducting income tax provision of approximately $3,000, and after deducting net loss from discontinued
operations, net of non-controlling interest, of approximately $17,000, the consolidated net loss was approximately $2,134,000.
For the nine months ended October 31, 2015, after deducting income tax provision of approximately $72,000 and deducting net loss
from discontinued operations, net of non-controlling interest, of approximately $479,000 and adding the gain on disposal of discontinued
operations of approximately $2,352,000, the consolidated net income was approximately $767,000. This decrease of approximately
$2,901,000 from the nine months of fiscal year 2017 as compared to the nine months of fiscal year 2016 was attributable to increased
operating losses during the nine months of fiscal year 2017, the losses attributable to our investment in IBC Hotels and the gain
on disposal of discontinued operations during our fiscal year 2016.

summary of total operating results of the Trust for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:  

Our
overall results for the three months ended October 31, 2016 were positively affected by an increase in revenues from our growing
IBC Hotels division and our hotel properties, offset by additional operating expenses from continuing operations. See below for
discussion of operating results by segment.  

The
Trust has the following two segments: Hotel Operations   Corporate Overhead and IBC Developments. For comparability purposes,

CONSOLIDATED
NET LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAX PROVISION AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE
MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2015 

We
had a consolidated net loss before income tax provision and discontinued operations of approximately $1,879,000 for the three
months ended October 31, 2016, compared to approximately $479,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2015. After subtracting
income tax provision of approximately $3,000 and after deducting net loss from discontinued operations, net of non-controlling
interest, of approximately $85, consolidated net loss was approximately $1,881,000 for the three months ended October 31,
2016. After subtracting net loss from discontinued operations of approximately $535,000 and adding the gain from disposal of discontinued
operations of approximately $2,352,000, consolidated net income was approximately $1,338,000 for the three months ended October
31, 2015. The Trust had a decrease of approximately $3,219,000 of consolidated net income for the three months ended October 31,
2016 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015. This decrease was attributable to significant improvement in net
income, offset by the increased investment of our IBC Developments segment. After removing net loss attributable to non-controlling
interest of approximately $642,000 and approximately $39,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
net loss attributable to controlling interests was approximately $1,239,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and net
gain attributable to controlling interests was approximately $1,377,000 for the three months ending October 31, 2015.

TO THE NINE MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2015  

Hotel
Operations   Corporate Overhead Segment excluding Discontinued Operations    

For
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, we had total revenue from continuing operations for this segment of approximately $9,377,000
compared to approximately $8,667,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $710,000 or approximately
8.2%. For the three months ended October 31, 2016, we had total revenue from continued operations for this segment of approximately
$3,031,000 compared to approximately $2,548,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $483,000,
or approximately 19.0%. These increased revenues were primarily generated by the increased revenues at our newly renovated hotel
property located in Ontario, California.  

For
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, we had total room revenue of approximately $8,977,000 compared to approximately $8,262,000
for the nine months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $715,000. With an extensive remodel at our Ontario, California
property, we realized an overall increase of 8.7% in total room revenues during the nine months of fiscal year 2017 as total revenues
for our Ontario, California property increased significantly but were offset by a decrease in room revenues in our Tucson, Arizona
hotel property.  

For
the three months ended October 31, 2016, we had room revenue of approximately $2,908,000 compared to approximately $2,457,000
for the three months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $451,000. With an extensive remodel at our Ontario,
California property, we realized an overall 18.4% increase in room revenues during the three months ended October 31, 2016 as
revenues significantly increased at our Ontario, California property but were offset by decreases in revenues in our Tucson, Arizona
hotel property and our Albuquerque, New Mexico hotel property.  

Food
and beverage revenue was approximately $151,000 for the nine months of fiscal year 2017 as compared to approximately $120,000
for the nine months of fiscal year 2016, an increase of approximately $31,000. Food and beverage revenue increased approximately
$15,000 from approximately $30,000 during the three months ended October 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $45,000 during
the three months ended October 31, 2016. With increased occupancy at our Ontario, California property, we realized additional
food and beverage revenues which we anticipate will continue through the remainder of fiscal year 2017.  

We
also realized a decrease in other revenues during the nine months of fiscal year 2017 as other revenues were approximately $70,000
during the nine months of fiscal year 2016 as compared to approximately $38,000 during the nine months of fiscal year 2017. For
the three months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, other revenues were approximately $8,000 and $18,000, respectively.
Other revenues are variable and not predicable and include laundry, gift shop, park n  fly, pet fees and vending fees. During
the remainder of fiscal year 2017, we expect other revenues to remain constant.  

Effective
May 1, 2016, we increased our management and trademark fee revenues by charging Mr. Wirth s hotels 5% of room revenues instead
of 3% of room revenues. The accounting fees collected remained constant at $2,000 per month per property. The Trust increased
its fees to keep up with market conditions as other management companies have steadily increased their fees. Management and trademark
fee revenues were approximately $208,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $171,000 for
the nine months ended October 31, 2015. For the three months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, we had management and
trademark fees income of approximately $70,000 and $43,000, respectively. We expect that management and trademark fee revenues
will continue to increase during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, offset by the loss of the management and trademark
fee revenues generated by Mr. Wirth and his affiliated hotel in Fort Worth, Texas, which was managed by the Trust and sold to
an independent third party during April 2015.  

IBC
Developments Segment    

For
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, we had total revenue for this segment of approximately $522,000 as compared to approximately
$143,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $379,000. In January 2016, IBC Hotels purchased
International Vacation Hotels, which is included in the fiscal year 2017 growth of the IBC Development segment. International
Vacation Hotels revenues for the nine month ended October 31, 2016 were $292,000.  

For
the three months ended October 31, 2016, we had total revenue for this segment of approximately $126,000 as compared to approximately
$13,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $113,000. The growth in revenues came from International
Vacation Hotels and IBC Hotels.  

We
anticipate strong growth in this segment over the next several fiscal years but can provide no assurances regarding such growth.

ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $378,000 due to our continued significant investment in IBC Hotels.  

We
anticipate strong growth in this segment over the next several fiscal years but can provide no assurances regarding such growth.
We purchased International Vacation Hotels in January 2016. During fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, our expenses
for this segment increased.  

EXPENSES
EXCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2015  

Total
Expenses Excluding Discontinued Operations   

Total
operating expenses of approximately $11,480,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 reflect an increase of approximately
$2,243,000 compared to total operating expenses of approximately $9,237,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2015. The increase
was primarily due to an increase in depreciation, room, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses.  

Room
expenses, consisting of salaries and related employment taxes for property management, front office, housekeeping personnel, reservation
fees and room supplies, were approximately $2,716,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to approximately
$2,483,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $233,000, or 9.4%. Additional room expenses
were incurred during the nine months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2015 as our occupancy
significantly increased at our Ontario, California property. We anticipate continued growth at our Ontario, California property
based on our recent significant property improvements and drop in occupancy at our Tucson, Arizona property.  

Food
and beverage expenses included food and beverage costs, personnel and miscellaneous costs to provide banquet events. For the nine
months ended October 31, 2016, food and beverage expenses were approximately $247,000 as compared to approximately $219,000 for
the nine months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $28,000, or 12.8%. The increase during the nine months ended
October 31, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2015 primarily corresponded with our food and beverage operations
at our Ontario, California property. This increase in food and beverage expenses corresponded to the increased food and beverage
revenues. We anticipate that our food and beverage operations at our Ontario, California property will remain steady for the remaining
portion of fiscal year 2017.  

General
and administrative expenses were approximately $3,232,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, an increase of approximately
$746,000 from the general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2015 of approximately $2,503,000 due
to the payout of bonuses to the officers of the Trust during the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2017 and our continued investment
in IBC Hotels. Management continues to explore and look for general and administrative cost cutting opportunities.  

Sales
and Marketing expenses were approximately $1,135,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, an increase of approximately
$305,000 from the sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2015 of approximately $831,000 due to our
continued investment in IBC hotels.  

Depreciation
expense was approximately $1,673,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, a increase of approximately $869,000 from depreciation
expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2015 of approximately $804,000. On August 1, 2015, the Trust finalized and committed
to a plan to sell all the Hotel properties. Accordingly, the Trust has listed all the Hotel properties with a local real estate
hotel broker, and management believes that each of the assets is being marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to its
current fair value. The Trust believes that the plan to sell these assets will not be withdrawn. Through the Trust s Form
10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on September 14, 2016, the Trust classified all the Hotel properties
as Assets Held for Sale. As of October 31, 2016, the Trust has decided to reclassify these assets back into operations as many
of these assets have been marketed for sale for more than one year. At this time, the Trust is unable to predict when, and if,
any of these Hotel properties will be sold and the Trust no longer deems a sale to be probable. The Trust continues to list these
properties with local real estate hotel brokers and, we believe, that each of the assets is being marketed at a price that is
reasonable in relation to its current fair value. There have been no other material changes to our basis of presentation since
January 31, 2016.  

Depreciation
expenses were recaptured and included in the accounting books as of October 31, 2016. During the three months ended October 31,
2016, approximately $1,511,000 of depreciation expenses were included in our operating results.  

Interest
expenses were approximately $570,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $38,000 from the
interest expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2015 of approximately $608,000.  

EXPENSES
EXCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2015  

Total
Expenses Excluding Discontinued Operations   

Total
operating expenses of approximately $4,841,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 reflect an increase of approximately
$1,992,000 as compared to total operating expenses of approximately $2,849,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2015. The
increase was primarily due to increases in depreciation and room, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses
as described further below.  

Room
expenses, consisting of salaries and related employment taxes for property management, front office, housekeeping personnel, reservation
fees and room supplies, were approximately $925,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $806,000
for the three months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $118,000, or 14.6%. Additional room expenses were incurred
during the three months ended October 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015 as our occupancy increased
at our Ontario, California property, offset by an occupancy decrease at our Tucson, Arizona property. We anticipate continued
growth at our Ontario, California property based on our recent significant property improvements and decreased but steady occupancy
at our Tucson, Arizona property.  

Food
and beverage expenses included food and beverage costs, personnel and miscellaneous costs to provide banquet events. For the three
months ended October 31, 2016, food and beverage expenses were approximately $81,000 as compared to approximately $74,000 for
the three months ended October 31, 2015, an increase of approximately $7,000, or 9.0%. Management continues to explore and look
for food and beverage cost cutting opportunities, especially at our Tucson, Arizona property.  

General
and Administrative expenses were approximately $1,052,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016, an increase of approximately
$282,000 from the general and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2015 of approximately $770,000 due
to our continued investment in IBC Hotels. Management continues to explore and look for general and administrative cost cutting
opportunities.  

Sales
and Marketing expenses were approximately $446,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $164,000
from the sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2015 of approximately $282,000 due to our continued
investment in IBC hotels.  

Depreciation
expense was approximately $1,511,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $1,388,000 from
depreciation expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2015 of approximately $123,000. On August 1, 2015, the Trust finalized
and committed to a plan to sell all the Hotel properties. As of May 1, 2016, the Trust has listed all the Hotel properties with
a local real estate hotel broker, and management believes that each of the assets is being marketed at a price that is reasonable
in relation to its current fair value. The Trust believes that the plan to sell these assets will not be withdrawn. Through the
Trust s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on September 14, 2016, the Trust classified all
the Hotel properties as Assets Held for Sale. As of October 31, 2016, the Trust has decided to reclassify these assets back into
operations as many of these assets have been marketed for sale for more than one year. Depreciation expenses were recaptured and
included in the accounting books as of October 31, 2016.  

Utilities
expenses were approximately $222,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $2,000 from the
utilities expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2015 of approximately $220,000. Our Ontario, California property has
higher utility rates and increased occupancy levels during the three month ended October 31, 2016 as compared to occupancy levels
during the three months ended October 31, 2015.  

Interest
expenses were approximately $195,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $3,000 from the
interest expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2015 of approximately $192,000. The expenses are fairly consistent and
we anticipate interest expenses will remain consistent through the rest of this fiscal year.  

DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS  

Hotel
Operations   Corporate Overhead Segment   Only Discontinued Operations   

As
our Tucson St. Mary s hotel was sold to an unrelated third party on October 14, 2015, no revenues and approximately $100
and $17,000 of general and administrative expenses were recorded for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2016, respectively.
These one-time general and administrative expenses consisted of property management bonuses and uncollectable accounts receivables.
The Trust does not anticipate any additional significant expenses for the dissolution of this asset.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Our principal source of
cash to meet our cash requirements, including distributions to our shareholders, is our share of the Partnership s cash flow,
quarterly distributions from the Albuquerque, New Mexico and Yuma, Arizona properties and, more recently, sales of non-controlling
interests in our Hotels. The Partnership s principal source of cash flow is quarterly distributions from the Tucson, Arizona
property and Ontario, California property. Our liquidity, including our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, will
depend upon our ability and the Partnership s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations and sales of
non-controlling interests to service our debt. 

As of October 31, 2016,
the Trust had a related party Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note with an amount payable of approximately $0. The
Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note has a maximum borrowing capacity to $1,000,000, which is available through December
31, 2017. As of December 12, 2016, the outstanding net balance receivable on the Demand/Revolving Line of Credit/Promissory Note
was $0. 

As of October 31, 2016,
the Trust had two available Advances to Affiliate credit facilities each with a maximum borrowing capacity of $500,000 for a total
maximum borrowing capacity of $1,000,000. As of October 31, 2016, the Trust had an amount payable of approximately $426,000 on
one of the Advances to Affiliates credit facility and an amount receivable of approximately $116,000 on the other Advances to
Affiliates credit facility. 

Both the Demand/Revolving
Line of Credit/Promissory Note and the Advances to Affiliate credit facilities accrues interest at 7.0% per annum and requires
interest only payments quarterly. 

With approximately
$496,000 of cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2016 and the availability of a $1,000,000 related party Demand/Revolving
Line of Credit/Promissory Note, $1,000,000 Advances to Affiliates credit facilities and the availability of the two unsecured
loans of $475,000 provided on December 2, 2016, we believe that we will have enough cash on hand to meet all of our financial
obligations as they become due for at least the next year. In addition, our management is analyzing other strategic options available
to us, including the refinancing of another property or raising additional funds through additional non-controlling interest sales;
however, such transactions may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. 

There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in obtaining extensions, refinancing debt or raising additional or replacement funds, or that these
funds may be available on terms that are favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional or replacement funds, we may be
required to sell certain of our assets to meet our liquidity needs, which may not be on terms that are favorable. 

We expect the major challenge
for the remaining portion of fiscal year 2017 is the continuation of strong competition for corporate leisure group and government
business in the markets in which we operate, which may affect our ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share. 

Net cash used in operating
activities totaled approximately ($813,000) and approximately ($400,000) for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and
October 31, 2015, respectively. Refer to the discussion below for the change in the net cash used in operating activities. 

Consolidated net income
(loss) was approximately ($2,134,000) and $767,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The differences
in consolidated net loss for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and the consolidated net income for the nine months ended October
31, 2015 are explained above in   Results of  Operations.  

Changes in the adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for the nine months
ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, consist primarily of changes in the hotel property depreciation of approximately
$1,673,000 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 compared with approximately $1,037,000 for the nine months ended October
31, 2015, gain on disposal of assets of approximately $2,352,000 during the nine months ended October 31, 2015, cumulative changes
in assets and liabilities for accounts receivables of approximately ($208,000) and approximately $304,000 for the nine months ended
October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately ($280,000) and approximately
($311,000) for the nine months October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These changes resulted in net cash used in operating activities
of approximately ($813,000) and approximately ($400,000) for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, respectively.
Hotel depreciation increased significantly during the nine months ended October 31, 2016 compared with the nine months ended October
31, 2015, as all our hotels were included in discontinued operations and assets held for sale and depreciation was halted during
part of the nine months ended October 31, 2015 but caught up during the nine months ended October 31, 2016. Significant additional
accounts receivables were generated during the nine months ended October 31, 2016 from our IBC Developments segment which the Trust
expects to collect during the three months ended January 31, 2016. 

Net
cash provided by (used in) investing activities was approximately ($986,000) and $3,397,000 for the nine months ended October
31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to our additional
improvements and additions to our hotel properties, offset by our collections of advances to affiliates   related party,
during the nine months ended October 31, 2016. We also received proceeds from the sale of hotel property during the nine months
ended October 31, 2015, which did not occur during the nine months ended October 31, 2016.  

Net
cash provided by (used in) financing activities totaled approximately $338,000 and ($440,000) for the nine months ended
October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to decreased
payments on notes payables to banks, line of credit   related party, and other notes payable and decreased distributions
to non-controlling interest holders, as offset by decreased borrowings on notes payable to banks and line of credit-related party
and decreased proceeds from the sale of stock.  

We
continue to contribute to a Capital Expenditures Fund (the  Fund ) an amount equal to 4% of the InnSuites Hotels 
revenues from operation of the Hotels. The Fund is restricted by the mortgage lender for one of our properties. As of October
31, 2016, there were no monies held in these accounts, which are usually reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as  Restricted
Cash.  The Fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the Hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture,
fixtures, and equipment. During the nine months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the Hotels and Corporate office spent approximately
$1,843,000 and $1,317,000, respectively, for capital expenditures. We consider the majority of these improvements to be revenue
producing. Therefore, these amounts are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. For fiscal year 2017 capital
expenditures, we plan on spending more than we did during fiscal year 2016. During fiscal year 2016, we spent approximately $2,126,000
of capital expenditures. Repairs and maintenance of approximately $738,000 and $765,000 were charged to expense as incurred for
nine months ending October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

We
have minimum debt payments of approximately $231,000 and approximately $1,819,000 due during fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year
2018, respectively. Minimum debt payments due during the remainder of fiscal year 2017 include approximately $156,000 of mortgage
notes payable.  

As
of October 31, 2016, we had mortgage notes payable, net of discounts, of approximately $13,439,000 outstanding with respect to
the Hotels, approximately $427,000 in an unsecured non-revolving note payable, approximately $924,000 in an unsecured business
loan, approximately $318,000 in an unsecured revolving note payable, approximately $135,000 in an unsecured promissory note to
a unrelated party and approximately $13,000 of secured promissory notes outstanding to unrelated third parties arising from the
Shares of Beneficial Interest and Partnership unit repurchases.  

We
may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments. Any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured
or unsecured, long-term, medium-term or short-term, bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms
as we consider prudent.  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

Other
than lease commitments and legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business, we do not have any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements or liabilities. We do not have any majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries that are not included in our
consolidated financial statements.  

SEASONALITY  

The
Hotels  operations historically have been somewhat seasonal. The two southern Arizona hotels experience their highest occupancy
in the first fiscal quarter and, to a lesser extent, the fourth fiscal quarter. The second fiscal quarter tends to be the lowest
occupancy period at those two southern Arizona hotels. This seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in the Trust s
quarterly revenues. The two hotels located in California and New Mexico historically experience their most profitable periods
during the second and third fiscal quarters (the summer season), providing some balance to the general seasonality of the Trust s
hotel business.  

The
seasonal nature of the Trust s business increases its vulnerability to risks such as labor force shortages and cash flow
issues. Further, if an adverse event such as an actual or threatened terrorist attack, international conflict, data breach, regional
economic downturn or poor weather conditions should occur during the first or fourth fiscal quarters, the adverse impact to the
Trust s revenues could likely be greater as a result of its southern Arizona seasonal business.  

It
is too early to determine what the seasonality of the IBC segment is. The Trust does not anticipate much seasonality due to the
diversification of the location of the IBC Hotels.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), means
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company
in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2016.  

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

On
January 2, 2001, the Board of Trustees approved a share repurchase program under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, for the purchase of up to 250,000 Partnership units and/or Shares of Beneficial Interest in open market or privately
negotiated transactions. On September 10, 2002, August 18, 2005 and September 10, 2007, the Board of Trustees approved the purchase
of up to 350,000 additional Partnership units and/or Shares of Beneficial Interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions.
Additionally, on January 5, 2009, September 15, 2009 and January 31, 2010, the Board of Trustees approved the purchase of up to
300,000, 250,000 and 350,000, respectively, additional Partnership units and/or Shares of Beneficial Interest in open market or
privately negotiated transactions. Acquired Shares of Beneficial Interest will be held in treasury and will be available for future
acquisitions and financings and/or for awards granted under the InnSuites Hospitality Trust 1997 Stock Incentive and Option Plan.
During the three months ended October 31, 2016, the Trust acquired 9,213 Shares of Beneficial Interest in open market transactions
at an average price of $2.46 per share. The average price paid includes brokerage commissions. The Trust intends to continue repurchasing
Shares of Beneficial Interest in compliance with applicable legal and NYSE MKT requirements. The Trust remains authorized to repurchase
an additional 76,507 Partnership units and/or Shares of Beneficial Interest pursuant to the publicly announced share repurchase
program, which has no expiration date.

On
November 11, 2016, the Board of Trustees (the  Board ) of the Trust determined that the Trust s 2016 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders (the  2016 Annual Meeting ) will be held on January 24, 2017 at the Trust s corporate
offices located at 1625 E. Northern Avenue, Suite # 105, Phoenix, Arizona 85020, at 10 a.m., local time. The record date for determining
shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the 2016 Annual Meeting was set as December 12, 2016.  

As
previously announced on a Form 8-K, because the 2016 Annual Meeting will be held more than 30 days after the anniversary of the
2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, any shareholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in the Trust s proxy materials
for the 2016 Annual Meeting had to be submitted to the Trust a reasonable time before we begin to print and send proxy materials
(that is, no later than November 22, 2016). For the 2016 Annual Meeting, any proposal that a shareholder desires to present at
the 2016 Annual Meeting, but is not submitted for inclusion in the Trust s proxy materials, had to be submitted to the Trust
a reasonable time before we send the proxy materials (that is, no later than November 25, 2016).
