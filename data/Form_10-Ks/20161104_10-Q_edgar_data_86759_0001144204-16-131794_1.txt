NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein
have been prepared by Santa Fe Financial Corporation ( Santa Fe  or the  Company ), without audit, according
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP)
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes the disclosures that are made
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Further, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect,
in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which included only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement
of the financial position, cash flows and results of operations as of and for the periods indicated. It is suggested that these
financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of Santa Fe and the notes therein included in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. The June 30, 2016 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet
was derived from the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

The results of operations for the three months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. 

Santa Fe Financial Corporation, a Nevada corporation, ( Santa
Fe  or the  Company ) owns approximately 68.8% of the outstanding common shares of Portsmouth Square, Inc. ( Portsmouth ),
a public company. Santa Fe is an 81.7%-owned subsidiary of The InterGroup Corporation ( InterGroup ), a public company.
InterGroup also directly owns approximately 13.3% of the common stock of Portsmouth, a public company. 

Portsmouth s primary
business is conducted through its general and limited partnership interest in Justice Investors, a California limited partnership
( Justice  or the  Partnership ).  Portsmouth controls approximately 93% of the voting interest in
Justice and is the sole general partner. 

Justice, through its subsidiaries Justice Holdings Company,
LLC ( Holdings ), a Delaware Limited Liability Company, Justice Operating Company, LLC ( Operating ) and
Justice Mezzanine Company, LLC ( Mezzanine ), owns a 543-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco
California, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the  Hotel ) and related facilities including a five
level underground parking garage. Holdings and Mezzanine are both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership; Operating is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Mezzanine. Mezzanine is the borrower under certain mezzanine indebtedness of Justice, and in December
2013, the Partnership conveyed ownership of the Hotel to Operating. The Hotel is operated by the partnership as a full service
Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with HLT Franchise Holding LLC (Hilton). Justice has a management
agreement with Prism Hospitality L.P. ( Prism ) to perform certain management functions for the Hotel. The management
agreement with Prism had an original term of ten years, subject to the Partnership s right to terminate at any time with
or without cause. Effective January 2014, the management agreement with Prism was amended by the Partnership to change the nature
of the services provided by Prism and the compensation payable to Prism, among other things. Effective December 1, 2013, GMP Management,
Inc. ( GMP ), a company owned by a Justice limited partner and a related party, also provided management services for
the Partnership pursuant to a management services agreement, with a three year term, subject to the Partnership s right to
terminate earlier for cause. In June 2016, GMP resigned and the Company is currently interviewing several national third party
hotel management companies to replace GMP. 

The parking garage that is part of the Hotel property was managed
by Ace Parking pursuant to a contract with the Partnership. The contract was terminated with an effective termination date of October
4, 2016. The Company began managing the parking garage in-house after the termination of Ace Parking. 

Management believes that the revenues expected to be generated
from the operations of the hotel, garage and leases will be sufficient to meet all of the Partnership s current and future
obligations and financial requirements. 

In addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also
generates income from the ownership and management of real estate. On December 31, 1997, the Company acquired a controlling 55.4%
interest in Intergroup Woodland Village, Inc. ( Woodland Village ) from InterGroup. Woodland Village's major asset is
a 27-unit apartment complex located in Los Angeles, California. The Company also owns a two-unit apartment building in Los Angeles,
California. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments .  This ASU modifies the
impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result
in the more timely recognition of losses. ASU No. 2016-13 will be effective for us as of January 1, 2020. The Company is currently
reviewing the effect of ASU No. 2016-13. 

On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement
of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic230) .  This ASU is intended to reduce
the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted
ASU No. 2016-15 in the first quarter of 2017 with no material impact to our financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented
in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual
and interim periods within these annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early application is permitted. This standard
did not have material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted this standard during
the quarter and reclassified the debt issuance costs on the June 30, 2016 consolidated balance sheet.

Investment in hotel consisted of the following as of: 

NOTE 3   INVESTMENT IN REAL ESTATE, NET  

The Company owns and operates a 27-unit and 2-unit multi-family
apartment complex located in Los Angeles, California and owns land held for development located in Maui, Hawaii. Investment in
real estate consisted of the following: 

NOTE 4 - INVESTMENT IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES  

The Company s investment
in marketable securities consists primarily of corporate equities. The Company has also periodically invested in corporate bonds
and income producing securities, which may include interests in real estate based companies and REITs, where financial benefit
could transfer to its shareholders through income and/or capital gain.   

At September 30, 2016
and June 30, 2016, all of the Company s marketable securities are classified as trading securities. The change in the unrealized
gains and losses on these investments are included in earnings. Trading securities are summarized as follows:  

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, approximately 64%
and 74%, respectively, of the investment marketable securities balance above is comprised of the common stock of Comstock Mining,
Inc. 

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had
$1,814,000 and $1,770,000, respectively, of unrealized losses related to securities held for over one year. 

Net loss on marketable securities on the statement of operations
is comprised of realized and unrealized gains (losses). Below is the composition of the two components for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 5   OTHER INVESTMENTS, NET  

The Company may also invest, with the approval of the Securities
Investment Committee and other Company guidelines, in private investment equity funds and other unlisted securities, such as convertible
notes through private placements. Those investments in non-marketable securities are carried at cost on the Company s balance
sheet as part of other investments, net of other than temporary impairment losses. 

 Other investments, net consist of the following: 

NOTE 6 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

The carrying values of the Company s financial instruments
not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis approximate fair value due to their short maturities (i.e., accounts
receivable, other assets, accounts payable and other liabilities) or the nature and terms of the obligation (i.e., other notes
payable and mortgage notes payable). 

The assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as
follows: 

The fair values of investments in marketable securities are
determined by the most recently traded price of each security at the balance sheet date. 

Financial assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis and are not included in the tables above include  Other investments, net (non-marketable securities),  that were
initially measured at cost and have been written down to fair value as a result of impairment or adjusted to record the fair value
of new instruments received (i.e., preferred shares) in exchange for old instruments (i.e., debt instruments). The following table
shows the fair value hierarchy for these assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as follows: 

Other investments in non-marketable securities are carried at cost net of any impairment loss. The Company has no significant influence
or control over the entities that issue these investments and holds less than 20% ownership in each of the investments. These investments
are reviewed on a periodic basis for other-than-temporary impairment. The Company reviews several factors to determine whether
a loss is other-than-temporary. These factors include but are not limited to: (i) the length of time an investment is in an unrealized
loss position, (ii) the extent to which fair value is less than cost, (iii) the financial condition and near term prospects of
the issuer and (iv) our ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
fair value. 

NOTE 7   SEGMENT INFORMATION  

The Company operates in four reportable segments, the operation
of the hotel ( Hotel Operations ), its multi-family residential properties ( Real Estate Operations) and the
investment of its cash in marketable securities and other investments ( Investment Transactions ). These three operating
segments, as presented in the financial statements, reflect how management internally reviews each segment s performance.
Management also makes operational and strategic decisions based on this same information. Information below represents reporting
segments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating income for rental properties consist of
rental income. Operating income from hotel operations consists of the operation of the hotel and operation of the garage. Income
(loss) from investment transactions consist of net investment gain (loss), impairment loss on other investments, net unrealized
gain (loss) on other investments, dividend and interest income and trading and margin interest expense. The other segment consists
of corporate general and administrative expenses and the income tax expense for the entire Company. 

NOTE 8   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Four of the Portsmouth directors serve as directors of Intergroup.
Three of those directors also serve as directors of Santa Fe. The three Santa Fe directors also serve as directors of InterGroup. 

John V. Winfield serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
of the Company, Portsmouth, and InterGroup. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors, the Chief Executive
Officer, Portsmouth and InterGroup may, at times, invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. The Company encourages
such investments because it places personal resources of the Chief Executive Officer, and the resources of Portsmouth and InterGroup,
at risk in connection with investment decisions made on behalf of the Company. 

Item 1   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types
regarded as common in our business, including administrative or judicial proceedings, such as employment or labor disputes, breach
of contract liability and premises liability litigation. Where appropriate, we may establish financial reserves for such proceedings.
We also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks.

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to those forward-looking statements, which
may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

 . 

  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The Company's principal sources of revenue continue to be derived
from the investment of its 68.8% owned subsidiary, Portsmouth, in the Justice Investors limited partnership ( Justice 
or the  Partnership ), rental income from its investments in multi-family real estate properties and income received
from investment of its cash and securities assets. Justice owns a 543 room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco,
California 94108, known as the  Hilton San Francisco Financial District  (the  Hotel  or the  Property )
and related facilities, including a five-level underground parking garage. The financial statements of Justice have been consolidated
with those of the Company. 

The Hotel is operated by the Partnership as a full service Hilton
brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement (the  License Agreement ) with HLT Franchise Holding LLC (Hilton).
The Partnership entered into the License Agreement on December 10, 2004. The term of the License Agreement was for an initial period
of 15 years commencing on the opening date, with an option to extend the License Agreement for another five years, subject to certain
conditions. On June 26, 2015, the Partnership and Hilton entered into an amended franchise agreement which extended the License
Agreement through 2030, modified the monthly royalty rate, extended geographic protection to the Partnership and also provided
the Partnership certain key money cash incentives to be earned through 2030. The key money cash incentives were received on July
1, 2015. 

Justice also has a management agreement with Prism Hospitality
L.P. ( Prism ) to perform management functions for the Hotel. The management agreement with Prism had an original term
of ten years and can be terminated at any time with or without cause by the Partnership. Effective January 2014, the management
agreement with Prism was amended by the Partnership to change the nature of the services provided by Prism and the compensation
payable to Prism, among other things. Effective December 1, 2013, GMP Management, Inc. ( GMP ), a company owned by
a Justice limited partner and a related party, began to provide management services for the Partnership pursuant to a management
services agreement with a term of three years, subject to the Partnership s right to terminate earlier, for cause. In June
2016, GMP resigned and the Company is currently interviewing several national third party hotel management companies to replace
GMP. 

The parking garage that is part of the Hotel property was managed
by Ace Parking pursuant to a contract with the Partnership. The contract was terminated with an effective termination date of October
4, 2016. The Company began managing the parking garage in-house after the termination of Ace Parking. 

In addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also
generates income from the ownership and management of real estate. On December 31, 1997, the Company acquired a controlling 55.4%
interest in Intergroup Woodland Village, Inc. ( Woodland Village ) from InterGroup. Woodland Village's major asset is
a 27-unit apartment complex located in Los Angeles, California. The Company also owns a two-unit apartment building in Los Angeles,
California. 

Three months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three months
Ended September 30, 2015  

The Company had net income of $1,088,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to net income of $596,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net
income is primarily attributable to the higher income from the Hotel operations. 

Net income from Hotel operations increased to $1,673,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 from net income of $1,237,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
is primarily due to the reduction of expenses as the result of the resignation of GMP management in June 2016 and the decrease
in legal expenses as the result of the legal settlement that was reached in May 2016. Please see Note 17 of the Company s
June 30, 2016 10-K report for further information. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the decrease in total
Hotel revenues. 

The following table sets forth a more detailed presentation
of Hotel operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Hotel had
operating income of $4,349,000 before disposal of assets, interest, depreciation and amortization on total operating revenues of
$14,605,000 compared to operating income of $3,945,000 before disposal of assets, interest, depreciation and amortization on total
operating revenues of $15,138,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Room revenues decreased by $309,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as the result of the
decrease in group business and the decrease in the average daily rate. Food and beverage revenue decreased by $201,000 as the result
of the reduction in the catering and banquet services from the decrease in the group business. 

Total operating expenses decreased by $937,000 this quarter
as compared to the previous comparable quarter primarily due decrease in operating expenses related to the resignation of GMP management
and the reduction in legal expenses as discussed above.        

The following table sets forth the average daily room rate,
average occupancy percentage and room revenue per available room ( RevPAR ) of the Hotel for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The Hotel s revenues decreased by
3.5% this quarter as compared to the previous comparable quarter. Average daily rate decreased by $10 and RevPAR decreased by $6
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the average
daily rate was partially offset by an increase in occupancy to 97% from 95%. 

Our highest priority is guest satisfaction. We believe that
enhancing the guest experience differentiates the Hotel from our competition and is critical to the Hotel s objective of
building sustainable guest loyalty. In order to make a large impact on guest experience, the Hotel will continue training team
members on Hilton brand standards and guest satisfaction, hiring and retaining talents in key operations and enhancing the arrival
experience. In addition, the Hotel replaced the carpet flooring in the lobby and the fourth floor with oak wood, creating an open
and welcoming environment; modernized the furniture in the lobby, the porte cochere, and the second floor; and replaced the third
floor carpets and doors. The Wellness Center on the fifth floor features a new spa with two treatment rooms and a room for manicures
and pedicures. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, the Hotel partially remodeled 14 floors of guest rooms by updating the
tables and the night stands with granite tops for a sleek and modern look. As the Hotel continues to further develop its ties with
the financial district community and the City of San Francisco, the Hotel is also committed to promoting innovative business ideas
and good corporate citizenship. 

With the high demand in guest rooms, the Hotel can focus more
attention on length and patterns of stay that benefit the Hotel. The Hotel is also focusing on high end clients with more banquet
and meeting room requirements. Moving forward, the Hotel will continue to focus on cultivating international business and capturing
a greater percentage of the higher rated business, leisure and group travel. The Hotel will continue to explore new and innovative
ways to differentiate the Hotel from its competition, as well as focusing on returning our food and beverage operations to profitability.
However, like all hotels, it will remain subject to the uncertain domestic and global economic environment and other risk factors
beyond our control, such as the effect of natural disasters and adverse business conditions. 

Rental revenue from the Company s real estate operations
decreased to $90,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $123,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015
as the result of the on-going renovations to approximately 30% of the units in the 27-unit apartment complex. Operating expenses
also decreased to $48,000 from $64,000 in the same comparable period due to the renovations. Management continues to review and
analyze the Company s real estate operations to improve occupancy and rental rates, reduce expenses and improve efficiencies. 

The Company had a gain on marketable securities of $425,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net gain on marketable securities of $178,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 64% and 95%, respectively, of the investment in marketable
securities balance above is comprised of the common stock of Comstock Mining, Inc. (Comstock). As the result, the change in the
market price of the common stock of Comstock will have a significant impact on the gain (loss) on marketable securities. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net realized gain of $120,000 and a net unrealized gain of $305,000. For
the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a net realized loss of $23,000 and a net unrealized gain of $201,000.
Gains and losses on marketable securities may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future and could have a significant
impact on the Company s results of operations. However, the amount of gain or loss on marketable securities for any given
period may have no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period may have no analytical value. For a more detailed
description of the composition of the Company s marketable securities see the Marketable Securities section below. 

The
Company and its subsidiary, Portsmouth, compute and file income tax returns and prepare discrete income tax provisions for financial
reporting.  The income tax expense during the  three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  represents
primarily the income tax effect on the Portsmouth s pretax income which includes its share in net income of the Hotel.   

MARKETABLE SECURITIES   

The following table shows the composition of the Company s
marketable securities portfolio as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 by selected industry groups. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company s investment in
marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of (64.1%) of the common stock of Comstock Mining, Inc. ( Comstock 
- NYSE MKT: LODE) which is included in the basic materials industry group. 

The following table shows the net gain or loss on the Company s
marketable securities and the associated margin interest and trading expenses for the respective periods 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  

The Company s cash flows are primarily
generated from its Hotel operations. The Company also generates cash from the investment of its cash and marketable securities,
other investments and the ownership of real estate. 

On December 18, 2013, the Partnership completed an Offer to
Redeem any and all limited partnership interests not held by Portsmouth. As a result, Portsmouth, which prior to the Offer to Redeem
owned 50% of the then outstanding limited partnership interests now controls approximately 93% of the voting interest in Justice
and is now its sole General Partner. 

To fund the redemption of limited partnership interests and
to repay the prior mortgage of $42,940,000. Justice obtained a $97,000,000 mortgage loan and a $20,000,000 mezzanine loan. The
mortgage loan is secured by the Partnership s principal asset, the Hotel. The mortgage loan bears an interest rate of 5.275%
per annum with interest only payments due thru January 2017. Beginning in February 2017, the loan will begin to amortize over a
thirty year period thru its maturity date of January 2024. As additional security for the mortgage loan, there is a limited guaranty
executed by the Company in favor of mortgage lender. The mezzanine loan is a secured by the Operating membership interest held
by Mezzanine and is subordinated to the Mortgage Loan. The mezzanine interest only loan bears interest at 9.75% per annum and matures
in January 2024. As additional security for the mezzanine loan, there is a limited guaranty executed by the Company in favor of
mezzanine lender. 

On July 2, 2014, the Partnership obtained from InterGroup an
unsecured loan in the principal amount of $4,250,000 at 12% per year fixed interest, with a term of 2 years, payable interest only
each month. InterGroup received a 3% loan fee. The loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The proceeds of the loan were
applied to the July 2014 payments to Holdings as described in Note 2 of the Company s June 30, 2016 10-K Report. The loan
was extended to November 30, 2016. InterGroup is currently working on amending the loan agreement to extend the loan for a longer
period. 

Despite an uncertain economy, the Hotel has continued to generate
positive operating income growth. While the debt service requirements related the loans may create some additional risk for the
Company and its ability to generate cash flows in the future, management believes that cash flows from the operations of the Hotel
and the garage will continue to be sufficient to meet all of the Partnership s current and future obligations and financial
requirements. 

The Company has invested in short-term, income-producing instruments
and in equity and debt securities when deemed appropriate. The Company's marketable securities are classified as trading with unrealized
gains and losses recorded through the consolidated statements of operations. 

Management believes that its cash, marketable securities, other
investments, real estate operations and the cash flows generated from those assets and from the partnership management fees, will
be adequate to meet the Company s current and future obligations. 

MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  

The following table provides a summary as of September 30, 2016,
the Company s material financial obligations which also including interest payments: 

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements. 

IMPACT OF INFLATION  

Hotel room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand
factors, not inflation, since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited number of nights. Room rates can be, and usually
are, adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases. Since the Company has the power and ability to adjust hotel room rates
on an ongoing basis,  there should be minimal impact on partnership revenues due to inflation.
Partnership revenues are also subject to interest rate risks, which may be influenced by inflation. For the two most recent fiscal
years, the impact of inflation on the Company's income is not viewed by management as material.  

The Company's residential rental properties provide income from
short-term operating leases and no lease extends beyond one year. Rental increases are expected to offset anticipated increased
property operating expenses. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE
OF ESTIMATES  

Critical accounting policies are those that are most significant
to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and require judgments by management in order to make estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates
on an on-going basis, including those related to the consolidation of our subsidiaries, to our revenues, allowances for bad debts,
accruals, asset impairments, other investments, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates
or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to the Company s
critical accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Please refer to the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 for a summary of the critical accounting policies.
