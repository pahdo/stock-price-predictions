   NOTES

1.        ORGANIZATION
AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Nature
of Operations and Activities   

  Solitron
Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company  or  Solitron ), designs, develops, manufactures,
and markets solid-state semiconductor components and related devices primarily for the military and aerospace markets. The Company
was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1959 and reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in
August 1987.  

Basis
of Presentation   

  The
unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  

The
unaudited condensed financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items that,
in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the interim periods. The results of operations for the six months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending February 28, 2017.  

The
information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended February 29, 2016.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

  Cash
and cash equivalents include demand deposits and money market accounts.  

Investment
in Treasury Bills and Certificates of Deposit   

  Investment
in treasury bills and certificates of deposit include treasury bills with maturities of one year or less, and is stated at market
value.  

All
of the Company s investments are classified as available-for-sale. As they are available for current operations,
they are classified as current on the balance sheets.  Investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at
fair value with unrecognized gains or losses, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is included
as a separate component of stockholders  equity. The Company monitors its investments for impairment periodically and records
appropriate reductions in carrying values when the declines are determined to be other-than-temporary.  

As
of August 31, 2016, the Company s available for sale non-equity investments were comprised of certificates of deposits.  

As
of August 31, 2016, contractual maturities of the Company's available-for-sale non-equity investments were as follows:  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

  Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines  fair
value  as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date.  ASC 820 also sets forth a valuation hierarchy of the inputs (assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability) used to measure fair value.  This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into the following
three levels:  

Level 1:  
      Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices
for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets.   

Level 2:  
      Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level
1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.   

Level 3:  
      Inputs that are generally unobservable.  These
inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that results in management s best estimate of fair value.   

The
Company s brokered Treasury bills and certificates of deposits are subject to Level 1 fair value measurement.  

The carrying amounts of the Company s
short-term financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate
their fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments. 

Accounts
Receivable   

  Accounts
receivable consists of unsecured credit extended to the Company s customers in the ordinary course of business. The Company
reserves for any amounts deemed to be uncollectible based on past collection experiences and an analysis of outstanding balances,
using an allowance account. The allowance amount was $2,000 as of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016.  

Shipping
and Handling   

  Shipping
and handling costs billed to customers are recorded in net sales. Shipping costs incurred by the Company are recorded in cost
of sales.  

Inventories   

  Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the  first-in, first-out  (FIFO) method. The Company
buys raw material to fill customer orders. Excess raw material typically results from a vendor imposed minimum buy in excess of
actual requirements. Such excess material can be used to meet the requirements of the customer s subsequent orders. If excess
material is not utilized after two fiscal years, it is fully reserved, excluding wafer related inventories in raw, work in process,
and diced form which are fully reserved after three fiscal years. Any inventory item once designated as reserved is carried at
zero value in all subsequent valuation activities.  

  The
Company s inventory valuation policy is as follows:  

Raw material /Work in process:    
      All material purchased, processed, and/or used in the
last two fiscal years is valued at the lower of its acquisition cost or market, except for wafers which function under a three
year policy. All material not used in the last two fiscal years is fully reserved.   

Finished goods:  
      All finished goods with firm orders for later delivery
are valued (material and overhead) at the lower of cost or market. All finished goods with no orders are fully reserved.   

Direct labor costs:  
      Direct labor costs are allocated to finished goods and
work in process inventory based on engineering estimates of the amount of man-hours required from the different direct labor departments
to bring each device to its particular level of completion. Manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to finished goods and work
in process inventory as a ratio to direct labor costs.   

Revenue
Recognition   

  Revenue
is recognized in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue Recognition .  This
pronouncement requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized: 1) there is evidence that an arrangement
exists; 2) delivery has occurred; 3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
We recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met.  The criteria are usually
met at the time of product shipment. Shipping terms are generally FCA (Free Carrier) shipping point.  

Financial
Statement Estimates   

  The
preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and the differences could be material. Such estimates
include depreciable life, valuation allowance, and allowance for inventory obsolescence.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

  No
recent accounting pronouncements affecting the Company were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standards-setting
bodies.  

2.        ENVIRONMENTAL
REGULATION    

While
the Company believes that it has the environmental permits necessary to conduct its business and that its operations conform to
present environmental regulations, increased public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing
operations. The Company, in the conduct of its manufacturing operations, has handled and does handle materials that are considered
hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state and local laws and, therefore, is subject to regulations related to their use,
storage, discharge and disposal. No assurance can be made that the risk of accidental release of such materials can be completely
eliminated. In the event of a violation of environmental laws, the Company could be held liable for damages and the costs of remediation.
In addition, the Company, along with the rest of the semiconductor industry, is subject to variable interpretations and governmental
priorities concerning environmental laws and regulations.  

Environmental
statutes have been interpreted to provide for joint and several liability and strict liability regardless of actual fault. There
can be no assurance that the Company and its subsidiaries will not be required to incur costs to comply with, or that the operations,
business or financial condition of the Company will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws
or regulations.  

3.
        EARNINGS PER SHARE   

The
shares used in the computation of the Company s basic and diluted earnings per common share were as follows:  

Weighted average common shares outstanding,
assuming dilution, include the incremental shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of stock options. 

For the three months and six months
ended August 31, 2015, 290,073 shares underlying outstanding stock awards were not included in the computation of loss per common
share   diluted because their effect would have been antidilutive. For the three months and six months ended August 31, 2016,
there were no outstanding stock options. 

4.        INVENTORIES   

As
of August 31, 2016, inventories consist of the following:  

As
of February 29, 2016, inventories consist of the following: 

5.        INCOME
TAXES   

At
August 31, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10,016,000 that expire through February 2028.
Such net operating losses are available to offset future taxable income, if any. As the utilization of such net operating losses
for tax purposes is not assured, the deferred tax asset has been fully reserved through the recording of a 100% valuation allowance.
Should a cumulative change in the ownership of more than 50% occur within a three-year period, there could be an annual limitation
on the use of the net operating loss carryforwards.  

Net
operating losses are subject to a twenty-year loss carryforward.  Of the Company s $10,016,000 of net operating loss
carryforwards as of August 31, 2016, approximately $1,254,000 expire in 2021, $1,248,000 expire in 2022, and $7,514,000 expire
in 2028.

ITEM 2.  
       Management s Discussion
and Analysis of FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS of operations     

Overview:   

Solitron
Devices, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company  or  Solitron ), designs, develops, manufactures and
markets solid-state semiconductor components and related devices primarily for the military and aerospace markets. The Company
manufactures a large variety of bipolar and metal oxide semiconductor ( MOS ) power transistors, power and control
hybrids, junction and power MOS field effect transistors and other related products. Most of the Company s products are
custom made pursuant to contracts with customers whose end products are sold to the United States government. Other products,
such as Joint Army/Navy transistors, diodes and Standard Military Drawings voltage regulators, are sold as standard or catalog
items.  

The
following discussion and analysis of factors which have affected the Company's financial position and operating results during
the periods included in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Financial
Statements and the related Notes to Financial Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016 and
the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements and the related Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements included in Item
1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Significant
Accounting Policies:   

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the unaudited condensed
financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which are prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and
assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies include
cash and cash equivalents, investment in Treasury bills and Certificates of Deposit, accounts receivable, revenue
recognition, earnings per common share, shipping and handling, and inventories. A discussion of these critical accounting
policies are included in Note 1 of the  Notes To Financial Statements  in Item 8 of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016.  

Trends
and Uncertainties :  

During the three months ended August 31,
2016, the Company s book-to-bill ratio was approximately .97 as compared to approximately .18 for the three months ended
August 31, 2015, reflecting an increase in the volume of orders booked. The Company does not believe that, in most years, the
year-to-year change in the book-to-bill ratio indicates a specific trend in the demand for the Company s products. Generally,
the intake of orders over the last twenty four months has varied greatly as a result of the fluctuations in the general economy,
variations in defense spending on programs the Company supports, and the timing of contract awards by the Department of Defense
and subsequently by its prime contractors, which is expected to continue over the next twelve to twenty four months .
 Subsequent to the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company has been advised by one of its key customers that it
has been in the process of seeking out additional or alternative sources for some of the Company s products, which has resulted
in order delay and a decline in the Company s backlog. The Company is addressing the concerns of the customer, but it is
uncertain if the Company will be successful in addressing the customer s concerns.  

Results
of Operations-Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended August 31, 2015 :  

Net
sales for the three months ended August 31, 2016 decreased 15% to $1,875,000 as compared to $2,212,000 for the three months ended
August 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the level of orders of products that were shipped in
accordance with customer requirements.  

Cost
of sales for the three months ended August 31, 2016 increased 5% to 1,721,000 as compared to $1,646,000 for the three months ended
August 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in inventory reserves of $145,000. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, cost
of sales increased to 92% as compared to 74% for the same period in 2015.  

Gross
profit for the three months ended August 31, 2016 decreased to $154,000 from $566,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2015,
mostly due to the lower level of sales. Accordingly, gross margins on the Company s sales decreased to 8% for the three
months ended August 31, 2016 from 26% for the three months ending August 31, 2015.  

For
the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company shipped 16,113 units as compared to 20,623 units shipped during the same period
of the prior year. It should be noted that since the Company manufactures a wide variety of products with an average sales price
ranging from less than one dollar to several hundred dollars, such periodic variations in the Company s volume of units
shipped should not be regarded as a reliable indicator of the Company s performance.  

For the three months ended August 31, 2016,
the Company s backlog of open orders decreased 2% to $4,485,000 as compared to the backlog of $4,588,000 as of August 31,
2015. Changes in backlog reflect changes in the intake of orders and in the delivery requirements of customers.  

For
the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company s level of bookings were $1,828,000, an increase of $1,420,000, or 348%,
as compared to the level of bookings of $408,000 in the three months ended August 31, 2015. The increase in bookings for the three
months ended August 31, 2016 is principally a result of an increase in the placement of orders by key customers.  

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses increased 122% to $1,674,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 from $755,000 for
the three months ended August 31, 2015. Both quarters experienced higher than normal costs. In the August 31, 2015 quarter the
Company experienced increased costs due to the proxy contest in connection with its 2015 annual stockholders  meeting. The
increase in the August 31, 2016 quarter was primarily due to costs associated with the separation agreement the Company entered
into with its former CEO and certain proxy reimbursement expenses as reported in the Company s 8-K filing on July 27, 2016.
Costs related to the separation agreement included $627,000 of payments associated with the retirement of the former Chief Executive
Officer (see Note 12 above), $22,000 of associated payroll taxes, $100,000 of legal fees, and $170,000 of proxy settlement costs.
The increase also reflects higher wages due to the use of temporary staffing in the finance department, consulting fees, and $48,000
of director bonuses ($12,000 per director). During the three months ended August 31, 2016, selling, general, and administrative
expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 89% as compared with 34% for the three months ended August 31, 2015.   

Operating
(loss) for the three months ended August 31, 2016 was ($1,520,000) as compared to operating income (loss) of ($189,000) for the
three months ended August 31, 2015. The increased loss is due primarily to lower sales and higher selling, general and administrative
expenses.  

Interest
income for the three months ended August 31, 2016 increased to $10,000 as compared to $4,000 for the three months ended August
31, 2015. This change is due primarily to the rate of return on funds invested in certificates of deposit and treasury bills.  

The
Company had no other income for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015.  

Total
 comprehensive (loss) for the three months ended August 31, 2016 was ($1,501,000) as compared to
a total comprehensive (loss) of ($178,000) for  the three months ended August 31, 2015. The increased loss is due primarily
to a decrease in net sales and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses  

Results
of Operations-Six Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended August 31, 2015 :  

Net
sales for the six months ended August 31, 2016 decreased 20% to $3,688,000 as compared to $4,595,000 for the six months ended
August 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the level of orders of products that were shipped in
accordance with customer requirements.  

Cost
of sales for the six months ended August 31, 2016 decreased 10% to $3,176,000 as compared to $3,527,000 for the three months ended
August 31, 2015, mostly due to the lower level of sales. Expressed as a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 86% as
compared to 77% for the same period in 2015.  

Gross
profit for the six months ended August 31, 2016 decreased to $512,000 from $1,068,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015,
mostly due to the lower level of sales. Accordingly, gross margins on the Company s sales decreased to 14% for the six months
ended August 31, 2016 from 23% for the six months ending August 31, 2015.  

For
the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company shipped 36,942 units as compared to 40,427 units shipped during the same period
of the prior year. It should be noted that since the Company manufactures a wide variety of products with an average sales price
ranging from less than one dollar to several hundred dollars, such periodic variations in the Company s volume of units
shipped should not be regarded as a reliable indicator of the Company s performance.  

For
the six months ended August 31, 2016, the Company s backlog of open orders decreased 23% to $4,485,000 as compared to the
backlog of $5,832,000 as of February 29, 2016. The Company s backlog as of August 31, 2016 is 2% lower than the backlog
of $4,588,000 as of August 31, 2015. Changes in backlog reflect changes in the intake of orders and in the delivery requirements
of customers.  

The
Company experienced an increase of $345,000, or 17% to $2,341,000 in the level of bookings during the six months ended August
31, 2016 as compared to the six months ended August 31, 2015. The increase in bookings for the six months ended August 31, 2016
is principally a result of an increase in the placement of orders by key customers.  

Selling,
general, and administrative expenses increased 79% to $2,185,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 from $1,222,000 for
the six months ended August 31, 2015. The increase in costs was primarily due to costs associated with the separation agreement
the Company entered into with its former CEO and certain proxy reimbursement expenses as reported in the Company s 8-K filing
on July 27, 2016. Costs related to the separation agreement included $627,000 of payments associated with the retirement of the
former Chief Executive Officer (see Note 12 above), $22,000 of associated payroll taxes, $100,000 of legal fees, and $170,000
of proxy settlement costs. The increase also reflects higher wages due to the use of temporary staffing in the finance department,
consulting fees, and $48,000 of director bonuses ($12,000 per director). During the six months ended August 31, 2016, selling,
general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 59% as compared with 27% for the six months ended
August 31, 2015.

August 31, 2016 was ($1,673,000) as compared to operating (loss) of ($154,000) for the six months ended August 31, 2015. The increased
loss is due primarily to lower sales and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.  

Interest
income for the six months ended August 31, 2016 increased to $20,000 as compared to $12,000 for the six months ended August 31,
2015. This change is due primarily to the rate of return on funds invested in certificates of deposit and treasury bills.  

The
Company had no other income for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and ended August 31, 2015.  

Total

for the six months ended August 31, 2015. The increased loss is due primarily to lower sales and higher selling, general and administrative
expenses.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources:   

Operating
Activities:   

Net
cash used in operating activities was $1,439,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 primarily reflecting a net loss of $1,653,000,
an increase in accounts receivable of $323,000, and an increase in inventory of $105,000, offset by depreciation of $97,000, and
higher accounts payable of $587,000.  

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $41,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015 primarily reflecting a net loss of
$142,000 and a decrease in accounts payable of $166,000 offset by depreciation and amortization of $105,000 and a decrease in
inventory of $297,000.  

Investing
Activities:   

Net
cash provided by investing activities was $3,829,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 principally reflecting $4,000,000
in sales of treasury bills and certificates of deposit, and $171,000 in purchases of property, plant and equipment.  

Net
cash provided by investing activities was $142,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015 principally reflecting $3,154,000
in sales of treasury bills and certificates of deposit, $2,893,000 in purchases of treasury bills and certificates of deposit,
and $119,000 in purchases of property, plant and equipment.  

Financing
Activities:   

Net
cash used in financing activities was $2,137,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 reflecting payments associated with
the retirement of the former Chief Executive Officer (see Note 12).  

Net
cash used in financing activities was $557,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2015 primarily reflecting a $575,000 dividend
paid to stockholders partially offset by a net $18,000 of cash received by the Company in connection with the exercise of stock
options by an Executive of the Company and other Company employees. The net $18,000 consisted of $148,000 paid by an Executive
of the Company and $1,000 paid by other employees in connection with the exercise of stock options offset by the Company s
payment of $130,000 of federal income taxes due in exchange for withholding of 29,315 shares of the Company s common stock
that the Executive of the Company would have otherwise received in connection with his option exercise.  

Subject
to the following discussion, the Company expects its liquidity over the next twelve months to come from cash generated from operations,
cash on hand and cash invested in Treasury bills and certificates of deposit. The Company anticipates that its capital expenditures
required to sustain operations will be approximately $150,000 during the balance of the current fiscal year and will be funded
from operations and/or available cash.  

Based
upon (i) management s best information as to current national defense priorities, future defense programs, as well as management s
expectations as to future defense spending, (ii) the market trends signaling a declining level of bookings, but with an increase
in the cost of raw materials and operations that will result in the potential erosion of profit levels and continued price pressures
due to more intense competition, and (iii) the continued competition in the defense and aerospace market, the Company believes
that it will have sufficient cash on hand and cash from operations to satisfy its operating needs over the next twelve months.
However, due to the level of current backlog, projected new order intake, the status of the general economy and the shift to Commercial
Off-The-Shelf (COTS) by the defense industry, the Company might be required to take cost cutting and productivity enhancing activity
to assure its continued profitability.  

Over
the long-term, based on these factors and at the current level of bookings, costs of raw materials and services, profit margins
and sales levels, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient cash from operations to satisfy its operating needs over
the next twelve months. In the event that bookings in the long-term decline significantly below the level experienced during the
previous two fiscal years, the Company may be required to implement further cost-cutting or other downsizing measures to continue
its business operations. Such cost-cutting measures could inhibit future growth prospects. In appropriate situations, the Company
may seek strategic alliances, joint ventures with others or acquisitions in order to maximize marketing potential and utilization
of existing resources and provide further opportunities for growth.  

At
August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, the Company had cash on hand of approximately $888,000 and $634,000, respectively. The
cash increase for the six months ended August 31, 2016 was primarily due to the sale of treasury bills and certificates of deposit.  

At
August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, the Company had investments in treasury bills and certificates of deposit of approximately
$2,739,000 and $6,740,000, respectively.  

At
August 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of $7,204,000 as compared with a working capital at February 29, 2016 of $11,068,000.
The working capital decrease for the six months ended August 31, 2016 was primarily due to cash used in operations and financing
activities.  

Based
on various factors, including the Company s desire to fully utilize its current net operating loss carryforwards, the Company
may seek out acquisitions, additional product lines, and/or invest a portion of its cash into common stocks or higher yielding
debt instruments.  The Company will continue to consider additional share repurchases under the Company's stock repurchase
program.  

Cash
Dividend:   

The
Board of Directors of the Company did not declare a cash dividend during the three and six months ended August 31, 2016. In July
2015, the Company paid a dividend of $0.25 per share to all stockholders of record at the close of business on June 29, 2015.
The aggregate dividend payment was approximately $575,000.  

Stock
Repurchase Program:   

On
May 29, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company
may repurchase up to $500,000 of its outstanding common stock from time to time through February 29, 2016. On July 28, 2015, the
Company announced that the Board of Directors had expanded the stock repurchase program to cover repurchases of up to $1,000,000
of its outstanding common stock from time to time through February 29, 2016. On November 20, 2015, the Company purchased for $279,616
a total of 65,027 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the repurchase program. On January 15, 2016, the Board
of Directors of the Company amended the repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $1,000,000 of its outstanding
common stock without an expiration date to the repurchase program. Under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made by the
Company from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending on markets conditions, stock price,
corporate and regulatory requirements, and other factors.  

The
Company did not repurchase any shares under the stock repurchase program during the six months ended August 31, 2016. See Note
12 for shares and options repurchased from the former Chief Executive Officer.  

Retirement
of Former Chief Executive Officer:

The
Company has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Forward
Looking Statements:   

Some
of the statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are  forward-looking statements,  as that term is defined in
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our business,
financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact
that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated
or expected events, activities, trends or results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred,
these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results
to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described
under the caption  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016, including those
identified below. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law.  

Some
of the factors that may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects include:  

Loss
                                         of, or reduction of business from, substantial clients could hurt our business by reducing
                                         our revenues, profitability and cash flow.   
 
         Our
                                         complex manufacturing processes may lower yields and reduce our revenues.   
 
         Our
                                         business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain qualified
                                         supplies of raw materials, parts and finished components on a timely basis and at a cost-effective
                                         price.   
 
         We
                                         are dependent on government contracts, which are subject to termination, price renegotiations
                                         and regulatory compliance, which can increase the cost of doing business and negatively
                                         impact our revenues.   
 
         Changes
                                         in government policy or economic conditions could negatively impact our results.   
 
         Our
                                         inventories may become obsolete and other assets may be subject to risks.   
 
         Environmental
                                         regulations could require us to incur significant costs.   
 
         Our
                                         business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce gross profit margins
                                         and the value of an investment in our Company.   
 
         Downturns
                                         in the business cycle could reduce the revenues and profitability of our business.   
 
         Our
                                         operating results may decrease due to the decline of profitability in the semiconductor
                                         industry.   
 
         Uncertainty
                                         of current economic conditions, domestically and globally, could continue to affect demand
                                         for our products and negatively impact our business.   
 
         Cost
                                         reduction efforts may be unsuccessful or insufficient to improve our profitability and
                                         may adversely impact productivity.   
 
         We
                                         may not achieve the intended effects of our business strategy, which could adversely
                                         impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.   
 
         Our
                                         inability to introduce new products could result in decreased revenues and loss of market
                                         share to competitors; new technologies could also reduce the demand for our products.   
 
         A
                                         shortage of three-inch silicon wafers could result in lost revenues due to an inability
                                         to build our products.   
 
         The
                                         nature of our products exposes us to potentially significant product liability risk.   
 
         We
                                         depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract
                                         and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business.   
 
         Provisions
                                         in our charter documents and rights agreement could make it more difficult to acquire
                                         our Company and may reduce the market price of our stock.   
 
         Natural
                                         disasters, like hurricanes, or occurrences of other natural disasters whether in the
                                         United States or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades,
                                         the markets in which we operate and our profitability.   
 
         Failure
                                         to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to use certain technologies
                                         may negatively affect our ability to compete.   
 
         We
                                         cannot promise that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments
                                         in manufacturing technology and equipment.   
 
         We
                                         may make substantial investments in plant and equipment that may become impaired.   
 
         While
                                         we attempt to monitor the credit worthiness of our customers, we may be at risk due to
                                         the adverse financial condition of one or more customers.   

Our
                                         international operations expose us to material risks, including risks under U.S. export
                                         laws.   

Security
                                         breaches and other disruptions could compromise the integrity of our information and
                                         expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.   
 
         The
                                         price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may fluctuate widely
                                         in the future.   
 
         We
                                         cannot guarantee that we will declare future cash dividend payments at historic rates
                                         or at all, nor repurchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase
                                         program.   
 
         Compliance
                                         with regulations regarding the use of  conflict minerals  could limit the supply
                                         and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.   
 
         Our
                                         failure to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
                                         or our identification of any other material weaknesses in the future may adversely affect
                                         the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting.    

ITEM 4.  
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Our
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e), and 15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of August
31, 2016 due to the material weakness described in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February
29, 2016 under  Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . However, giving full consideration
to the material weakness and the remediation plan, the Company s management has concluded that the Company s financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition
and results of operations as of and for the three months ended August 31, 2016.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.   

Other
than the changes referenced in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016 under  Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting , there were no changes in the Company s internal control over
financial reporting during the second quarter ended August 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

II  OTHER INFORMATION
