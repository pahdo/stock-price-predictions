CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS   

This Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future
events that are intended as  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995.  All statements included or incorporated by reference in this report, other than statements of historical fact,
that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking
statements. These statements appear in a number of places, including, but not limited to  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  These statements represent our reasonable judgment of
the future based on various factors and using numerous assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that could cause our actual results and financial position to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. You
can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, and use words such as
 anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect,   forecast,   may, 
 should,   plan,   project  and other words of similar meaning. In particular, these include,
but are not limited to, statements relating to the following:   

projected operating or financial results, including anticipated cash flows used in operations;     

expectations regarding capital expenditures, research and development expense and other payments;     

our beliefs and assumptions relating to our liquidity position, including our ability to obtain additional financing;     

our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our pharmaceutical drugs and diagnostics; and     

our future dependence on third party manufacturers or strategic partners to manufacture any of our pharmaceutical drugs and diagnostics that receive regulatory approval, and our ability to identify strategic partners and enter into license, co-development, collaboration or similar arrangements.     

Any or all of our
forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors including, among others:   

the loss of key management personnel or sponsored research partners on whom we depend;     

the progress and results of clinical trials for our product candidates;     

our ability to navigate the regulatory approval process in the U.S. and other countries, and our success in obtaining required regulatory approvals for our product candidates;     

commercial developments for products that compete with our product candidates;     

the actual and perceived effectiveness of our product candidates, and how those product candidates compare to competitive products;     

the strength of our intellectual property protection, and our success in avoiding infringing the intellectual property rights of others;     

adverse developments in our research and development activities;     

potential liability if our product candidates cause illness, injury or death, or adverse publicity from any such events;     

our ability to operate our business efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs (including general and administrative expenses) and obtain financing when required;     

our expectations with respect to our acquisition activity.     

In addition, there
may be other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the results referenced in the forward-looking
statements, some of which are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Many of these factors will be important in determining
our actual future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Our actual future results may
vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements contained in
this Quarterly Report of Form 10-Q are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date they are made, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events
or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except as otherwise required by applicable law.

Note 1 Nature of Operations   

These financial statements represent the
consolidated financial statements of AntriaBio, Inc. ( AntriaBio ), and its
wholly owned operating subsidiary, AntriaBio Delaware, Inc. ( Antria Delaware ). AntriaBio and Antria Delaware are
collectively referred to herein as the  Company . 

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the
rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information and with the instructions
to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. 

The unaudited interim financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on September 28, 2016, which contains the
audited financial statements and notes thereto, together with the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

Certain information or footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for
interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation
of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. It is management's opinion, however, that all material adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation. The
interim results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions impact, among others,
the following: estimated useful lives and impairment of depreciable assets, the fair value of share-based payments and warrants,
fair value of derivative instruments, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent liabilities and the valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing and expected future operating losses. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Risks and Uncertainties  

The Company's operations may be subject
to significant risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks associated with a preclinical
stage company, including the potential risk of business failure. See Note 3 regarding going concern matters. 

6  

Fixed Assets  

Fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. 

Research and Development Costs  

Research and development costs are expensed
as incurred and include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; consultants and outside costs; material manufacturing
costs; and facilities and other costs. These costs relate to research and development costs without an allocation of general and
administrative expenses. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the exchange price
that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standard also expands
disclosures about instruments measured at fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three
levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;   

Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant
inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and   

Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
significant value drivers are unobservable.   

The carrying amounts of financial instruments
including cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and convertible notes payable approximated fair value as of September 30,
2016 and June 30, 2016 due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments. 

The warrant derivative liability recorded
as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 is recorded at an estimated fair value based on a Black-Scholes pricing model. The warrant
derivative liability is a level 3 fair value measurement with the entire change in the balance recorded through earnings. See significant
assumptions in Note 9. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of financial instruments classified
as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
 Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ), which provides
guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires
management to perform assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial
statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's
ability to continue as a going concern. We will be required to perform the going concern assessment under ASU 2014-15 beginning
with the year ending June 30, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of the new provisions to have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations. 

7  

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,
 Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) , which eliminates the concept of extraordinary
items. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015.
The new guidance is to be applied prospectively but may also be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial
statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
We adopted the provisions of this new guidance on July 1, 2016. The new provisions did not have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
 Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which is intended to improve how deferred taxes are classified
on organizations  balance sheets by eliminating the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities
and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will now be required to classify all
deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The changes are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We adopted the provisions of this new guidance
on July 1, 2016. The adoption of the new provisions did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
 Financial Instruments   Overall :  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ,
which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01
will be effective for us starting on July 1, 2018, and early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact
that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) . This update requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet
and also disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or
after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as
of the beginning of an interim or annual period. We will be required to adopt ASU 2016-02 starting on July 1, 2019. We are currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09.
 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The update
will affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees and is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016 for public entities. The areas for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows. We will be required to adopt this ASU starting on July 1, 2017. We are currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3 Going Concern    

As reflected in the accompanying financial
statements, the Company has a net loss of $3,815,867 and net cash used in operations of $2,968,310 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, and working capital equity of $2,242,925 and stockholders  equity of $8,202,202 and an accumulated deficit of $47,860,697
at September 30, 2016.  In addition, the Company is in the preclinical stage and has not yet generated any revenues.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company expects that its current
cash resources as well as expected lack of operating cash flows will not be sufficient to sustain operations for a period
greater than one year. The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on Management's plans, which
include continuing to raise capital through equity based financings. There can be no assurances that such capital will be
available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 

8  

The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets
or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Note 4 Fixed Assets   

The following is a summary of fixed assets
and accumulated depreciation: 

Depreciation expense was $268,355 and $70,313
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Note 5 Related Party Transactions

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company incurred investor relations expenses of $36,225 for services performed by a related party of the Company
and included in the statement of operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, there were no related party transactions. 

Note 6 Convertible Notes Payable   

From 2010 to 2014, the Company issued several
series of convertible promissory notes for which principal and interest were due between six months and two years after issuance.
The convertible notes allowed investors to convert their shares into common stock at the time of certain qualifying events with
some of the notes also issuing warrants at the time of conversion.  

On March 31, 2014, the Company closed on
an equity transaction which qualified as a  qualified financing  as such the $2,703,000 in 2013 Notes and the accrued
interest was converted into 2,186,838 shares of our common stock. The Company also converted $4,275,172 of the 2010, 2011 and 2012
Notes and accrued interest into 3,111,126 shares of our common stock. The remaining balance of any debt discounts on the notes
converted was recorded into interest expense at the time of the conversion. 

As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
the convertible notes outstanding balance was $60,000 and $60,000, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, all of the outstanding
convertible notes have matured and payments were due. The convertible notes which have not been repaid or converted continue to
accrue interest at a rate of 8%. 

On October 7, 2016, one convertible note
with a balance of $50,000 and accrued interest converted into 58,350 shares of common stock. 

9  

Note 7 Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock   

On December 7, 2015, the Board of Directors
authorized fifteen million shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series A Stock ). The Series A Stock had
a conversion feature at the option of the holder that could be converted at any time at a conversion rate of $1.95, subject to
adjustment, into common stock. The shares also had a mandatory conversion feature at the same conversion rate if one of the following
events occurs: 1) Upon vote or consent of 2/3 of the then outstanding Series A Stock; 2) Upon the Company s listing to NASDAQ
Stockmarket or the NYSE MKT and the Company s common stock trades for 30 days for at least 155% of the Series A Stock conversion
price; or 3) the Company closes an underwritten public offering of at least $15 million in gross proceeds with an offering price
of at least 155% of the Series A Stock conversion price. The Series A Stock s conversion price was subject to weighted average
anti-dilution protection, as defined, and was subject to adjustments for stock splits, dividends, and similar events. The Series
A Stock was mandatorily redeemable ten years after the issuance date or upon a liquidation event, as defined, which included a
change in control and therefore recorded before stockholders  equity on the consolidated balance sheet. The Series A Stock
was entitled to an annual dividend of 6% based on the original issuance price, compounded quarterly. The dividend was cumulative
and was to be paid in shares of Series A Stock. The accrued dividends were payable upon redemption or conversion. The Series A
Stock had voting rights equal to common stockholders as if the Series A Stock converted into common stock on the record date of
the vote. The Series A Stock also had liquidation preferences over other stockholders. 

On December 10, 2015, the Company closed
an initial offering of its Series A Stock with an offering price of $1.95 per share. The Company issued 1,025,699 shares and received
net proceeds of $1,803,548 after the placement agent compensation and issuance costs paid of $105,715 and a warrant with a fair
value of $90,852 recorded as issuance costs. On March 2, 2016, the Company closed a second offering of its Series A Stock with
an offering price of $1.95 per share. The Company issued 1,716,487 shares and received net proceeds of $2,956,975 after the placement
agent compensation and issuance costs paid of $231,214 and a warrant with a fair value of $159,311 recorded as issuance costs.
On April 12, 2016, the Company closed a final offering of its Series A Stock with an offering price of $1.95 per share. The Company
issued 512,820 shares and received net proceeds of $1,000,000 as there were no placement agent compensation or issuance costs.
The issuance costs were being accreted over the ten-year life of the Series A Stock of which $22,846 was accreted during the year
ended June 30, 2016. 

Through June 24, 2016, the Company declared
and issued 71,708 shares of Series A Stock as dividends on the current outstanding shares of Series A Stock. 

On June 24, 2016, the Company and the stockholders
of the Series A Preferred Stock consented to convert all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock into common stock. The conversion
occurred at a conversion price of $1.95 per share. The Company then entered into an Exchange Agreement with each former Series
A stockholder to exchange the Conversion Shares into shares of common stock and related warrants equal to the Series A Preferred
Stock purchase price plus accrued dividends at an exchange rate of $1.10 per Exchange Share and related Exchange Warrant. The Company
converted and cancelled 3,326,714 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and issued 5,897,677 Exchange Shares and Exchange Warrants.
As the Series A stockholders received additional securities over what would have been received in the original conversion terms
the transaction was considered an induced conversion. The Exchange Shares and Exchange Warrants received are recorded at the fair
value on the date they were received. The excess of the fair value of the securities received over the fair value of the securities
the stockholders would have received under the original terms on the date of conversion was $5,811,700 and was recorded as a deemed
dividend as additional paid in capital at the time of conversion. The Company then recorded a gain on the exchange of $2,929,084,
which was also recorded into additional paid in capital. As a result of the conversion and exchange of the Series A Preferred Stock,
the Series A Preferred Stock is no longer deemed outstanding, and all rights with respect to such stock ceased and terminated.

Note 8 Shareholders  Equity   

During 2016, the Company entered into a
private placement transaction in which the Company issued 4,875,020 units to accredited investors. Each investor was issued either
Class A Units or Class B units of the Company. Each Class A Unit received one share of common stock and one-half of one common
share purchase warrant. If the investor had previously invested in the Company they were eligible for a Class B Unit which received
one share of common stock and one common share purchase warrant. Each common share purchase warrant is exercisable at $1.65 per
share and will expire 60 months following the issuance. As of June 30, 2016, the Company received net proceeds of $4.8 million
after the placement agent compensation and issuance costs paid of $553,428 and $500,321 of warrant expense recorded as issuance
costs. 

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company closed two additional private placement transactions in which the Company issued 2,447,636 units to accredited
investors. Each investor was issued either Class A Units or Class B units of the Company. Each Class A Unit received one share
of common stock and one-half of one common share purchase warrant. If the investor had previously invested in the Company they
were eligible for a Class B Unit which received one share of common stock and one common share purchase warrant. Each common share
purchase warrant is exercisable at $1.65 per share and will expire 60 months following the issuance. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company received net proceeds of $2.4 million after the placement agent compensation and issuance costs paid of $336,212 and
$225,510 of warrant expense recorded as issuance costs. 

On October 6, 2016, October 7, 2016 and
October 13, 2016 we completed additional and final closes on the private placement transaction in which the Company issued 3,335,546
units and received gross proceeds of $3.7 million. 

The Company has not declared or paid any
dividends or returned any capital to common stockholders as of September 30, 2016. 

Note 9 Stock-Based
Compensation   

Options -  AntriaBio adopted individual
stock option plans in January 2013 for four officers and/or directors of the Company. The stock option plans granted 1,500,000
option shares with an exercise price of $4.50 per share and had fully vested as of June 30, 2016. In June 2013, AntriaBio adopted
individual stock option plans for two consultants of the Company. The stock option plans granted 8,334 shares with an exercise
price of $4.50 per share and had fully vested as of June 30, 2015. 

On March 26, 2014, the Company
adopted the AntriaBio, Inc. 2014 Stock and Incentive Plan which allows the Company to issue up to 3,750,000 of common stock
in the form of stock options, incentive options or common stock. The Company had granted 3,295,000 of these shares to current
employees and directors of the Company as of September 30, 2016. The options have an exercise price from $1.29 to $3.44 per
share. The options vest monthly over four years, with some options subject to a one year cliff before options begin to vest
monthly. 

On February 23, 2015, the Company adopted
the AntriaBio, Inc. 2015 Non Qualified Stock Option Plan which allows the Company to issue up to 6,850,000 of common stock in the
form of stock options. The Company had granted 4,397,000 of these shares to current employees and directors of the Company as of
June 30, 2016 and granted an additional 90,000 of these shares to current employees as of September 30, 2016. The options have
an exercise price of from $1.00 to $2.06 per share. The options vest monthly over 4 years with some options subject to a one year
cliff before options begin to vest monthly. 

On October 31, 2016, the
Company adopted the AntriaBio, Inc. 2016 Non Qualified Stock option plan which allows the Company to issue upto 35 million of
common stock in the form of stock options. In November 2016, company granted 28,210,000 of these shares to current employees
and directors of the Company. 

AntriaBio has computed the fair value of
all options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In order to calculate the fair value of the options, certain
assumptions are made regarding components of the model, including the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock, risk-free
interest rate, volatility, expected dividend yield and expected option life. Changes to the assumptions could cause significant
adjustments to valuation. AntriaBio estimated a volatility factor utilizing a comparable published volatility of several peer companies.
Due to the small number of option holders and all options being to officers and/or directors, AntriaBio has estimated a forfeiture
rate of zero as the value of each option holder is calculated individually. AntriaBio estimates the expected term based on the
average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield in effect at the time of the grant for treasury securities of similar maturity. 

11  

AntriaBio has computed the fair value of
all options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016 using the following assumptions: 

Expected volatility    
        74  %  
 
     Risk free interest rate    
        1.46  %  
 
     Expected term (years)    
        7     
 
     Dividend yield    
        0  %  

AntriaBio has computed the fair value of
all options granted during the year ended June 30, 2016 using the following assumptions: 

Stock option activity is as follows: 

Stock-based compensation expense related
to the fair value of stock options was included in the statement of operations as research and development   compensation
and benefits expense of $304,969 and $307,337 and as general and administrative   compensation and benefits expense of $584,059
and $673,013 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The unrecognized stock-based compensation expense
at September 30, 2016 is $7,086,690. AntriaBio determined the fair value as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing method and expenses the fair value ratably over the vesting period.

through September 2021 in connection with the issuance of units in private placements. The Company issued warrants to the placement
agent to purchase 269,240 shares of common stock at a price of $1.65 per share. 

The warrants exercisable for the 66,667
shares of common stock are accounted for under liability accounting for the shares that have vested and were recorded at their
fair value on the date of issuance of $50,365 as a liability and as professional fees and investor relation expense. Warrants for
30,000 shares of common stock were cancelled as of December 31, 2015 as the vesting events had not occurred. The fair value as
of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were $2,543 and $11,955, respectively which is reflected as a liability with the fair value
adjustment recorded as derivative gains or losses on the consolidated statements of operations. 

The warrants exercisable for the 5,897,677
shares of common stock were accounted for under equity treatment and fair valued as of the date of issuance. The fair value of
the warrants was valued at $3,497,914 and was recorded into additional paid-in capital. The warrants exercisable for the 3,043,558
shares of common stock were accounted for under equity treatment and were recorded at the allocated fair value as of the date of
issuance. The estimated fair value of the warrants was $1,667,630 and the allocated fair value of $1,202,336 was recorded into
additional paid-in capital.

The warrants exercisable for 184,490 shares
of common stock were accounted for under equity treatment and were fair valued as of the date of issuance. The fair value of the
warrants was valued at $184,673 and recorded as additional paid-in-capital and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as issuance
costs. On June 24, 2016, the warrants were modified and in place of the warrants to purchase 184,490 shares were replaced by warrants
to purchase 327,046 shares of common stock. The change in the fair value between the old warrants and the new warrants on the date
of modification was calculated as $113,521 and was recorded as additional paid-in-capital and as issuance costs. The warrants exercisable
for 87,500 shares of common stock were accounted for under equity treatment and were fair valued as of the date of issuance. The
fair value of the warrants was valued as $65,490 as additional paid-in-capital and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as issuance
costs. The warrants exercisable for 519,093 shares of common stock were accounted for under equity treatment and were fair valued
as of the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants was valued at $386,800 and recorded as additional paid-in-capital and
as issuance costs. 

The warrants exercisable for the 9,000
shares of common stock were accounted for under the equity treatment and were fair valued as of the date of issuance. The fair
value of the warrants was valued at $11,407 and recorded as additional paid-in-capital and investor relations. The additional warrants
exercisable for the 24,000 shares of common stock were accounted for under the equity treatment and were fair valued as of the
date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants was valued at $20,943 and recorded as additional paid-in-capital and investor
relations. The warrants exercisable for the 60,000 shares of common stock were accounted for under the equity treatment and were
fair valued as of the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants was valued at $34,122 and recorded as additional paid-in-capital
and investor relations. The warrants exercisable for the 10,000 shares of common stock were accounted for under the equity treatment
and fair valued as of the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants was valued as $6,500 and recorded as additional paid-in-capital
and investor relations. 

The warrants exercisable for the 1,420,591
shares of common stock were accounted for under equity treatment and were recorded at the allocated fair value as of the date of
issuance. The estimated fair value of the warrants was $1,011,085 and the allocated fair value of $517,350 was recorded into additional
paid-in capital. The warrants exercisable for 269,240 shares of common stock were accounted for under equity treatment and were
fair valued as of the date of issuance. The fair value of the warrants was valued at $225,510 and recorded as additional paid-in-capital
and as issuance costs. 

These warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model on the date of issuance. In order to calculate the fair value of the warrants, certain assumptions were made
regarding components of the model, including the closing price of the underlying common stock, risk-free interest rate, volatility,
expected dividend yield, and warrant term. Changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to valuation. AntriaBio
estimated a volatility factor utilizing comparable published volatilities of several peer companies. The risk-free interest rate
is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for treasury securities of similar maturity. 

The Black-Scholes valuation methodology
was used because that model embodies all of the relevant assumptions that address the features underlying these instruments. Significant
assumptions for the warrants issued for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows: 

Significant assumptions for the warrants
issued for the year ended June 30, 2016 were as follows:

Note 10 Income Taxes   

Income tax expense during interim periods
is based on applying an estimated annual effective income tax rate to year-to-date income, plus any significant unusual or infrequently
occurring items which are recorded in the interim period. The computation of the annual estimated effective tax rate at each interim
period requires certain estimates and significant judgment including, but not limited to, the expected operating income for the
year, projections of the proportion of income earned and taxed in various jurisdictions, permanent and temporary differences, and
the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets generated in the current year. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision
for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is obtained, additional information becomes known or as the tax
environment changes. 

In the three months ended September 30,
2016, the Company did not record any income tax provision due to expected future losses and full valuation allowance on its deferred
tax assets. 

Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies   

Lease Commitments    In May
2014, the Company entered into a lease of approximately 27,000 square feet of office, laboratory and clean room space to be leased
for seventy two months. The lease requires monthly payments of $28,939 adjusted annually by approximately 3% plus triple net expenses
monthly of $34,381 adjusted annually. The Company also made a security deposit of $750,000 which is held by the landlord, of which
$253,433 has been returned to the Company and the remaining balance will be returned gradually over the next several years. 

As of September 30, 2016, the minimum rental
commitment under the lease is as follows: 

Legal
Matters  - From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of operations in the
normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, there were no pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected
to have a material effect on the results of our operations. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or
affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholders, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.  

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

General 

This discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and related notes. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. 

15  

Summary 

Since inception, we have raised over $40
million, which has enabled us to advance our microsphere platform, including completing preclinical studies for our lead product
candidate, AB101, a potential once-weekly injectable basal insulin for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We continue to
believe that AB101 s unique human insulin based formulation has the potential to significantly disrupt the annual $11 billion
basal insulin market that is dominated by daily injections of insulin analogs. Our primary objective is to manufacture clinical
material in our Louisville, Colorado facility and to commence a clinical study at a contract research organization in Southern
California. In order to achieve this objective, we will need to demonstrate that the formulation meets the intended specification
at clinical scale, certify the sterility of our manufacturing process and raise additional capital. 

Capital Requirements  

Given our ongoing financial needs as well
as our desired strategy to advance AB101 while scaling the business to include additional product candidates, we have reached a
point in our evolution where we believe we need to raise capital in a different manner by conducting a relatively large institutionally
focused round before the end of calendar year 2016. Fortunately, we have received a great deal of interest from the Korean investment
community including large, sophisticated healthcare funds. We are currently in the process of meeting with various groups to determine the level of interest by Korean
investors and funds. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If Korean
investments do not formalize then the Company will need to explore alternative financing options. 

Concurrent with our planned capital raise
in the 4th quarter of calendar year 2016, we are in the process of establishing a subsidiary in Seoul which will be led by our
Founder and Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board, Dr. Hoyoung Huh. We plan to expand our core capabilities by tapping into
the scientific prowess and know how that exists in Korea. In addition, we may also seek to in-license or acquire technologies and/or
product candidates that complement our existing pipeline. 

AB101 Update  

In accordance with the initial feedback
that we received from the FDA in 2015, as a precursor to filing an IND and starting a clinical study, we conducted a six-month
stability study of the drug substance (PEGylated insulin) used in AB101, which was satisfactorily completed in June 2016. We also
met face-to-face with the FDA in the 2nd quarter of calendar year 2016 in a pre-IND meeting to discuss our Phase 1 clinical study
design. Notably, given the complexity of microsphere products, the agency advised us to ensure that our manufacturing process was
robust before filing our IND and commencing a clinical study. 

We have constructed a $3.2 million GMP
sterile manufacturing suite in our Louisville, Colorado facility to produce AB101 material suitable for injection into patients.
Based on the guidance received from the FDA and introduction of a senior manufacturing leader to the Louisville site, in calendar
year 2016 we have been methodically engineering, testing and certifying the processes to be used in clinical manufacturing, to
include the sterility assurance of the process and product as mandated by the FDA. In the 3rd quarter of calendar year 2016 we
have successfully demonstrated our process by manufacturing sample batches of AB101 material at clinical scale. This has been a
significant and complex scientific and engineering undertaking, as prior to this calendar year we had only manufactured AB101 in
small non-sterile batches in our laboratories for use in animal studies and for analytical purposes. Furthermore, as part of our
testing process we made adjustments to certain equipment, including further customization in specific instances.
This combined endeavor, coupled with delays that we have experienced in receiving specialized parts and equipment from third party
suppliers, contributed to extending the timeline that we established in calendar year 2015 to commence clinical studies. 

16  

We have made significant progress in
demonstrating that we can manufacture AB101 at clinical scale, and we are finalizing our sterility assurance campaign, which
will demonstrate that our manufacturing process can be conducted in a sterile fashion prior to making AB101 material for the
clinical study, a fundamental and mandated exercise to ensure patient safety in the clinic. Qualifying the sterility of a
manufacturing process and environment is generally complex and particularly so when manufacturing microsphere products as
AB101 cannot be sterile filtered as is common with most injectable products. Prior to the end of 1 st  quarter
of calendar year 2017, we are planning to have completed a capital raise and have our facility fully qualified to enable the
manufacture of clinical material. Following the financing and manufacturing campaign, we will plan to file an IND with the
FDA and commence the clinical study in the first half of calendar year 2017. 

Significant Accounting Policies and
Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting
period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to the estimated useful
lives and impairment of depreciable assets, the fair value of share-based payments and warrants, fair value of derivative instruments,
income tax valuation allowances and contingencies. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on
various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates, and judgments used by us in applying these
most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. 

Results of Operations 

For Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 and 2015  

Results of operations for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 (the  2017 quarter ) and the three months ended September 30, 2015 (the  2016 quarter )
reflected losses of $3,815,867 and $3,287,950, respectively. 

17  

Revenues   

We are a preclinical stage company and
have not generated any revenues since inception. 

Expenses   

Research and development costs include
salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; consultants and outside costs; material manufacturing costs; and facilities and
other costs. Research and development costs were approximately $2,486,000 in the 2017 quarter compared to $1,968,000 in the 2016
quarter. The main increase is due to the Company continuing to hire significant staff to manufacture clinical material during the
2017 quarter. 

General and administrative costs were approximately
$1,338,000 in the 2017 quarter compared to $1,331,000 in the 2016 quarter. The general and administrative costs have remained fairly
consistent as most of these costs are fixed and remain fairly consistent from quarter to quarter. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

As of September 30, 2016, we have approximately
$3.4 million in cash on hand and working capital of approximately $2.2 million. During the year ended June 30, 2016, we closed
on a Series A Preferred Stock Offering in which we issued Series A Preferred Stock. On June 24, 2016, with the consent of the Series
A Stockholders all of the Series A Preferred Stock was converted to common stock and warrants. During the year ended June 30, 2016,
we also closed on an equity transaction in which we issued units consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase
either one-half or one share of common stock. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we performed additional closes
on the equity transaction from June 30, 2016. 

The Company received net proceeds of
approximately $14.7 million from the transactions above. While we do have cash on hand, we anticipate that we will need an
additional $10 million to cover operating expenses, clinical trials of AB101 and continuing research and development of our
product pipeline through the calendar year end 2017. We are currently evaluating raising additional capital to fund our
current and future operations. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. 

Going Concern 

The continuation of our business is dependent
upon obtaining further financing and achieving a break even or profitable level of operations in our business. The issuance of
additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current or future stockholders.
Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing through either private placements, and/or bank financing
or other loans necessary to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any
private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital.
No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements included in this Form 10-Q regarding the impact of certain accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Accounting Officer (our principal accounting
officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation and the material weakness described below,
our management concluded that we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 in ensuring
that information that we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that it is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management has identified control deficiencies
regarding a lack of segregation of duties, a need for a stronger internal control environment, and minimal review of complex accounting
issues. Our management believes that these deficiencies, which in the aggregate constitute a material weakness, are due to the
small size of our staff, which makes it challenging to maintain adequate disclosure controls. 

Changes in internal controls over
financial reporting 

During the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) or
15(d)-15(f)) that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Certain factors exist which may affect
the Company s business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.
The Company has not experienced any material changes from those risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2016 (the  Form 10-K ) except
as added below. 

Operations outside the United States
may be affected by different local politics, business and cultural factors, different regulatory requirements and prohibitions
between jurisdictions.   

Operations outside the United States may
be affected by different local business and cultural factors, different regulatory requirements and prohibitions between jurisdictions,
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments; and changes in regulatory requirements
for financing activities. 

We are currently in the process of establishing
a wholly-owned subsidiary in the Republic of Korea (South Korea).  Our operations, once established, will be subject to various
political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties inherent to the country.  Among other risks, the registrant s
operations are subject to the risks of political conditions and governmental regulations.  If there are any changes to government
regulations that affect our ability to operate, we may face significant losses. 

19  

The persistently weak global economic
and financial environment in many countries and increasing political and social instability may have a material adverse effect
on our results.   

Many of the world s largest economies
and financial institutions continue to be impacted by a weak ongoing global economic and financial environment, with some continuing
to face financial difficulty, liquidity problems and limited availability of credit. It is uncertain how long these effects will
last, or whether economic and financial trends will worsen or improve. Such uncertain times may have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations, financial condition and, if circumstances worsen, our ability to raise capital at reasonable rates. 

In addition, the varying effects of difficult
economic times on the economies, currencies and financial markets of different countries could unpredictably impact, the conversion
of our operating results into our reporting currency, the US dollar. Alternately, inflation could accelerate, which could lead
to higher interest rates, which would increase our costs of raising capital. 

In addition, increasing political and social
instability around the world may lead to significant business disruptions or other adverse business conditions. Similarly, increased
scrutiny of corporate taxes and executive pay may lead to significant business disruptions or other adverse business conditions,
and may interfere with our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in South Korea. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED
SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

On October 7, 2016 and October 13, 2016,
the Company completed an additional close and a final close of a private placement transaction (the    PIPE Financing   )
with investors (each an    Investor    and collectively, the    Investors   ) pursuant
to Section 4(a)(2) of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. 
In connection with the Close, we entered into Purchase Agreements by and between us and each Investor in which we issued to the
Investors Class A Units.  Each Class A Unit was priced at $1.10 and consisted of one share of our common stock (an    Offered
Share   ) and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (a    Warrant   ) exercisable at
$1.65 per share of our common stock (the    Warrant Shares   ) at any time until 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time)
on the date that is sixty (60) months following the Close of the PIPE Financing.   We issued an aggregate of 959,091
Units and received gross cash proceeds of $1.1 million, excluding placement agent compensation, transaction costs, fees and expenses. 

Financing Warrants  

As part of the close, we issued to the
Placement Agent a warrant (the    Financing Warrant   ) pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and Rule 506
promulgated thereunder.  The Financing Warrant is exercisable for a period of seven (7) years from the date of issuance with
an exercise price of $1.65 per share.  The Financing Warrant contains cashless exercise rights and shall be adjusted both
as to the number of shares and price to which they are exercisable, based on any splits, conversions, or reorganizations that affect
the Company s common stock. 

Note Conversion  

On October
7, 2016, one convertible note holder elected to convert their note and accrued interest to common stock based on the original 
terms of the note. The note holder converted their note into 58,350 shares of common stock.
