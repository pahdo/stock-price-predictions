  All amounts included in the following Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in thousands, except per share data or as otherwise noted. 
   
  Note   1  . Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
  Description of Business 
  MSG Networks Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company )   owns and operates two regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network ("MSGN") and MSG+, collectively the  MSG Networks.     
  The Company was incorporated on July 29, 2009 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation ( Cablevision ).  On February 9, 2010, Cablevision spun off the Company and the Company thereby acquired the subsidiaries of Cablevision that owned, directly and indirectly, all of the partnership interests in MSGN Holdings, L.P., formerly MSG Holdings L.P. ( MSGN L.P. ).  MSGN L.P. was the indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision through which Cablevision held the Madison Square Garden businesses.  MSGN L.P. is now our wholly-owned subsidiary, through which we conduct substantially all of the business activities. 
  On September 30, 2015 (the  Distribution Date ), the Company distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of The Madison Square Garden Company (formerly MSG Spinco, Inc., and referred to herein as  MSG ) (the  Distribution ).  MSG owns, directly or indirectly, the sports and entertainment businesses previously owned and operated by the Company's sports and entertainment segments, owns, leases or operates the arenas and other venues previously owned, leased or operated by the Company and owns the joint venture interests previously owned by the Company.  In the Distribution, each holder of the Company s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A Common Stock"), of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on September 21, 2015 (the  Record Date ), received one share of MSG Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every three shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock held on the Record Date.    Each record holder of the Company s Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, ("Class B Common Stock") received one share of MSG Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every three shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock held on the Record Date.  Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of MSG for purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of MSG have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the Distribution Date. 
  After giving effect to the Distribution, the Company operates and reports financial information in   one   segment. Substantially all revenues and assets of the Company are attributed to or located in the United States and are primarily concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area. 
  Unaudited Interim Financial Statements 
  The accompanying interim consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . The financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management such financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for future interim periods or for the full year.

Note   2  . Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of MSG Networks Inc. and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  See Note   3   for a discussion of media rights recognized as revenues by MSG from the licensing of team-related programming to the Company. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.  These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses.  Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, tax accruals and other liabilities. In addition, estimates are used in revenue recognition, income tax expense, performance and share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, litigation matters and other matters.  Management believes its use of estimates in the consolidated financial statements to be reasonable. 
  Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the general economic environment and actions it may take in the future.  The Company adjusts such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, these estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision.  In addition, these estimates are based on management's best judgment at a point in time and as such, these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results.  Changes in estimates resulting from weakness in the economic environment or other factors beyond the Company's control could be material and would be reflected in the Company's financial statements in future periods. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-05,   Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40):     Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  , which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract and expense the cost as the services are received.  This standard was adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and will be applied prospectively   to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date.   There was no impact to the financial statements as a result of this adoption.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which changes several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. This standard was early adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The adoption of this standard resulted in: (i) all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies being recognized in the income statement, rather than additional paid-in capital, on a prospective basis (ii) excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies no longer being classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as a financing activity, on a prospective basis (as such prior period amounts have not been adjusted) and (iii) the Company s election to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures over the course of a vesting period, on a modified retrospective basis. There was no material impact to the financial statements as a result of this adoption.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the   FASB issued ASU     No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  .  This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The   ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year.   In March 2016, the   FASB issued ASU   No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):   Principal versus Agent Consideration  s  , which provides clarification on the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations outlined in   ASU   No. 2014-09. In April 2016, the   FASB issued ASU   No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which finalized a  mendments to identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   R  evenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which clarifies assessing collectibility, noncash consideration, presentation of sales taxes, completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. Early adoption is permitted and the Company can early adopt ASU No. 2014-09 and the related updates beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.  If the Company does not apply the early adoption provision, ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using one of two retrospective application methods.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  , Leases (Topic 842)  , which requires   the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those   leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP.    The amended guidance also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases in order to provide additional information about the nature of an organization s leasing activities.    This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.  This standard will be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.    
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which amends ASC 230 to eliminate the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues.   This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted and the retrospective approach required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Note   3  . Discontinued Operations 
  As a result of the Distribution, the results of the Company s MSG operations through the Distribution Date, as well as transaction costs related to the Distribution, have been classified in the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.    No   gain or loss was recognized in connection with the Distribution. Operating results of discontinued operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are summarized below:   

           (a) 
    Includes rights fees for New York Knicks (     Knicks     ) and New York Rangers (     Rangers     ) programming prior to the Distribution Date, which were previously eliminated in consolidation. However, the pre-Distribution Date amounts are presented as revenues in the loss from discontinued operations line with the offsetting expense in direct operating expenses, within continuing operations, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
       
  Prior to the Distribution, the Company's collections for ticket sales, sponsorships and suite rentals in advance were recorded as deferred revenue and were recognized as revenues when earned for both accounting and tax purposes.  In connection with the reorganization transactions related to the Distribution, the tax recognition on most of these deferred revenues was accelerated to the date of the reorganization.  The impact of the acceleration of such deferred revenue is reflected in income tax expense of discontinued operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The net impact of the Distribution to the Company's stockholders' equity (deficiency) includes cash distributed with MSG of   $1,467,093  . 

Note 4. Computation of Earnings (Loss) per Common Share 
  Basic earnings (loss) per common share ( EPS ) is based upon net income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the effect of the assumed vesting of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and exercise of stock options only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the weighted-average number of shares used in the calculations of basic and diluted EPS.   

Note 5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
  During the   first   quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill, and there was   no   impairment of goodwill identified. 
  The Company's intangible assets subject to amortization are as follows:    

Affiliate relationships have an estimated useful life of   24   years.  Amortization expense for intangible assets for continuing operations was   $865   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Note   6  . Property and Equipment 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , property and equipment consisted of the following assets:    

Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was   $1,713   and   $3,814   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which, for the prior fiscal year period, includes depreciation expense on certain corporate property and equipment that was transferred to MSG in connection with the Distribution, but which did not qualify for discontinued operations reporting.  
   
  Note   7  . Debt 
  On September 28, 2015, MSGN L.P., MSGN Eden, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company and the general partner of MSGN L.P., Regional MSGN Holdings LLC, a direct subsidiary of the Company and the limited partner of MSGN L.P. (collectively with MSGN Eden, LLC, the  Holdings Entities ), and certain subsidiaries of MSGN L.P. entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders.

     Table of Contents  
  MSG NETWORKS INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  (Continued) 

The Credit Agreement provides MSGN L.P. with senior secured credit facilities (the  Senior Secured Credit Facilities ) consisting of: (a) an initial     $1,550,000     term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ) and (b) a     $250,000     revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), each with a term of five years.  In connection with the Distribution,     $1,450,000     of the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility was contributed to MSG immediately following the closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.    Up to   $35,000     of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. 
  Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and limitations, the Credit Agreement allows for the addition of incremental term and/or revolving loan commitments and incremental term and/or revolving loans.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which at the option of MSGN L.P. may be either (a) base rate, representing the higher of: (i) the New York Fed Bank Rate plus   0.50%  ; (ii) the U.S. Prime Rate; or (iii) the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus   1.00%   (the  Base Rate ), plus an additional rate ranging from   0.50%   to   1.25%   per annum (determined based on a total leverage ratio), or (b) a Eurodollar rate (the  Eurodollar Rate ) plus an additional rate ranging from   1.50%   to   2.25%   per annum (determined based on a total leverage ratio), provided that for the period until the delivery of the compliance certificate for the period ending   March 31, 2016  , the additional rate used in calculating both floating rates was (i)   1.00%   per annum for borrowings bearing interest at the Base Rate, and (ii)   2.00%   per annum for borrowings bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate.  Upon a payment default in respect of principal, interest or other amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement or related loan documents, default interest will accrue on all overdue amounts at an additional rate of   2.00%   per annum.  The Credit Agreement requires MSGN L.P. pay a commitment fee of   0.30%     in respect of the average daily unused commitments, as well as fronting fees, to banks that issue letters of credit pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility. 
  The Credit Agreement generally requires the Holding Entities and MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio of 6.00:1.00 from the closing date until September 30, 2016 and a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.50:1.00 from and after October 1, 2016 until maturity, subject, in each case, to upward adjustment during the continuance of certain events.  In addition, there is a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00 for the Holdings Entities, MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.    As of   September 30, 2016  ,   the Holding Entities and MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.  All borrowings under the Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including absence of a default and accuracy of representations and warranties.  As of     September 30, 2016  , there were   no     letters of credit issued and outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, which provides full borrowing capacity of     $250,000  .  The Company has made principal payments aggregating   $72,500   through   September 30, 2016  , which reduced the principal amount of the initial Term Loan Facility for subsequent amortization.  The Term Loan Facility amortizes quarterly in accordance with its terms from   September 30, 2016   through June 30, 2020 with a final maturity date on September 28, 2020. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the principal repayments required under the Term Loan Facility are as follows: 

All obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Holdings Entities and MSGN L.P. s existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are not designated as excluded subsidiaries or unrestricted subsidiaries (the  Subsidiary Guarantors,  and together with the Holdings Entities, the  Guarantors ).  All obligations under the Credit Agreement, including the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by certain of the assets of MSGN L.P. and each Guarantor (collectively,  Collateral ), including, but not limited to, a pledge of the equity interests in MSGN L.P. held directly by the Holdings Entities and the equity interests in each Subsidiary Guarantor held directly or indirectly by MSGN L.P.  Subject to customary notice and minimum amount conditions, MSGN L.P. may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (except for customary breakage costs with respect to Eurodollar loans). MSGN L.P. is required to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances, including without limitation from the net cash proceeds of certain sales of assets (including Collateral) or casualty insurance and/or condemnation recoveries (subject to c

ertain reinvestment, repair or replacement rights) and the incurrence of certain indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions.  
  In addition to the financial covenants previously discussed, the Credit Agreement and the related security agreement contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.

management does not believe that resolution of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Note   9  . Fair Value Measurements 
  The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable.  Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity's pricing based upon their own market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels: 

Level I   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
                
    Level II   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
                
    Level III   Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable. 
       
  The following table presents for each of these hierarchy levels, the Company's assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which include cash equivalents:    

Money market accounts and time deposits are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. The carrying amount of the Company's money market accounts and time deposits approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. 
  Other Financial Instruments 
  The fair value of the Company's long-term debt (see Note   7  ) was approximately   $1,470,113   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company's long-term debt is classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy as it is valued using quoted prices of such securities for which fair value can also be derived from inputs that are readily observable.  
   
  Note   10  . Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan 
  Prior to the Distribution, the Company sponsored a non-contributory qualified cash balance retirement plan covering its non-union employees (the  MSG Cash Balance Pension Plan ) and a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering certain of its union employees (the  MSG Union Plan ).  Since March 1, 2011, the MSG Cash Balance Pension Plan has also included the assets and liabilities of a frozen (as of December 31, 2007) non-contributory qualified defined pension plan covering non-union employees hired prior to January 1, 2001. The MSG Cash Balance Pension Plan was amended to freeze participation and future benefit accruals effective December 31, 2015.  The MSG Cash Balance Pension Plan and MSG Union Plan are collectively referred to as the  MSG Pension Plans.  
  The Company currently sponsors (i) a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering certain of its union employees (the  Union Plan ), (ii) an unfunded non-contributory, non-qualified excess cash balance plan covering certain employees who participated in the MSG Cash Balance Pension Plan (the "Excess Cash Balance Plan"), and (iii) an unfunded

  (Continued) 

non-contributory non-qualified defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of certain employees who participated in an underlying qualified plan, which was merged into the MSG Cash Balance Pension Plan on March 1, 2011 (the  Excess Plan ). The Union Plan, Excess Cash Balance Plan and Excess Plan are collectively referred to as the  MSG Networks Plans.  
  As of December 31, 2015, the Excess Cash Balance Plan was amended to freeze participation and future benefit accruals. Therefore, after December 31, 2015, no employee of the Company who was not already a participant may become a participant in the plans and no further annual pay credits will be made for any future year.  Existing account balances under the plans will continue to be credited with monthly interest in accordance with the terms of the plans.  As of December 31, 2007, the Excess Plan was amended to freeze all benefits earned through December 31, 2007 and to eliminate the ability of participants to earn benefits for future service under this plan.  Benefits payable to retirees under the Union Plan are based upon years of service and participants  compensation.  
    
  The Company also sponsors a contributory welfare plan which provides certain postretirement healthcare benefits to certain employees hired prior to January 1, 2001 who are eligible to commence receipt of early or normal Retirement Plan benefits under the MSG Cash Balance Pension Plan and their dependents, as well as certain union employees ( Postretirement Plan ).  
    
  As of the Distribution Date, the Company and MSG entered into an employee matters agreement (the  Employee Matters Agreement ) which determined each company s obligations after the Distribution with regard to historic liabilities under the Company s former pension and postretirement plans. Under the Employee Matters Agreement, the assets and liabilities of the MSG Pension Plans have been transferred to MSG. In addition, the following have been transferred to MSG: liabilities related to (i) current MSG employees who are active participants in the Excess Plan and/or the Excess Cash Balance Plan, (ii) current MSG employees who are eligible for participation in the Postretirement Plan, and (iii) former MSG employees who are retired participants in the Postretirement Plan. The Company has retained liabilities related to (i) its current employees and former employees of the Company or MSG who are active participants in the Excess Plan and/or the Excess Cash Balance Plan, (ii) its current employees who are eligible for participation in the Postretirement Plan, (iii) its former employees who are retired participants in the Postretirement Plan, and (iv) the Union Plan. 
  Components of net periodic benefit cost for the MSG Networks Plans, MSG Pension Plans, and Postretirement Plan recognized in direct operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, and loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:

In addition, prior to the Distribution, the Company sponsored the MSG Holdings, L.P. 401(k) Savings Plan (the "MSG Savings Plan") and the MSG Holdings, L.P. Excess Savings Plan ("Excess Savings Plan").  As a result of the Distribution, the MSG Savings Plan was amended to (i) transfer sponsorship of the plans to MSG, and (ii) become a multiple employer plan in which both MSG and the Company will continue to participate. Pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, liabilities relating to current MSG employees who were active participants in the Company's Excess Savings Plan have been transferred to MSG. The Excess Savings Plan has been renamed the MSGN Holdings, L.P. Excess Savings Plan (together with the MSG Savings Plan, the "Savings Plans").  Expenses related to the Savings Plans included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:     

Note   11  . Share-based Compensation 
    
  See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016   for more information regarding the Company's 2010 Employee Stock Plan, as amended (the "Employee Stock Plan") and 2010 Stock Plan For Non-Employee Directors, as amended (the "Non-Employee Director Plan"), as well as certain share-based payment awards granted prior to July 1, 2015. 
    
  Share-based compensation expense, presented within selling, general and administrative expenses and direct operating expenses, for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1,776   and   $4,247  , respectively. Share-based compensation expense for discontinued operations during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   was   $808  .  
    
  Stock Options Award Activity 
  In September 2016, the Company granted   1,069   stock options, of which   50%   are subject to   three-year   ratable vesting and the remaining   50%   are subject to three-year cliff vesting and the achievement of certain Company performance criteria.  These options have an expiration period of   7.5   years.  The exercise price of these options is   $17.81  . 
    
  The Company calculated the fair value of these options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which resulted in a grant date fair value of   $4.49   per option.  
    
  The following were the key assumptions used to calculate the fair value of this award: 
  
   15 

     Table of Contents  
  MSG NETWORKS INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
  (Continued) 

The Company's computation of expected term was calculated using the simplified method (the average of the vesting period and option term) as prescribed in the guidance now codified under ASC Topic 718-10-S99. The Company's computation of expected volatility was based on historical volatility of its common stock. 
  Restricted Share Units Award Activity 
  The following table summarizes activity relating to holders (including Company and MSG employees) of the Company's RSUs for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

The RSUs granted during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   included   169   RSUs that are subject to   three-year   ratable vesting and   169   RSUs subject to three-year cliff vesting. 
  The fair value of RSUs that vested during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $4,288  . Upon delivery, RSUs granted under the Employee Stock Plan were net share-settled to cover the required statutory tax withholding obligations and the remaining number of shares were issued from the Company's treasury shares. To fulfill the employees' statutory minimum tax withholding obligations for the applicable income and other employment taxes,   124   of these RSUs, with an aggregate value of   $2,254  , were retained by the Company and the taxes paid are reflected as a financing activity in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .

  Related party transactions included in     continuing operations 
  Rights fees 
  The Company's media rights agreements with the Knicks and the Rangers, effective as of July 1, 2015, provide the Company with exclusive media rights to team games in their local markets. Prior to the Distribution, these rights fees were eliminated in consolidation; however the amounts recorded prior to the Distribution are presented as revenues in the loss from discontinued operations line with the offsetting expense in direct operating expenses within continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.  Rights fees included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were   $33,800   and   $32,500  , respectively. 
  Origination, master control and technical services 
  AMC Networks provides certain origination, master control and technical services to the Company.  Amounts charged to the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were   $1,448   and   $1,417  , respectively.  
  Commission  
  The Company entered into an advertising sales representation agreement with MSG, which has a seven year term, pursuant to which MSG has the exclusive right and obligation to sell certain advertising availabilities on our behalf for a commission. All of the Company's advertising sales personnel were transferred to MSG in connection with the Distribution.

  Related party transactions with Cablevision Systems Corporation 
  Prior to June 21, 2016, members of the Dolan family were also the controlling stockholders of Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision"). On June 21, 2016, Cablevision was acquired by a subsidiary of Altice N.V. and a change in control occurred which resulted in members of the Dolan family no longer being controlling stockholders of Cablevision (now known as Altice USA). Accordingly, Altice USA is not a related party of the Company. Revenues (primarily from the distribution of programming networks to subsidiaries of Cablevision) and operating expenses that relate to Cablevision prior to its sale, included in continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were   $39,778   and   $1,852  , respectively.

  (Continued) 

Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $25,258   differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income due principally to the impact of state and local income taxes (net of federal benefit) of   $4,688   and other items of   $99  . These increases were partially offset by the impact of the tax benefits of the domestic production activities deduction of   $1,873  , tax return to book provision adjustment in connection with the filing of the Company's federal income tax return of   $623  . 
  Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   of   $404   differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income due principally to a reduction in state tax rates used to value deferred taxes resulting from the Distribution of   $16,941   and the tax benefits of the domestic production activities deduction of   $1,049  . These decreases were partially offset by state and local income taxes of   $2,798   (net of federal benefit), and other items of   $464  .  
    
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , income taxes paid by the Company were   $24,450   and   $3  , respectively. 
    
  During the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Internal Revenue Service notified the Company of its intent to review the federal income tax returns as filed for the tax year ended December 31, 2013.

  Introduction 
  MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016   to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.  Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to  we,   us,   our,  or the  Company  refer collectively to MSG Networks Inc., a holding company, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries through which substantially all of our operations are conducted.  The Company   owns and operates two regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network ("MSGN") and MSG+, collectively the  MSG Networks.  
  On September 30, 2015 (the  Distribution Date ), the Company distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of The Madison Square Garden Company (formerly MSG Spinco, Inc., and referred to herein as  MSG ) (the  Distribution ).  MSG owns, directly or indirectly, the sports and entertainment businesses previously owned and operated by the Company's sports and entertainment segments, owns, leases or operates the arenas and other venues previously owned, leased or operated by the Company and owns the joint venture interests previously owned by the Company.  In the Distribution, each holder of the Company s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, ("Class A Common Stock"), of record as of the close of business, New York City time, on September 21, 2015 (the  Record Date ), received one share of MSG Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every three shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock held on the Record Date.  Each record holder of the Company s Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, ("Class B Common Stock") received one share of MSG Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for every three shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock held on the Record Date.  Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of MSG for purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of MSG have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the Distribution Date. 
  After giving effect to the Distribution, the Company operates and reports financial information in   one   segment. 
  This MD A is organized as follows: 
  Results of Operations.    This section provides an analysis of our unaudited results of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared with the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources.    This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity, an analysis of our cash flows for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared with the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , as well as certain contractual obligations. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies.    This section discusses recently issued accounting pronouncements, as well as the results of the Company's annual impairment testing of goodwill performed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.  This section should be read together with our critical accounting policies, which are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016   under  Item 7.

Results of Operations 
  Comparison of the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   versus the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
   
  Consolidated Results of Operations 
  The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues.    

_________________  
  NM   Percentage is not meaningful 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the reported financial results of the Company reflect the results of the sports and entertainment businesses of MSG as discontinued operations. In addition, results from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 include certain corporate overhead expenses that that the Company did not incur in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and does not expect to incur in future periods, but which do not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations. The reported financial results of the Company for the periods after the Distribution reflect the Company's results on a standalone basis, including the Company s actual corporate overhead. 
  Revenues 
  Revenues for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $5,431  , or   4%  , to   $153,578   as compared with the prior year period.  The net increase is attributable to the following:    

The increase in affiliation fee revenue was primarily due to higher affiliation rates, partially offset by the impact of a low single digit percentage decrease in subscribers as compared with the prior year period. 
  Direct operating expenses 
  Direct operating expenses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $832  , or   1%  , to   $60,934   as compared with the prior year period due to higher rights fees expense of   $1,374  , partially offset by other programming-related cost decreases of   $542  .

     Table of Contents  

Selling, general and administrative expenses 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     $25,559  , or   62%  , to   $15,559   as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the absence of certain corporate overhead expenses included in the results of the prior year period.  As noted above, the fiscal 2016 first quarter results included certain corporate expenses that the Company did not incur during the current year first quarter and does not expect to incur in future periods.  Partially offsetting this decrease are corporate costs which were incurred during the fiscal 2017 first quarter by MSG Networks Inc. as a standalone public company.  
  Depreciation and amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     $2,101  , or   45%  , to   $2,578   as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the absence of depreciation expense included in the results of the prior year first quarter on certain corporate property and equipment that was transferred to MSG in connection with the Distribution, but which did not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations and, to a lesser extent, the impact of certain property and equipment being fully depreciated during fiscal 2016. 
  Interest expense, net  
  Net interest expense for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $7,567   to   $8,888   as compared with the prior year period primarily due to interest expense incurred under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities partially offset by other net decreases, including the absence of the write-off of a portion of the deferred financing costs associated with the Company's former credit facility recorded in the prior year period. 
  Income taxes  
  Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $25,258   differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income due principally to the impact of state and local income taxes (net of federal benefit) of   $4,688   and other items of   $99  . These increases were partially offset by the impact of the tax benefits of the domestic production activities deduction of   $1,873  , tax return to book provision adjustment in connection with the filing of the Company's federal income tax return of   $623  . 
  Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   of   $404   differs from the income tax expense derived from applying the statutory federal rate to pretax income due principally to a reduction in state tax rates used to value deferred taxes resulting from the Distribution of   $16,941   and the tax benefits of the domestic production activities deduction of   $1,049  . These decreases were partially offset by state and local income taxes of   $2,798   (net of federal benefit), and other items of   $464  .  
  Adjusted operating income 
  The Company evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the key financial measure is adjusted operating income (which we formerly referred to as adjusted operating cash flow).  Although the Company has renamed this non-GAAP measure, the components of adjusted operating income are identical to the components of adjusted operating cash flow.  Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income (loss) before (i) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, (ii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iii) restructuring charges or credits and (iv) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses. The Company has presented the components that reconcile adjusted operating income to operating income, a GAAP measure. 

Adjusted operating income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   $27,687  , or   54%  , to   $78,861   as compared with the prior year period primarily due to (as discussed above) lower selling, general and administrative expenses and, to a lesser extent, higher revenues partially offset by higher direct operating expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Overview 
    
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from the operations of our business and available borrowing capacity under our $  250,000   revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, which was undrawn as of   September 30, 2016   (see    Financing Agreements - Senior Secured Credit Facilities    below).  Our principal uses of cash include working capital-related items, capital spending, taxes and debt service.  The Company's use of its available liquidity will be based upon the ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, and the timing of cash flow generation.  
  We believe we have sufficient liquidity, including approximately   $155,000   in cash and cash equivalents as of   September 30, 2016  , as well as the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and our anticipated operating cash flows to fund our business operations and service our outstanding term loan (see    Financing Agreements -     Senior Secured Credit Facilities    below) over the next twelve months.  However, potential subscriber reductions of our Distributors, changes in the demand for our programming, advertising revenue declines, our ability to maintain or obtain content, and other factors could adversely impact our business and results of operations, which might require that we seek alternative sources of funding through the capital and credit markets that may or may not be available to us.  
  Financing Agreements    
    
  Senior Secured Credit Facilities    
    
  On September 28, 2015, MSGN L.P., MSGN Eden, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company and the general partner of MSGN L.P., Regional MSGN Holdings LLC, a direct subsidiary of the Company and the limited partner of MSGN L.P. (collectively with MSGN Eden, LLC, the  Holdings Entities ), and certain subsidiaries of MSGN L.P. entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with a syndicate of lenders.  
    
  The Credit Agreement provides MSGN L.P. with senior secured credit facilities (the  Senior Secured Credit Facilities ) consisting of: (a) an initial     $1,550,000      term loan facility (the  Term Loan Facility ) and (b) a   $  250,000     revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ), each with a term of five years.  In connection with the Distribution,     $1,450,000     of the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility was contributed to MSG immediately following the closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.     The remainder of the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility were used by MSGN L.P. to pay for certain fees and expenses associated with the Distribution and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the balance was designated for use to fund working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of MSGN L.P.  The Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn as of   September 30, 2016   and is available to fund working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of MSGN L.P.  Up to   $35,000     of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit.    
    
  The Credit Agreement generally requires the Holding Entities and MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to comply with a maximum total leverage ratio of 6.00:1.00 from the closing date until   September 30, 2016   and a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.50:1.00 from and after October 1, 2016 until maturity, subject, in each case, to upward adjustment during the continuance of certain events. In addition, there is a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00 for the Holdings Entities, and MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   the Holding Entities and MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement.  All borrowings under the Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including absence of a default and accuracy of representations and warranties.  As of     September 30, 2016  , there were   no     letters of credit issued and outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, which provides full borrowing capacity of     $250,000  . The Company has made principal payments aggregating $  72,500   through   September 30, 2016  , which reduced the principal amount of the initial Term Loan Facility for subsequent amortization.  The Term Loan Facility amortizes quarterly in accordance with its terms from   September 30, 2016   through June 30, 2020 with a final maturity date on September 28, 2020. 
    
  In addition to the financial covenants discussed above, the Credit Agreement and the related security agreement contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions on the ability of the Holding Entities and MSGN L.P. and its restricted subsidiaries to take certain actions as provided in (and subject to various exceptions and baskets set forth in) the Credit Agreement, including the following: (i) incurring additional indebtedness and contingent liabilities; (ii) creating liens on certain assets; (iii) making investments, loans or advances in or to other persons; (iv) paying dividends and distributions or repurchasing capital stock; (v) changing its lines of business; (vi) engaging in certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) amending specified material agreements; (viii) merging or consolidating; (ix)

making certain dispositions; and (x) entering into agreements that restrict the granting of liens. The Holdings Entities are also subject to customary passive holding company covenants. 
    
  See Note   7   to the consolidated financial statements included in "Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the Credit Agreement. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
  As more fully described in Notes   9   and   10   to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  , the Company's contractual obligations consist primarily of its obligations under media rights agreements and long-term operating lease agreements. 
    
  In addition, see Note   7   to the consolidated financial statements included in "Part I -   Item 1.   Financial Statements  " of this Quarterly Report on Form 10Q for the principal repayments required under the Company's Term Loan Facility. 

Cash Flow Discussion 
  Operating Activities     from continuing operations  
  Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $28,025   to   $50,824   as compared with the prior year period.  This decrease is primarily driven by higher income taxes paid as compared with the prior year period.  While income from continuing operations before income taxes increased as compared with the prior year period, the change in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was impacted by certain other items, including the absence of a prior period positive working capital contribution relating to the timing of the fiscal 2016 rights payments to MSG under the Knicks and Rangers media rights agreements. 
  Investing Activities from continuing operations  
  Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased by   $276   to   $1,726   as compared with the prior year period due to slightly higher capital expenditures in the current year period.  
  Financing Activities from continuing operations  
  Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased by   $16,935   to   $12,252   as compared with the prior year period primarily due to the cash distributed with MSG in connection with the Distribution and, to a lesser extent, the impact of cash used in the prior year period for repurchases of the Company s Class A Common Stock under a share repurchase program which was terminated effective as of the Distribution Date.  These decreases in net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations were largely offset by the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility received in the prior year period. 
   
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Critical Accounting Policies 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("  FASB")  issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")     No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  .  This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The   ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by one year.   In March 2016, the   FASB issued ASU   No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):   Principal versus Agent Consideration  s  , which provides clarification on the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations outlined in   ASU   No. 2014-09. In April 2016, the   FASB issued ASU   No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which finalized a  mendments to identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   R  evenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which clarifies assessing collectibility, noncash consideration, presentation of sales taxes, completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. Early adoption is permitted and the Company can early adopt ASU No. 2014-09 and the related updates beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.  If the Company does not apply the early adoption provision, ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using one of two retrospective application methods.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  , Leases (Topic 842)  , which requires   the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those   leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP.    The amended guidance also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases in order to provide additional information about the nature of an organization s leasing activities.    This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.  This standard will be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which amends ASC 230 to eliminate the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues.   This standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted and the retrospective approach required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.      
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The following discussion has been included to provide the results of our annual impairment testing of goodwill performed during the first quarter of fiscal year   2017  . There have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting policies from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . 
  Goodwill 
  The goodwill balance reported on the Company's balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   is $424,508. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of August 31   st    and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances.  After giving effect to the Distribution, the Company has one reporting unit for evaluating goodwill impairment. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If the Company can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would not need to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit. The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment of impairment.  This assessment considered factors such as:   
             
    Macroeconomic conditions; 
                
    Industry and market considerations; 
                
    Cost factors; 
                
    Overall financial performance; 
                
    Other relevant company-specific factors such as changes in management, strategy or customers; and 
                
    Relevant specific events such as changes in the carrying amount of net assets. 
     During the   first   quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill, and there was   no   impairment of goodwill identified. 
   
  Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  There were no material changes to the disclosures on this matter made in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  . 
   
  Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have performed an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In addition, no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
