      SOLAR CAPITAL LTD.    
   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)        September 30, 2016        (in thousands, except share amounts)    
   Note 1. Organization    
  Solar Capital LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, was formed in February 2007 and commenced operations on March 13, 2007 with
initial capital of $1,200,000 of which 47.04% was funded by affiliated parties.      Immediately prior to our initial public
offering, through a series of transactions, Solar Capital Ltd. merged with Solar Capital LLC, leaving Solar Capital Ltd. as the surviving entity (the  Merger ). Solar Capital Ltd. issued an aggregate of approximately 26.65 million
shares of common stock and $125,000 in senior unsecured notes to the existing Solar Capital LLC unit holders in connection with the Merger. Solar Capital Ltd. had no assets or operations prior to completion of the Merger and as a result, the
historical books and records of Solar Capital LLC have become the books and records of the surviving entity. The number of shares used to calculate weighted average shares for use in computations on a per share basis have been decreased
retroactively by a factor of approximately 0.4022 for all periods prior to February 9, 2010. This factor represents the effective impact of the reduction in shares resulting from the Merger.   
  Solar Capital Ltd. ( Solar Capital , the  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ), a Maryland
corporation formed in November 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the  1940 Act ). Furthermore, as the Company is an investment company, it continues to apply the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 946. In addition, for tax purposes, the Company has
elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).      On February 9, 2010, Solar Capital priced its initial public offering, selling 5.68 million shares, including the underwriters  over-allotment, at a price of $18.50 per share. Concurrent
with this offering, the Company s senior management purchased an additional 600,000 shares through a private placement, also at $18.50 per share.      The Company s investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. The Company invests primarily in leveraged middle market companies
in the form of senior secured loans, unitranche loans, mezzanine loans and equity securities. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies that are thinly traded.       Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies       The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The
consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the operations and financial condition for the periods presented. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts may have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.      Interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X, as

expenses during the reported periods. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ
materially. The current period s results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of results that ultimately may be achieved for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2016.   
  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for the fair presentation of
financial statements, have been included.      The significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Company are:

(a)  
  Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date;         

(b)  
  Under procedures established by our board of directors (the  Board ), we value investments, including certain senior secured debt, subordinated debt and other
debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily available, at such market quotations (unless they are deemed not to represent fair value). We attempt to obtain market quotations from at least two brokers
or dealers (if available, otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer or other independent pricing service). We utilize mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within the range is
more representative. If and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, we typically utilize independent third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value. Accordingly, such investments go through our multi-step
valuation process as described below. In each case, independent valuation firms consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations. Debt investments with maturities of 60
days or less shall each be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which is expected to approximate fair value, unless such valuation, in the judgment of Solar Capital Partners, LLC (the  Investment Adviser ),
does not represent fair value, in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board. Investments that are not publicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board. Such determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates.     
  With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to
represent fair value, our Board has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:       

(1)  
  our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser
responsible for the portfolio investment;         

(2)  
  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of the Investment Adviser;     

(3)  
  independent valuation firms engaged by our Board conduct independent appraisals and review the Investment Adviser s preliminary valuations and make their own
independent assessment for all material assets;         

(4)  
  the audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuation of the Investment Adviser and that of the independent valuation firm and responds to the valuation
recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments; and         

(5)  
  the Board discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser, the
respective independent valuation firm and the audit committee.

   September 30, 2016        (in thousands, except share amounts)        
   Investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach, an income
approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. However, in accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946, may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value.
The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts
(for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may
take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants,
call protection provisions, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of
financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are
considered as an input in the valuation process. Escrow receivables, if any, included in the receivables for investments sold in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities are reviewed quarterly and the value of the receivable is adjusted
as necessary. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change to the Company s valuation techniques and the nature of the related inputs considered in the valuation process.   
  ASC Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:   
   Level 1 : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by the Company at the measurement date.
      Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.       Level 3 :
Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.      In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair
value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety
requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. The exercise of judgment is based in part on our knowledge of the asset class and our prior experience.   

(c)  
  Gains or losses on investments are calculated by using the specific identification method.     

(d)  
  The Company records dividend income and interest, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual basis. Loan origination fees, original
issue discount, and market discounts are capitalized and we amortize such amounts into income using the effective interest method or on a straight-line basis, as applicable. Upon the prepayment of a loan, any unamortized loan origination fees are
recorded as interest income. We record call premiums received on loans repaid as interest income when we receive such amounts. Capital structuring fees, amendment fees, consent fees, and any other non-recurring fee income as well as management fee
and other fee income for services rendered, if any, are recorded as other income when earned.         

(e)  
    The Company intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code pertaining to regulated investment companies to make
distributions of taxable income sufficient to

relieve it of substantially all U.S. federal income taxes. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4% excise tax on
this income. The Company will accrue excise tax on such estimated excess taxable income as appropriate.         

(f)  
  Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are typically reclassified among the Company s
capital accounts annually. In addition, the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP.     

(g)  
  Distributions to common stockholders are recorded as of the record date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board. Net realized capital
gains, if any, are generally distributed or deemed distributed at least annually.         

(h)  
  In accordance with Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 810  Consolidation , the Company consolidates its interest in investment company subsidiaries, financing
subsidiaries and certain wholly-owned holding companies that serve to facilitate investment in portfolio companies. In addition, the Company may also consolidate any controlled operating companies substantially all of whose business consists of
providing services to the Company.         

(i)  
  The accounting records of the Company are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars
based on the rate of exchange of such currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. The Company will not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the
fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations would be included with the net unrealized gain or loss from investments. The Company s investments in foreign securities, if any, may involve certain
risks, including without limitation: foreign exchange restrictions, expropriation, taxation or other political, social or economic risks, all of which could affect the market and/or credit risk of the investment. In addition, changes in the
relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect the value of these investments in terms of U.S. dollars and therefore the earnings of the Company.     

(j)  
  The Company has made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option of accounting to its senior secured credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) and
its senior secured notes (the  Senior Secured Notes ) (see notes 6 and 8), in accordance with ASC 825-10. The Company uses an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in measuring their fair value.     

(k)  
  In accordance with ASC 835-30, the Company records origination and other expenses related to certain debt issuances as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
the debt liability. These expenses are deferred and amortized using either the effective interest method or the straight-line method over the stated life. The straight-line method may be used on revolving facilities and when it approximates the
effective yield method.         

(l)  
  The Company may enter into forward exchange contracts in order to hedge against foreign currency risk. These contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the
difference between the contract exchange rate and the current market rate as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts are settled.     

(m)  
  The Company records expenses related to shelf registration statements and applicable equity offering costs as prepaid assets. These expenses are typically charged as a
reduction of capital upon utilization, in accordance with ASC 946-20-25. Certain subsequent costs are expensed per the AICPA Audit   Accounting Guide for Investment Companies.

  Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest cash payments are past
due 30 days or more and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest cash payments will be collected. Such non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash, and in
management s judgment, are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining principal and interest obligations. Cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending on
management s judgment.         

(o)  
  The Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant
risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only securities with a maturity of three months or less would qualify, with limited exceptions. The Company believes that certain U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements
and other high-quality, short-term debt securities would qualify as cash equivalents.        Recent Accounting
Pronouncements      In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic
810) Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The update changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-02
for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU 2015-02 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-02 has not had a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.      In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation
of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-03 retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated
the impact of ASU 2015-03 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-03 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.   
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its
Equivalent). The update eliminates the requirement to categorize investments in the fair value hierarchy if their fair value is measured at net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in the FASB s fair
value measurement guidance. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-07 retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU 2015-07 on its
consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-07 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.       Note 3. Agreements       Solar Capital has an Advisory Agreement with the
Investment Adviser, under which the Investment Adviser will manage the day-to-day operations of, and provide investment advisory services to, Solar Capital. For providing these services, the Investment Adviser receives a fee from Solar Capital,
consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is determined by taking the average value of Solar Capital s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters
  
         17

SOLAR CAPITAL LTD.

   September 30, 2016        (in thousands, except share amounts)        
   
calculated at an annual rate of 2.00%. For purposes of computing the base management fee, gross assets exclude temporary assets acquired at the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of
preserving investment flexibility in the next fiscal quarter. Temporary assets include, but are not limited to, U.S. treasury bills, other short-term U.S. government or government agency securities, repurchase agreements or cash borrowings.
     The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: one part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on Solar
Capital s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees
(other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus Solar
Capital s operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but
excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains or losses, or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return
on the value of Solar Capital s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). Solar Capital pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with
respect to Solar Capital s pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which Solar Capital s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the
hurdle rate; (2) 100% of Solar Capital s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar
quarter; and (3) 20% of the amount of Solar Capital s pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter. These calculations are appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months.
     The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon
termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and will equal 20% of Solar Capital s cumulative realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses, unrealized capital depreciation (unrealized depreciation on a
gross investment-by-investment basis at the end of each calendar year) and all net capital gains upon which prior performance-based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to the Investment Adviser. For financial statement
purposes, the second part of the incentive fee is accrued based upon 20% of cumulative net realized gains and net unrealized capital appreciation. No accrual was required for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $7,318 and $21,245, respectively, in base management fees
and $4,251 and $13,363, respectively, in performance-based incentive fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized $6,254 and $18,155, respectively, in base management fees and $1,971 and $1,971, respectively,
in performance-based incentive fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, $700 and $700, respectively, of such performance-based incentive fees were waived.     Solar Capital has also entered into an Administration Agreement with Solar Capital Management, LLC (the  Administrator ) under which the Administrator provides administrative services to Solar
Capital. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, Solar Capital reimburses the Administrator for Solar Capital s allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under
the Administration Agreement, including rent. The Administrator will also provide, on Solar Capital s behalf, managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which Solar Capital is required to provide such assistance.

   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized expenses
under the Administration Agreement of $1,617 and $4,417, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized expenses under the Administration Agreement of $1,245 and $3,844, respectively. No managerial
assistance fees were accrued or collected for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.       Note 4. Net Asset Value
Per Share       At September 30, 2016, the Company s total net assets and net asset value per share were $917,563 and
$21.72, respectively. This compares to total net assets and net asset value per share at December 31, 2015 of $882,698 and $20.79, respectively.       Note 5. Earnings Per Share       The following table sets forth the
computation of basic and diluted net increase in net assets per share resulting from operations, pursuant to ASC 260-10, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   
   
     Note 6. Fair Value       Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a
framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:   
   Level     1.  Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical
assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access.   
   Level     2.  Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not
active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following:   

a)  
  Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;         

b)  
  Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets;     

c)  
  Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and     
         19

d)  
  Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability.         Level     3.  Financial assets and liabilities whose values are
based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management s and, if applicable, an independent third-party valuation firm s
own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.      When the inputs used
to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For example,
a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3).      Gains and losses for assets and liabilities categorized within the Level 3 table below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and
unobservable inputs (Level 3).      A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis.
Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are reported as transfers in/out of the appropriate category as of the end of the quarter in which
the reclassifications occur.      The following tables present the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:       Fair Value Measurements

    The Company has made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option of accounting to the Credit
Facility and the Senior Secured Notes, in accordance with ASC 825-10. On December 31, 2015, there were borrowings of $257,900 and $75,000, respectively, on the Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Notes. The Company used an independent third-party
valuation firm to assist in measuring the fair value of the Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes.        Quantitative
Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements        The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing
debt investments utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to
current contractual interest rates, relative maturities and other key terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a significant determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to the total
enterprise value of the company, and the rights and remedies of our investment within each portfolio company.      Significant
unobservable quantitative inputs typically used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily reflect current market yields, including indices, and readily available quotes from brokers, dealers, and
pricing services as indicated by comparable assets and liabilities, as well as enterprise values, returns on equity and earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) multiples of similar companies, and comparable
market transactions for equity securities.      Quantitative information about the Company s Level 3 asset and liability fair
value measurements as of September 30, 2016 is summarized in the table below:

    Significant increases or decreases in any of the above unobservable inputs in isolation, including
unobservable inputs used in deriving bid-ask spreads, if applicable, could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements for such assets and liabilities.       Note 7. Derivatives       The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk
through its investments denominated in foreign currencies. The Company may mitigate this risk through the use of foreign currency forward contracts, borrowing in local currency under its Credit Facility, or similar. As an investment company, all
changes in the fair value of assets, including changes caused by foreign currency fluctuation, flow through current earnings.   
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no open forward foreign currency contracts outstanding. The Company also had
no derivatives designated as hedging instruments at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.       Note 8. Debt    
   Unsecured Senior Notes    
  On November 16, 2012, the Company and U.S. Bank National Association entered into an Indenture and a First Supplemental Indenture
relating to the Company s issuance, offer and sale of $100,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.75% Unsecured Senior Notes due 2042 (the  Unsecured Notes ). The Unsecured Notes will mature on November 15, 2042 and may be
redeemed in whole or in part at the Company s option at any time or from time to time on or after November 15, 2017 at a redemption price of $25 per security plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of
6.75% per year payable quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year. The Unsecured Notes are direct senior unsecured obligations of the Company.  
   Revolving and Term Loan Facility       On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a second Credit Facility amendment. The Credit Facility is composed of $505,000 of revolving credit and $50,000 of term loans. Borrowings generally bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a range of 2.00-2.25% or the alternate base rate plus 1.00%-1.25%. The Credit Facility has no LIBOR floor requirement. The Credit Facility matures in September 2021 and includes

ratable amortization in the final year. The Credit Facility may be increased up to $800,000 with additional new lenders or an increase in commitments from current lenders. The Credit Facility
contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants that among other things, requires the Company to maintain a minimum shareholder s equity
and a minimum asset coverage ratio. The Company also pays issuers of funded term loans quarterly in arrears a commitment fee at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily outstanding balance. At September 30, 2016, outstanding USD
equivalent borrowings under the Credit Facility totaled $267,700.       Senior Secured Notes    
  On May 10, 2012, the Company closed a private offering of $75,000 of Senior Secured Notes with a fixed interest rate of 5.875% and a
maturity date of May 10, 2017. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is due semi-annually on May 10 and November 10. The Senior Secured Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.      Certain covenants on our issued debt may restrict our business activities,
including limitations that could hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments or to make the distributions required to maintain our status as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.   
  The Company has made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option of accounting to its Credit Facility and Senior Secured
Notes, in accordance with ASC 825-10. We believe accounting for the Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes at fair value better aligns the measurement methodologies of assets and liabilities, which may mitigate certain earnings volatility. ASC
825-10 requires entities to display the fair value of the selected assets and liabilities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and changes in fair value of the Credit Facility are reported in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.      The average annualized interest cost for all borrowings for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 was 4.03% and 5.13%, respectively. These costs are exclusive of other credit facility expenses such as unused fees, agency fees and other prepaid expenses related to establishing and/or amending the Credit
Facility, the Unsecured Notes, and the Senior Secured Notes (collectively the  Credit Facilities ), if any. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed $2,664 in conjunction with the September 2016
amendment to the Credit Facility. The maximum amounts borrowed on the Credit Facilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 were $610,900 and $434,900, respectively.

  The asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and
indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by all senior securities representing indebtedness. This asset coverage ratio is multiplied by one thousand to determine the Asset Coverage Per Unit. In order to determine the specific Asset
Coverage Per Unit for each class of debt, the total Asset Coverage Per Unit is allocated based on the amount outstanding in each class of debt at the end of the period. As of September 30, 2016, asset coverage was 307.3%.

  The amount to which such class of senior security would be entitled upon the involuntary liquidation of the issuer in preference to any security junior to it.
    
     Note 10. Crystal Financial
LLC       On December 28, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Crystal Capital Financial Holdings LLC ( Crystal
Financial ), a commercial finance company focused on providing asset-based and other secured financing solutions (the  Crystal Acquisition ). We invested $275,000 in cash to effect the Crystal Acquisition. Crystal Financial owned
approximately 98% of the outstanding ownership interest in Crystal Financial LLC. The remaining financial interest was held by various employees of Crystal Financial LLC, through their investment in Crystal Management LP. Crystal Financial LLC had a
diversified portfolio of 23 loans having a total par value of approximately $400,000 at November 30, 2012 and a $275,000 committed revolving credit facility. On January 27, 2014, the revolving credit facility was expanded to $300,000. On
March 31, 2014, we exchanged $137,500 of our equity interest in Crystal Financial in exchange for $137,500 in floating rate senior secured notes in Crystal Financial bearing interest at LIBOR plus 9.50%, maturing on March 31, 2019. On May
18, 2015, the revolving credit facility was expanded to $350,000. Our financial statements, including our schedule of investments, reflected our investments in Crystal Financial on a consolidated basis. On July 28, 2016, the Company purchased
Crystal Management LP s approximately 2% equity interest in Crystal Financial LLC for approximately $5,737. Upon the closing of this transaction, the Company holds 100% of the equity interest in Crystal Financial LLC. On September 30,
2016, Crystal Capital Financial Holdings LLC was dissolved.      As of September 30, 2016 Crystal Financial LLC had 31 funded
commitments to 29 different issuers with a total par value of approximately $481,440 on total assets of $553,169. As of December 31, 2015, Crystal Financial LLC had 28 funded commitments to 26 different issuers with a total par value of

the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Crystal Financial LLC had net income of $4,720 and $3,896, respectively, on gross income of $15,941 and $14,593, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Crystal
Financial LLC had net income of $22,384 and $21,223, respectively, on gross income of $49,004 and $42,963, respectively. Due to timing and non-cash items, there may be material differences between GAAP net income and cash available for
distributions.       Note 11. Stock Repurchase Programs       On July 31, 2013, the Board authorized a program for the purpose of repurchasing up to $100,000 of the Company s common stock. Under the repurchase program, the Company could have, but was not

    Note 13. Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program LLC    
  On September 2, 2014, the Company entered into a limited liability company agreement with an affiliate (the  Investor ) of
a fund managed by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ( PIMCO ) to co-invest in middle market senior secured unitranche loans sourced by the same origination platform used by the Company. Initial funding commitments to the unitranche
strategy total $600,000, consisting of direct equity investments and co-investment commitments as described below. The joint venture vehicle known as the Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program LLC ( SSLP ) is structured as an
unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company. The Company and the Investor initially made equity commitments to the SSLP of $300,000 and $43,250, respectively. All portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SSLP
must be approved by an investment committee of the SSLP consisting of representatives of the Company and PIMCO (with approval from a representative of each required).      On October 15, 2015, the Company entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement for its SSLP to add Voya Investment Management LLC ( Voya ), part of Voya Financial,
Inc. (NYSE: VOYA), as a partner in SSLP in place of the investor that was previously the Company s partner in SSLP, though this investor may still co-invest up to $300,000 of equity in unitranche loans alongside SSLP. This joint venture is
expected to invest primarily in senior secured unitranche loans to middle market companies predominantly owned by private equity sponsors or entrepreneurs, consistent with the Company s core origination and underwriting mandate. In addition to
the Company s prior equity commitment of $300,000 to SSLP, Voya has made an initial equity commitment of $25,000 to SSLP, with the ability to upsize.      On November 2, 2015, the Company assigned $125,000 of its $300,000 commitment to SSLP to Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program II LLC ( SSLP II ), a Delaware limited liability
company.     On November 25, 2015, SSLP commenced operations. On June 30, 2016, SSLP as transferor and SSLP 2016-1, LLC, a newly
formed wholly owned subsidiary of SSLP, as borrower entered into a $200,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the  SSLP Facility ) with Wells Fargo Bank, NA acting as administrative agent. Solar Capital Ltd. acts as servicer under
the SSLP Facility. The SSLP Facility is scheduled to mature on June 30, 2021. The SSLP Facility generally bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. SSLP and SSLP 2016-1, LLC, as applicable, have made certain customary representations and
warranties, and are required to comply with various covenants, including leverage restrictions, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The SSLP Facility also includes usual and customary events of
default for credit facilities of this nature. There were $42,550 of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, using proceeds from the SSLP Facility, SSLP returned capital totaling $28,875 and
$4,125 to the Company and Voya, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company and Voya had contributed combined equity capital in the amount of $98,871 and $92,183, respectively. Of the $98,871 of contributed equity
capital at September 30, 2016, the Company contributed $29,884 in the form of investments and $56,628 in the form of cash and Voya contributed $12,359 in the form of cash. As of September 30, 2016, the Company and Voya s remaining commitments
to SSLP totaled $88,488 and $12,641, respectively. The Company, along with Voya, controls the funding of SSLP and SSLP may not call the unfunded commitments without approval of both the Company and Voya.   
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, SSLP had total assets of $141,924 and $92,528, respectively. For the same periods,
SSLP s portfolio consisted of floating rate senior secured loans to 8 and 4 different borrowers, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, SSLP invested $5,194 in 2 portfolio companies. Investments prepaid totaled $364 for

      Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
      The Board of Directors and Stockholders      Solar Capital Ltd.:      We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated statement of
assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedule of investments, of Solar Capital Ltd. (the  Company ) as of September 30, 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the related consolidated statement of changes in net assets for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.      We conducted our
review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.      Based on our review, we
are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

  Solar Capital LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, was formed in February 2007 and commenced operations on March 13, 2007 with
initial capital of $1.2 billion of which 47.04% was funded by affiliated parties.      Solar Capital Ltd. ( Solar
Capital , the  Company ,  we  or  our ), a Maryland corporation formed in November 2007, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a
business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). Furthermore, as the Company is an investment company, it continues to apply the guidance in the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 946. In addition, for tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).      On February 9, 2010, we priced our initial public
offering, selling 5.68 million shares of our common stock. Concurrent with our initial public offering, Michael S. Gross, our chairman and chief executive officer, and   
         36

Bruce Spohler, our chief operating officer, collectively purchased an additional 0.6 million shares of our common stock through a private placement transaction exempt from registration under
the Securities Act (the  Concurrent Private Placement ).      We invest primarily in U.S. middle-market companies, where
we believe the supply of primary capital is limited and the investment opportunities are most attractive. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily
in leveraged middle-market companies in the form of senior secured loans, mezzanine loans and equity securities. From time to time, we may also invest in public companies that are thinly traded. Our business is focused primarily on the direct
origination of investments through portfolio companies or their financial sponsors. Our investments generally range between $5 million and $100 million each, although we expect that this investment size will vary proportionately with the size of our
capital base and/or with strategic initiatives. Our investment activities are managed by Solar Capital Partners, LLC (the  Investment Adviser ) and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are non-interested, as such term
is defined in the 1940 Act. Solar Capital Management, LLC (the  Administrator ) provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate.      In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in other types of investments, which we refer to as opportunistic investments, which are not our primary focus but are intended to enhance our overall
returns. These investments may include, but are not limited to, direct investments in public companies that are not thinly traded and securities of leveraged companies located in select countries outside of the United States.   
  As of September 30, 2016, the Investment Adviser has invested approximately $5.8 billion in more than 255 different portfolio companies
since 2006. Over the same period, the Investment Adviser completed transactions with more than 165 different financial sponsors.       Recent
Developments       On November 2, 2016, our Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.40 per share payable on January 4,
2017 to holders of record as of December 15, 2016.        Investments     
  Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of
debt and equity capital available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. As a BDC, we must
not acquire any assets other than  qualifying assets  specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets
include investments in  eligible portfolio companies.  The definition of  eligible portfolio company  includes certain public companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and companies whose
securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than $250 million.        Revenue
       We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the securities we hold and capital
gains, if any, on investment securities that we may sell. Our debt investments generally have a stated term of three to seven years and typically bear interest at a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark London interbank
offered rate ( LIBOR ), commercial paper rate, or the prime rate. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly but may be monthly or semi-annually. In addition, our investments may provide payment-in-kind
( PIK ) interest. Such amounts of accrued PIK interest are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer.
We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and, if applicable, consulting fees, etc.

     Expenses        All investment professionals of the investment adviser and their respective staffs, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services, and the compensation and
routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by Solar Capital Partners. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation):   

the cost of our organization and public offerings;          

the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;      

the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of our shares and other securities;      

interest payable on debt, if any, to finance our investments;      

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments, including fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence
reviews of prospective investments and advisory fees;          

transfer agent and custodial fees;

fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs;      

costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable federal and state securities laws; and

all other expenses incurred by either Solar Capital Management or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the
Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Solar Capital Management in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses
associated with performing compliance functions, and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our chief compliance officer and our chief financial officer and any administrative support staff.
        We expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase
moderately in dollar terms. During periods of asset growth, we generally expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest
expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities, among others, may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance, interest rate benchmarks, and offerings of our securities relative to comparative
periods, among other factors.       Portfolio and Investment Activity    
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we invested approximately $138.9 million across 8 portfolio companies. This
compares to investing approximately $82.5 million in 6 portfolio companies for the

  Since inception through September 30, 2016, Solar Capital and its predecessor companies have invested approximately $4.7 billion in 165
portfolio companies. Over the same period, Solar Capital has completed transactions with more than 125 different financial sponsors.   
   Crystal Financial LLC    
  On December 28, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Crystal Capital Financial Holdings LLC ( Crystal Financial ), a
commercial finance company focused on providing asset-based and other secured financing solutions (the  Crystal Acquisition ). We invested $275 million in cash to effect the Crystal Acquisition. Crystal Financial owned approximately 98% of
the outstanding ownership interest in Crystal Financial LLC. The remaining financial interest was held by various employees of Crystal Financial LLC, through their investment in Crystal Management LP. Crystal Financial LLC had a diversified
portfolio of 23 loans having a total par value of approximately $400 million at November 30, 2012 and a $275 million committed revolving credit facility. On January 27, 2014, the revolving credit facility was expanded to $300 million. On
March 31, 2014, we exchanged $137.5 million of our equity interest in Crystal Financial in exchange for $137.5 million in floating rate senior secured notes in Crystal Financial bearing interest at LIBOR plus 9.50%, maturing on March 31,
2019. On May 18, 2015, the revolving credit facility was expanded to $350 million. Our financial statements, including our schedule of investments, reflected our investments in Crystal Financial on a consolidated basis. On July 28, 2016, the Company
purchased Crystal Management LP s approximately 2% equity interest in Crystal Financial LLC for approximately $5.7 million. Upon the closing of this transaction, the Company holds 100% of the equity interest in Crystal Financial LLC. On
September 30, 2016, Crystal Capital Financial Holdings LLC was dissolved.      As of September 30, 2016, Crystal Financial LLC had
31 funded commitments to 29 different issuers with a total par value of approximately $481.4 million on total assets of $553.2 million. As of December 31, 2015, Crystal Financial LLC had 28 funded commitments to 26 different issuers with a total par
value of approximately $465.1 million on total assets of $518.3 million. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the largest loan outstanding totaling $36.1 million and $34.3 million, respectively. For the same periods, the average exposure
per issuer was $16.6 million and $17.9 million, respectively. Crystal Financial LLC s credit facility, which is non-recourse to Solar Capital, had approximately $264.9 million and $232.9 million of borrowings

outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, Crystal Financial LLC had net income of
$4.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively, on gross income of $15.9 million and $14.6 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, Crystal Financial LLC had net income of $22.4 million
and $21.2 million, respectively, on gross income of $49.0 million and $43.0 million, respectively. Due to timing and non-cash items, there may be material differences between GAAP net income and cash available for distributions. As of September
30, 2016, and based upon our expectations for Crystal Financial LLC s portfolio performance, we believe that Crystal Financial LLC will be able to maintain its dividend payments to the Company.   
   Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program LLC       On September 2, 2014, the Company entered into a limited liability company agreement with an affiliate (the  Investor ) of a fund managed by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC
( PIMCO ) to co-invest in middle market senior secured unitranche loans sourced by the same origination platform used by the Company. Initial funding commitments to the unitranche strategy total $600 million, consisting of direct equity
investments and co-investment commitments as described below. The joint venture vehicle known as the Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program LLC ( SSLP ) is structured as an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company. The Company and
the Investor initially made equity commitments to the SSLP of $300.0 million and $43.25 million, respectively. All portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of the SSLP must be approved by an investment committee of the SSLP
consisting of representatives of the Company and PIMCO (with approval from a representative of each required).      On October 15,
2015, the Company entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement for its SSLP to add Voya Investment Management LLC ( Voya ), part of Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VOYA), as a partner in SSLP in place of the
investor that was previously the Company s partner in SSLP, though this investor may still co-invest up to $300 million of equity in unitranche loans alongside SSLP. This joint venture is expected to invest primarily in senior secured
unitranche loans to middle market companies predominantly owned by private equity sponsors or entrepreneurs, consistent with the Company s core origination and underwriting mandate. In addition to the Company s prior equity commitment of
$300.0 million to SSLP, Voya has made an initial equity commitment of $25.0 million to SSLP, with the ability to upsize.      On
November 2, 2015, the Company assigned $125.0 million of its $300.0 million commitment to SSLP to Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program II LLC ( SSLP II ), a Delaware limited liability company.  
  On November 25, 2015, SSLP commenced operations. On June 30, 2016, SSLP as transferor and SSLP 2016-1, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned
subsidiary of SSLP, as borrower entered into a $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the  SSLP Facility ) with Wells Fargo Bank, NA acting as administrative agent. Solar Capital Ltd. acts as servicer under the SSLP
Facility. The SSLP Facility is scheduled to mature on June 30, 2021. The SSLP Facility generally bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. SSLP and SSLP 2016-1, LLC, as applicable, have made certain customary representations and warranties, and
are required to comply with various covenants, including leverage restrictions, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities. The SSLP Facility also includes usual and customary events of default for credit
facilities of this nature. There were $42.6 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, using proceeds from the SSLP Facility, SSLP returned capital totaling $28.9 million and $4.1
million to the Company and Voya, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company and Voya had contributed combined equity capital in the amount of $98.9 million and $92.2 million, respectively. Of the $98.9 million of
contributed equity capital at September 30, 2016, the Company contributed $29.9 million in the form of investments and $56.6 million in the form of cash and Voya contributed $12.4 million in the form of cash. As of September 30, 2016, the Company
and Voya s remaining commitments to SSLP totaled $88.5 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The Company, along with Voya, controls the funding of SSLP and SSLP may not call the unfunded commitments without approval of both the Company and
Voya.

   Stock Repurchase Program    
  On July 31, 2013, the Company s board of directors authorized a program for the purpose of repurchasing up to $100 million of the
Company s common stock. Under the repurchase program, the Company could have, but was not obligated to, repurchase its outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that the Company complied with the prohibitions under
its Insider Trading Policies and Procedures and the guidelines specified in Rules 10b-18 and 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. On December 5, 2013, the
Company s board of directors extended the repurchase program to be in place until the earlier of July 31, 2014 or until $100 million of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock had been repurchased. On July 31, 2014, the
Company s stock repurchase program expired. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repurchased 1,779,033 shares at an average price of approximately $21.97 per share, inclusive of commissions. The total dollar amount of shares
repurchased was $39.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company repurchased 796,418 shares at an average price of approximately $21.98 per share, inclusive of commissions, for a total dollar amount of $17.5 million.  
  On October 7, 2015, the Company announced a share repurchase program to purchase common stock in the open market in an amount up to $30
million. Under the repurchase program, the Company may, but is not obligated to, repurchase its outstanding common stock in the open market from time to time provided that the Company complies with the prohibitions under its Insider Trading Policies
and Procedures and the guidelines specified in Rules 10b-18 and 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including certain price, market volume and timing constraints. Unless amended or extended by the Company s board of
directors, the Company expects the repurchase program to be in place until the earlier of October 7, 2016 or until $30 million of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock have been repurchased. During the three months ended March 31,
2016, the Company repurchased 216,237 shares at an average price of $15.76 per share, inclusive of commissions. This represented a discount of approximately 25.2% from the net asset value per share at March 31, 2016. No shares were repurchased
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 or September 30, 2016. The total dollar amount of shares repurchased in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is $3.4 million, leaving a maximum of $26.6 million available for future program purchases.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company repurchased 400 shares at an average price of $15.98 per share, inclusive of commissions, for a total dollar amount of $6 thousand.      Critical Accounting Policies       The preparation of consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements, and revenues   
         44

and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies. Within the context
of these critical accounting policies and disclosed subsequent events herein, we are not currently aware of any other reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.   
    Valuation of Portfolio Investments        We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value is determined, at all times consistent with GAAP, and the 1940 Act. Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail
below:      Under procedures established by our board of directors (the  Board ), we value investments, including
certain senior secured debt, subordinated debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily available, at such market quotations (unless they are deemed not to represent fair value). We
attempt to obtain market quotations from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer or other independent pricing service). We utilize mid-market pricing as a practical expedient
for fair value unless a different point within the range is more representative. If and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, we typically utilize independent third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair
value. Accordingly, such investments go through our multi-step valuation process as described below. In each case, independent valuation firms consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their
valuation recommendations. Debt investments with maturities of 60 days or less shall each be valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which is expected to approximate fair value, unless such valuation, in the judgment of
the Investment Adviser, does not represent fair value, in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board. Investments that are not publicly traded or whose market
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board. Such determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates.   
  With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to
represent fair value, our Board has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:       

(1)  
  our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser
responsible for the portfolio investment;         

(2)  
  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of the Investment Adviser;     

(3)  
  independent valuation firms engaged by our Board conduct independent appraisals and review the Investment Adviser s preliminary valuations and make their own
independent assessment for all material assets;         

(4)  
  the audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuation of the Investment Adviser and that of the independent valuation firm and responds to the valuation
recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments; and         

(5)  
  the Board discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser, the
respective independent valuation firm and the audit committee.        Investments in all asset classes are valued
utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. However, in accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with ASC 946, may be valued using net asset value as
a practical expedient   
         45   

Table of Contents  

for fair value. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The
income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future
amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction
comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows,
the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. When
available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. Escrow receivables, if any, included in the receivables for investments sold in the Consolidated Statements of Assets
and Liabilities are reviewed quarterly and the value of the receivable is adjusted as necessary. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change to the Company s valuation techniques and the nature of the related inputs
considered in the valuation process.      Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820 classifies the inputs used
to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:       Level 1:  Quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities, accessible by the Company at the measurement date.       Level 2:  Quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.   
   Level 3:  Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.   
  In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on
the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.
The exercise of judgment is based in part on our knowledge of the asset class and our prior experience.      Determination of fair
value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated
financial statements.        Valuation of Senior Secured Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes     
  The Company has made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option of accounting to its Credit Facility and its Senior Secured
Notes, in accordance with ASC 825-10. We believe accounting for the Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes at fair value better aligns the measurement methodologies of assets and liabilities, which may mitigate certain earnings volatility.
       Revenue Recognition        The Company records dividend income and interest, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual basis. Investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest
and/or dividends in cash are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest/dividend cash payments are past due 30 days or more and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest/dividend cash payments will be
collected. Such non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest or   
         46   

Table of Contents  

dividends are paid in cash, and in management s judgment, are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining interest or dividend obligations. Interest or dividend cash payments
received on investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Some of our investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK interest and dividends computed at the contractual
rate are accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received,
they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, the Company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable (reflecting such amounts as the basis in
the additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at the maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be
placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends is reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. The Company does not
reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if the Company
again believes that PIK is expected to be realized. Loan origination fees, original issue discount, and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the interest method or straight-line, as applicable. Upon the prepayment of a
loan, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts. Capital structuring fees are recorded as other income when
earned.      The typically higher yields and interest rates on PIK securities, to the extent we invested, reflects the payment
deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans. PIK securities may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require
continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral. PIK interest has the effect of generating investment income and increasing the incentive fees payable at a compounding rate. In
addition, the deferral of PIK interest also increases the loan-to-value ratio at a compounding rate. PIK securities create the risk that incentive fees will be paid to the Investment Adviser based on non-cash accruals that ultimately may not be
realized, but the Investment Adviser will be under no obligation to reimburse the Company for these fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was no capitalized PIK income. For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, capitalized PIK income totaled $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively.        Net Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in
Unrealized Gain or Loss        We generally measure realized gain or loss by the difference between the net proceeds from the
repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized, but considering unamortized origination or commitment fees and prepayment penalties. The net change in
unrealized gain or loss reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when gains or losses are realized. Gains or losses on investments are
calculated by using the specific identification method.        Income Taxes     
  Solar Capital, a U.S. corporation, has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify for taxation as
a RIC, the Company is required, among other things, to timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a given tax
year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual
taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions, the Company accrues an estimated excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis. The update changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-02 for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU 2015-02 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-02 has not had a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.      In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
835-30) Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt
liability, consistent with debt discounts. Public companies are required to apply ASU 2015-03 retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU
2015-03 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-03 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.      In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). The update eliminates the requirement to categorize
investments in the fair value hierarchy if their fair value is measured at net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient in the FASB s fair value measurement guidance. Public companies are required to apply
ASU 2015-07 retrospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the impact of ASU 2015-07 on its consolidated financial statements and determined that the adoption of ASU
2015-07 has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
  Results comparisons are for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   
   Investment Income       For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, gross investment income totaled $39.8 million and $115.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, gross investment income totaled $30.4 million and
$84.1 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income for the year over year three and nine month periods was primarily due to growth of the income producing investment portfolio as well as fees received from the prepayment in June
2016 of loans to The Robbins Company, among others.       Expenses       Expenses totaled $22.8 million and $61.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, of which $11.6 million and $34.6 million, respectively, were base management fees
and performance-based incentive fees and $8.5 million and $19.1 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses (inclusive of $2.7 million of costs related to the amendment of the Credit Facility). Administrative services and
other general and administrative expenses totaled $2.7 million and $8.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net expenses totaled $13.5 million and $36.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, of which $7.5 million and $19.4 million, respectively, were base management fees and performance-based incentive fees and $3.9 million and $11.1 million, respectively, were interest and other credit facility expenses.
Administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled $2.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine   
         48

months ended September 30, 2015. Expenses generally consist of management and performance-based incentive fees, administrative services fees, insurance expenses, legal fees, directors  fees,
transfer agency fees, printing and proxy expenses, audit and tax services expenses, and other general and administrative expenses. Interest and other credit facility expenses generally consist of interest, unused fees, agency fees and loan
origination fees, if any, among others. The increase in expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was primarily due to higher management fees, performance-based
incentive fees and interest expense on a larger income producing investment portfolio.       Net Investment Income    
  The Company s net investment income totaled $17.0 million and $53.5 million, or $0.40 and $1.26, per average share, respectively, for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company s net investment income totaled $17.0 million and $47.4 million, or $0.40 and $1.12, per average share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
      Net Realized Gain (Loss)       The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling approximately $273 million and $365 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net realized gains over the
same periods were $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The Company had investment sales and prepayments totaling approximately $33 million and $117 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net realized
gains (losses) over the same periods were $0.1 million and ($6.5) million, respectively. Net realized gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were related to the sale of select assets. Net realized losses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 were primarily related to Quantum Foods, LLC.      Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss)    
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, net change in unrealized gain on the Company s assets and liabilities totaled
$7.8 million and $34.8 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, net change in unrealized gain (loss) on the Company s assets and liabilities totaled ($17.0) million and ($12.6) million, respectively. Net
unrealized gain for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to appreciation in the value of our investments in Global Tel*Link Corporation, Bishop Lifting Products, Inc., and Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program II LLC, among
others. Partially offsetting the net change in unrealized gain was depreciation on our investments in Breath Technologies, Inc. and Rug Doctor, among others. Net unrealized gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to
appreciation in the value of our investments in WireCo Worldgroup Inc., Crystal Financial, LLC, Global Tel*Link Corporation, Asurion, LLC, Rug Doctor, The Robbins Company and LegalZoom.com, Inc., among others. Partially offsetting the net change in
unrealized gain was depreciation on our investments in Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program LLC, Breathe Technologies, Inc. and Aegis Toxicology Sciences Corporation, among others. Net unrealized loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015
is primarily due to depreciation in the value of our investments in Crystal Financial LLC, WireCo Worldgroup Inc., Asurion, LLC and Bishop Lifting Products, Inc., among others. Net unrealized loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is
primarily due to depreciation in the value of our investments in WireCo Worldgroup Inc., Direct Buy Inc., Rug Doctor and Bishop Lifting Products, Inc., among others. Partially offsetting the net change in unrealized loss was a reversal of unrealized
depreciation on our investment in Quantum Foods, LLC.       Net Increase in Net Assets From Operations    
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $25.6
million and $89.0 million, respectively. For the same periods, earnings per average share were $0.61 and $2.11, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the   
         49   

Table of Contents  

Company had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $0.1 million and $28.3 million, respectively. For the same periods, earnings per average share were $0.00 and $0.67,
respectively.       LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       The Company s liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through its Credit Facility maturing in September 2021, through cash flows from operations, investment sales,
prepayments of senior and subordinated loans, income earned on investments and cash equivalents, and periodic follow-on equity and/or debt offerings. As of September 30, 2016, we had a total of $287.3 million of unused borrowing capacity under the
Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base limits.      We may from time to time issue equity and/or debt securities in either
public or private offerings. The issuance of such securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful. The primary uses of existing
funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for investments in portfolio companies, repayment of indebtedness, cash distributions to our shareholders, or for other general corporate purposes.   
  On January 11, 2013, the Company closed its most recent follow-on public equity offering of 6.3 million shares of common stock
at $24.40 per share raising approximately $146.9 million in net proceeds. The primary uses of the funds raised were for investments in portfolio companies, reductions in revolving debt outstanding and for other general corporate purposes.
     On November 16, 2012, we issued $100 million in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes for net proceeds of $96.9
million. Interest on the Unsecured Notes is paid quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, at a rate of 6.75% per year, commencing on February 15, 2013. The Unsecured Notes mature on November 15, 2042. The Company may redeem
the Unsecured Notes in whole or in part at any time or from time to time on or after November 15, 2017.      On May 10, 2012,
the Company closed a private offering of $75 million of Senior Secured Notes with a fixed interest rate of 5.875% and a maturity date of May 10, 2017. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is due semi-annually on May 10 and November 10. The
Senior Secured Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.      The primary uses of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness, investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our shareholders or for
other general corporate purposes.       Cash Equivalents       We deem certain U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities as cash equivalents. The Company makes purchases that are consistent with its purpose of
making investments in securities described in paragraphs 1 through 3 of Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. From time to time, including at or near the end of each fiscal quarter, we consider using various temporary investment strategies for our
business. One strategy includes taking proactive steps by utilizing cash equivalents as temporary assets with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility pursuant to Section 55 of the 1940 Act. More specifically, from time-to-time we
may purchase U.S. Treasury bills or other high-quality, short-term debt securities at or near the end of the quarter and typically close out the position on a net cash basis subsequent to quarter end. We may also utilize repurchase agreements or
other balance sheet transactions, including drawing down on our credit facilities, as deemed appropriate. The amount of these transactions or such drawn cash for this purpose is excluded from total assets for purposes of computing the asset base
upon which the management fee is determined. We held approximately $290 million in cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016.

    Debt        Unsecured Notes       On November 16, 2012, the Company and U.S. Bank
National Association entered into an Indenture and a First Supplemental Indenture relating to the Company s issuance, offer and sale of $100 million aggregate principal amount of its Unsecured Notes. The Unsecured Notes will mature on
November 15, 2042 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company s option at any time or from time to time on or after November 15, 2017 at a redemption price of $25 per security plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Unsecured
Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75% per year payable quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year. The Unsecured Notes are direct senior unsecured obligations of the Company.
      Revolving   Term Loan Facility       On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a second Credit Facility amendment. The Credit Facility is composed of $505 million of revolving credit and $50 million of term loans. Borrowings generally
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a range of 2.00-2.25% or the alternate base rate plus a range of 1.00%-1.25%. The Credit Facility has no LIBOR floor requirement. The Credit Facility matures in September 2021 and
includes ratable amortization in the final year. The Credit Facility may be increased up to $800 million with additional new lenders or an increase in commitments from current lenders. The Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and
negative covenants and events of default. In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants that among other things, requires the Company to maintain a minimum shareholder s equity and a minimum asset coverage ratio. The
Company also pays issuers of funded term loans quarterly in arrears a commitment fee at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily outstanding balance. In conjunction with the amendment of the Credit Facility, the Company expensed $2.7
million. At September 30, 2016, outstanding USD equivalent borrowings under the Credit Facility totaled $267.7 million.      Senior Secured
Notes       On May 10, 2012, the Company closed a private offering of $75 million of Senior Secured Notes with a fixed
interest rate of 5.875% and a maturity date of May 10, 2017. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is due semi-annually on May 10 and November 10. The Senior Secured Notes were issued in a private placement only to qualified
institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.      Certain covenants on our issued debt
may restrict our business activities, including limitations that could hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments or to make the distributions required to maintain our status as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. At September
30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial and operational covenants required by the Credit Facilities.        Contractual
Obligations        A summary of our significant contractual payment obligations is as follows as of September 30, 2016:
      Payments Due by Period (in millions)

   Information about our senior securities is shown in the following table (in thousands) as of
each year ended December 31 since the Company commenced operations, unless otherwise noted. The     indicates information which the SEC expressly does not require to be disclosed for certain types of senior securities.

(1)  
  Total amount of each class of senior securities outstanding at the end of the period presented.     

(2)  
  The asset coverage ratio for a class of senior securities representing indebtedness is calculated as our consolidated total assets, less all liabilities and
indebtedness not represented by senior securities, divided by all senior securities representing indebtedness. This asset coverage ratio is multiplied by one thousand to determine the Asset Coverage Per Unit. In order to determine the specific Asset
Coverage Per Unit for each class of debt, the total Asset Coverage Per Unit is allocated based on the amount outstanding in each class of debt at the end of the period. As of September 30, 2016, asset coverage was 307.3%.

   We have also entered into two contracts under which we have future commitments: the Advisory
Agreement, pursuant to which Solar Capital Partners, LLC has agreed to serve as our investment adviser, and the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which the Administrator has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services
necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations and provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. Payments under the Advisory Agreement are equal to (1) a percentage
of the value of our average gross assets and (2) a two-part incentive fee. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator s overhead in performing its
obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, technology systems, insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. Either party may
terminate each of the Advisory Agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon 60 days  written notice to the other. See note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.   
  On October 15, 2015, SSLP entered into an amended and restated servicing agreement with the Company. SSLP engaged and retained the
Company to provide certain administrative services relating to the facilities, supplies and necessary ongoing overhead support services for the operation of SSLP s ongoing business affairs in exchange for a fee. Either party may terminate this
agreement upon 30 days  written notice to the other.      On August 5, 2016, SSLP II entered into a servicing agreement with
the Company. SSLP II engaged and retained the Company to provide certain administrative services relating to the facilities, supplies and necessary ongoing overhead support services for the operation of SSLP II s ongoing business affairs in
exchange for a fee. Either party may terminate this agreement upon 30 days  written notice to the other.        Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements        The Company had unfunded debt and equity commitments to various revolving and delayed draw loans as well
as to Crystal Financial LLC. The total amount of these unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is $46.5 million and $65.8 million, respectively, comprised of the following:   

*  
  The Company controls the funding of the Crystal Financial LLC commitment and may cancel it at its discretion (also see Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program and Senior
Secured Unitranche Loan Program II sections in Item 7).        As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Company had sufficient cash available and/or liquid securities available to fund its commitments as well as the commitment to SSLP disclosed earlier.     In the normal course of its business, we invest or trade in various financial instruments and may enter into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk, which may include forward foreign
currency contracts. Generally, these financial instruments represent future commitments to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at future dates. These financial instruments contain varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk
whereby changes in the market value or our satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

Table of Contents  

     Distributions        The following table reflects the cash distributions per share on our common stock for the two most recent fiscal years and the current fiscal year to date:   
   
    Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of
the calendar year. Future quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board. We expect that our distributions to stockholders will generally be from accumulated net investment income, from net realized capital gains or non-taxable
return of capital, if any, as applicable.      We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain
our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In addition, although
we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ( i.e. , net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the
future decide to retain such capital gains for investment.      We maintain an  opt out  dividend reinvestment plan for
our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders  cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically  opt out  of the dividend
reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions.      We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to
make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company, we may in the future be limited in our ability
to make distributions. Also, our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare distributions if we default under certain provisions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax
consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such
as contractual payment-in-kind interest, which represents contractual interest added to   
         54

the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing
such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company.   
  With respect to the distributions to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing and certain other upfront fees
associated with investments in portfolio companies are treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders.       Related
Parties       We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the
following:       

We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with Solar Capital Partners. Mr. Gross, our chairman and chief executive officer, is a managing member
and a senior investment professional of, and has financial and controlling interests in, the Investment Adviser. In addition, Mr. Spohler, our chief operating officer is a partner and a senior investment professional of, and has financial
interests in, the Investment Adviser.          

The Administrator provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our
Administration Agreement. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with
performing compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief compliance officer, our chief financial officer and any administrative support staff.      

We have entered into a license agreement with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser has granted us a non-exclusive,
royalty-free license to use the name  Solar Capital.          The Investment Adviser and its affiliates
may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. For example, the Investment Adviser presently serves as investment adviser to Solar Senior Capital Ltd., a publicly traded
BDC, which focuses on investing primarily in senior secured loans, including first lien and second lien debt instruments. In addition, Michael S. Gross, our chairman and chief executive officer, Bruce Spohler, our chief operating officer, and
Richard L. Peteka, our chief financial officer, serve in similar capacities for Solar Senior Capital Ltd. The Investment Adviser and certain investment advisory affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of
those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, the Investment Adviser or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such
investments will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with the Investment Adviser s allocation procedures.   
  Related party transactions may occur between Solar Capital Ltd. and Crystal Financial LLC, between Solar Capital Ltd. and Senior Secured
Unitranche Loan Program LLC, between Solar Capital Ltd. and SSLP 2016-1, LLC and between Solar Capital Ltd. and Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program II LLC. These transactions may occur in the normal course of business. No administrative fees
are paid to Solar Capital Partners by Crystal Financial LLC, Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program LLC or Senior Secured Unitranche Loan Program II LLC.     In addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our officers and directors. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and
the Maryland General Corporation Law.

Item 3.   
   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk         We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, certain of the investments in our portfolio had floating interest rates.
These floating rate investments were primarily based on floating LIBOR and typically have durations of one to three months after which they reset to current market interest rates. Additionally, some of these investments have LIBOR floors. The
Company also has revolving credit facilities that are generally based on floating LIBOR. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and no new defaults by portfolio companies, a hypothetical one-quarter of one percent decrease
in LIBOR on our floating rate assets and liabilities would not change our net investment income per average share over the next twelve months. Assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and no new defaults by portfolio
companies, a hypothetical one percent increase in LIBOR on our floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our net investment income by approximately seven cents per average share over the next twelve months. However, we may hedge against
interest rate fluctuations from time-to-time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options, swaps and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in
interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in any benefits of certain changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments. At September 30, 2016, we have no interest rate hedging instruments outstanding.
      
    We may also have exposure to foreign currencies (e.g., Canadian Dollars) through various investments.
These investments are converted into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. In order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may borrow from time-to-time in such
currencies (e.g., Canadian Dollars) under our multi-currency revolving credit facility or enter into forward currency contracts.       

Item 4.   
   Controls and Procedures      
    (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     
  As of September 30, 2016 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures.        (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting     
  Management has not identified any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third
quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

      PART II. OTHER INFORMATION    

Item 1.   
   Legal Proceedings         We,
Solar Capital Management, LLC and Solar Capital Partners, LLC are not currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal
course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a
material effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations beyond what has been disclosed within these financial statements.

Exhibit 10.3        Execution Version        FORM OF AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO SENIOR SECURED CREDIT
AGREEMENT       AMENDMENT NO. 2 dated as of September 30, 2016 (this   Amendment No. 2  ) among SOLAR CAPITAL
LTD., a Maryland corporation (the   Borrower  ), the undersigned Lenders constituting the Required Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (the   Consenting Lenders  ) and CITIBANK, N.A., as administrative agent

1:00 p.m., London time, on any Business Day, in the case of Swingline Loans denominated in any Foreign Currency, require the Syndicated Lenders of the applicable Class to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the
Swingline Loans of such Class outstanding. Such notice to the Administrative Agent shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which the applicable Syndicated Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the
Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each applicable Syndicated Lender, specifying in such notice such Syndicated Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of such
  
         31   

Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Syndicated Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, within one (1) Business Day of receipt of notice as provided above in this paragraph, to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for account of such Swingline Lender, such Syndicated Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may be, of such Swingline Loan or Loans,  provided  that no Syndicated
Lender shall be required to purchase a participation in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) if (x) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Syndicated Borrowing at the time such
Swingline Loan was made and (y) the Required Lenders of the respective Class shall have so notified such Swingline Lender in writing and shall not have subsequently determined that the circumstances giving rise to such conditions not being
satisfied no longer exist.      Subject to the foregoing, each Syndicated Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph (c) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination
of the Commitments of the respective Class, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Syndicated Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Syndicated Loans made by such Syndicated Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply,  mutatis   mutandis , to the payment obligations of the
Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Syndicated Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan
acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the applicable Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by any Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or
other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the
Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Syndicated Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to such Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of
participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.      SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit.      (a)  General . Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for in Section 2.01, the Borrower may request the Issuing Bank to issue, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period and under either the Dollar Commitments or
Multicurrency Commitments, Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars or (in the case of Letters of Credit under the Multicurrency Commitments) in any Agreed Foreign Currency for its own account or the account of any of its Subsidiaries or any
Portfolio Company (provided that the Borrower shall remain primarily liable to the Issuing Bank and the Syndicated Lenders hereunder for payment and reimbursement of all amounts payable in respect of such Letter of Credit) in such form as is
acceptable to the Issuing Bank in its reasonable determination and for the benefit of such named beneficiary or beneficiaries as are specified by the Borrower. Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Dollar Commitments
or the Multicurrency Commitments, as applicable, up to the aggregate amount available to be drawn thereunder plus any L/C Disbursements then outstanding.      (b)  Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal or Extension . To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower
shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a
Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (d) of this Section), the amount and Currency of such Letter of Credit, whether such Letter of Credit is to be issued under the Dollar
Commitments or the Multicurrency Commitments, the name and   
         32   

address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also
shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and
conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall
control.      (c)  Limitations on Amounts . A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and
upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure of the
Issuing Bank (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Syndicated Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed $25,000,000, (ii) the total Revolving Dollar Credit
Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Dollar Commitments, (iii) the total Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments and (iv) the total Covered Debt Amount shall not exceed the
Borrowing Base then in effect.      (d)  Expiration Date . Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of
business on the earlier of (i) the date twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, twelve months after such renewal or extension, so long as such renewal or
extension occurs within three (3) months of such then-current expiration date) and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date;  provided ,  however , that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may,
upon the request of the Borrower, include a provision whereby such Letter of Credit shall be renewed automatically for additional consecutive periods of one (1) year or less (but not beyond the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the
Maturity Date) unless the Issuing Bank notifies the beneficiary thereof at least thirty (30) days prior to the then-applicable expiration date that such Letter of Credit will not be renewed;  provided further ,  however , that in no
event shall a Letter of Credit which expires after the Commitment Termination Date be renewed.      (e)  Participations . By
the issuance of a Letter of Credit of a Class (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by the Issuing Bank, and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Syndicated Lenders, the Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Syndicated Lender of such Class, and each Syndicated Lender of such Class hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Syndicated Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage or
Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may be, of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Syndicated Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this
paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or
reduction or termination of the applicable Commitments,  provided  that no Syndicated Lender shall be required to purchase a participation in a Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.05(e) if (x) the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02 would not be satisfied in respect of a Syndicated Borrowing at the time such Letter of Credit was issued and (y) the Required Lenders of the respective Class shall have so notified the Issuing Bank in writing and shall not
have subsequently determined that the circumstances giving rise to such conditions not being satisfied no longer exist.      In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Syndicated Lender of a Class hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the Issuing Bank, such Syndicated Lender s Applicable Dollar
Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may be, of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank in respect of Letters of Credit of such Class promptly within one (1) Business Day of the request of the Issuing Bank at any time
from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement,   
         33   

withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Syndicated Lender (and
Section 2.06 shall apply,  mutatis   mutandis , to the payment obligations of the Syndicated Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Syndicated Lenders.
Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to the next following paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the Syndicated
Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Syndicated Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Syndicated Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse
the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.      (f)  Reimbursement . If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to
the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m.,
New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time,  provided  that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, the
Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with a Syndicated ABR Borrowing or a Swingline Loan of the respective Class in an equivalent
amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Syndicated ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan.   
  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Syndicated Lender of the
applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Syndicated Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage, as the case may be, thereof.   
  (g)  Obligations Absolute . The Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this
Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability
of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower s obligations hereunder.   
  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or
responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any
error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;  provided  that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the
extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank s gross
negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that:   
  (i) the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice   
         34   

or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit;   
  (ii) the Issuing Bank shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such
payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and      (iii) this
sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the Issuing Bank when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing).      (h)  Disbursement
Procedures . The Issuing Bank shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;  provided  that any failure to give or delay in
giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.      (i)  Interim Interest . If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid
amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Syndicated ABR Loans;
 provided  that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within two (2) Business Days following the date when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then the provisions of Section 2.12(d) shall apply. Interest
accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Syndicated Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be
for account of such Syndicated Lender to the extent of such payment.      (j)  Replacement of the Issuing Bank . The Issuing
Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing
Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement,
(i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term  Issuing
Bank  shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of the Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank
shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional
Letters of Credit.      (k)  Cash Collateralization . If the Borrower shall be required to provide cover for LC Exposure
pursuant to Section 2.09(a), Section 2.10(b), Section 2.10(c) or the last paragraph of Article VII, the Borrower shall immediately deposit into a segregated collateral account or accounts (herein, collectively, the
  Letter of Credit Collateral Account  ) in the name and under the dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, Cash denominated in the Currency of the Letter of Credit under which such LC Exposure arises in an amount equal to
the amount required under Section 2.09(a), 2.10(b) and Section 2.10(c) or the last paragraph of Article VII, as applicable. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral in the first instance for the LC Exposure
under this Agreement and thereafter for the payment of the  Secured Obligations  under and as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement, and for these purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest
  
         35   

to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property
held therein.      SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings.      (a)  Funding by Lenders . Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 4:00 p.m., Local Time (1:00 p.m.
Local Time for Eurocurrency Borrowings) to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders;  provided  that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in
Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing
Request;  provided  that Syndicated ABR Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(f) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank;  provided   further 
that, Syndicated ABR Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of a Swingline Loan as provided in Section 2.04(c) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Swingline Lender.   
  (b)  Presumption by the Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to
the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR
Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Nothing in this Section 2.06(b) shall relieve any Lender of its obligation to fulfill its
commitments hereunder, and shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.   
  SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections.      (a)  Elections by the Borrower for Syndicated Borrowings and Term Borrowings . Subject to Section 2.03(d), the Loans constituting each Syndicated Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall be
of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing
of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section;  provided ,  however , that (i) a
Syndicated Borrowing of a Class may only be continued or converted into a Syndicated Borrowing of the same Class, (ii) a Syndicated Borrowing denominated in one Currency may not be continued as, or converted to, a Syndicated Borrowing in a
different Currency, (iii) no Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may be continued if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures would exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments,
and (iv) a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may not be converted to a Borrowing of a different Type. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case
each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders of the respective Class holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply
to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.      (b)  Notice of Elections . To make an election
pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required   
         36   

under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Syndicated Borrowing or Term Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each
such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly (but no later than the close of business on the date of such request) by hand delivery, telecopy or electronic mail to the Administrative Agent of a
written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.      (c)  Content
of Interest Election Requests . Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:   
  (i) the Borrowing (including the Class) to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are
being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be
specified for each resulting Borrowing);      (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;      (iii) whether, in the case of a Borrowing
denominated in Dollars, the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and   
  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such
election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term  Interest Period  and permitted under Section 2.02(d).      (d)  Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders . Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details
thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing.      (e)  Failure to Elect; Events of Default . If the
Borrower fails to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, (i) if such Borrowing
is denominated in Dollars, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a Syndicated Eurocurrency Borrowing of the same Class or a Term Borrowing, as the case may be, having an Interest Period of one (1) month, and
(ii) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one (1) month s duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing, no outstanding Eurocurrency Borrowing may have an Interest Period of more than one
(1) month s duration.      SECTION 2.08. Termination, Reduction or Increase of the Commitments.   
  (a)  Scheduled Termination . Unless previously terminated (including as set forth in Section 2.08(f) below), the Commitments of each
Class shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date.      (b)  Voluntary Termination or Reduction . The Borrower may at
any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of any Class;  provided  that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of a Class shall be in an amount that is $3,000,000 (or, if less, the entire remaining amount of the
Commitments of any Class) or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Dollar Commitments or the Multicurrency Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of
the Syndicated Loans of such Class in accordance with Section 2.10, the total Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class would exceed the total Commitments of such Class.      (c)  Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction . The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section
at least three (3)   
         37   

Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative
Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;  provided  that a notice of termination of the Commitments of a Class delivered by the
Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if
such condition is not satisfied.      (d)  Effect of Termination or Reduction . Any termination or reduction of the
Commitments of a Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of a Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders of such Class in accordance with their respective Commitments.   
  (e)  Increase of the Commitments .      (i)  Requests for Increase by Borrower . The Borrower may, at any time, propose that the Commitments hereunder be increased (each such proposed increase being a   Commitment
Increase  ) by notice to the Administrative Agent, specifying each existing Lender (each an   Increasing Lender  ) and/or each additional lender (each an   Assuming Lender  ) that shall have agreed to an
additional Commitment and the date on which such increase is to be effective (the   Commitment Increase Date  ), which shall be a Business Day at least three (3) Business Days after delivery of such notice and at least thirty
(30) days prior to the Commitment Termination Date;  provided  that:      (A) the minimum amount of the
Commitment of any Assuming Lender, and the minimum amount of the increase of the Commitment of any Increasing Lender, as part of such Commitment Increase shall be $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or any other minimum
amount as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent);      (B) immediately after giving effect to such
Commitment Increase, the sum of total Commitments of all of the Lenders hereunder  plus  the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Term Loans shall not exceed $800,000,000;   
  (C) no Non-Extending Lender may participate in any Commitment Increase unless in connection therewith, it shall have
agreed to become an  Extending Lender  hereunder;      (D) each Assuming Lender shall be consented to by
the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);  provided   however , the consent of the Issuing Bank shall not be required in connection with an increase of the Term
Commitment;      (E) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such Commitment Increase Date or shall
result from the proposed Commitment Increase; and      (F) the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Commitment Increase Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of
such specific date).      For the avoidance of doubt, no Lender shall be obligated to agree to an additional Commitment requested
by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08(e).      (ii)  Effectiveness of Commitment Increase by
Borrower . Each Assuming Lender, if any, shall become a Lender hereunder as of such Commitment Increase Date and the Commitment of the respective Class of any Increasing Lender and such Assuming Lender shall be increased as of such Commitment
Increase Date;  provided  that:      (A) the Administrative Agent shall have received on or prior to 12:00
noon, New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date (or on or prior to a time on an earlier date specified by the   
         38   

Administrative Agent) a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Borrower stating that each of the applicable conditions to such Commitment Increase set forth in the foregoing paragraph
(i) has been satisfied; and      (B) each Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender shall have delivered to the
Administrative Agent, on or prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date (or on or prior to a time on an earlier date specified by the Administrative Agent), an agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which such Lender shall, effective as of such Commitment Increase Date, undertake a Commitment or an increase of Commitment in each case of the respective Class, duly executed by such Assuming
Lender or Increasing Lender, as applicable, and the Borrower and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent.      Promptly following
satisfaction of such conditions, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of such Class (including any Assuming Lenders) thereof and of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase Date by facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system.
     (iii)  Recordation into Register . Upon its receipt of an agreement referred to in clause (ii)(B)
above executed by an Assuming Lender or any Increasing Lender as applicable, together with the certificate referred to in clause (ii)(A) above, the Administrative Agent shall, if such agreement has been completed, (x) accept such
agreement, (y) record the information contained therein in the Register and (z) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.      (iv)  Adjustments of Borrowings upon Effectiveness of Increase . On the Commitment Increase Date, the Borrower shall (A) prepay the outstanding Loans (if any) of the affected Class in full,
(B) simultaneously borrow new Loans of such Class hereunder in an amount equal to such prepayment (in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, with LIBO Rates equal to the outstanding LIBO Rate and with Interest Period(s) ending on the date(s) of any
then outstanding Interest Period(s) provided that for any outstanding Interest Period of less than one (1) month, the LIBO Rate will be equal to one (1) month LIBOR), as applicable (as modified hereby);  provided  that with respect to
subclauses (A) and (B), (x) the prepayment to, and borrowing from, any existing Lender shall be effected by book entry to the extent that any portion of the amount prepaid to such Lender will be subsequently borrowed from such Lender and
(y) the existing Lenders, the Increasing Lenders and the Assuming Lenders shall make and receive payments among themselves, in a manner acceptable to the Administrative Agent, so that, after giving effect thereto, the Loans of such Class are
held ratably by the Lenders of such Class in accordance with the respective Commitments of such Class of such Lenders (after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) and (C) pay to the Lenders of such Class the amounts, if any, payable under
Section 2.15 as a result of any such prepayment. Concurrently therewith, the Lenders of such Class shall be deemed to have adjusted their participation interests in any outstanding Letters of Credit of such Class so that such interests are held
ratably in accordance with their Commitments of such Class.      (f)  Mandatory Termination of Commitments of Non-Extending
Lenders . Unless previously terminated, the Commitments of each Non-Extending Lender shall terminate on the Existing Commitment Termination Date and, in connection therewith, each Extending Lender hereby agrees that it shall not be entitled to
any pro-rata reduction in its Commitments of the same Class notwithstanding Section 2.17(c) or any other provision hereof to the contrary.     SECTION 2.09. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.      (a)  Repayment . The
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay the Loans of each Class as follows:      (i) to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Syndicated Lenders of such Class, on the dates set forth on Schedule 2.09, or if any such date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day, a principal amount of the Syndicated Loans of such Class equal to
the percentage of Syndicated Loans of such Class outstanding on the Commitment Termination Date (in the case of the Extending Lenders) or Existing Commitment Termination Date (in the case of the Non-Extending Lenders) as set forth on Schedule 2.09
for   
         39   

such date, together in each case with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount repaid. To the extent not previously paid (including as set forth in Section 2.10(g)), all Loans shall be
due and payable on the Maturity Date;      (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Term Lenders, on
the Maturity Date, or if such date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day, the unpaid principal amount of all Term Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount repaid;   
  (iii) to each Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan of such Class denominated in
Dollars made by such Swingline Lender, on the earlier of the Commitment Termination Date (in the case of a Swingline Lender that is an Extending Lender) or the Existing Commitment Termination Date (in the case of a Swingline Lender that is a
Non-Extending Lender) and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the fifteenth or last day of a calendar month and is at least ten (10) Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made;  provided  that on each date that a
Syndicated Borrowing of such Class is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans of such Class then outstanding; and      (iv) to each Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan of such Class denominated in a Foreign Currency made by such Swingline Lender, on the earlier of the Commitment
Termination Date (in the case of a Swingline Lender that is an Extending Lender) or the Existing Commitment Termination Date (in the case of a Swingline Lender that is a Non-Extending Lender) and the fifth Business Day after such Swingline Loan is
made.      In addition, on the Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower shall deposit into the Letter of Credit Collateral
Account Cash in an amount equal to 102% of the undrawn face amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding on the close of business on the Commitment Termination Date, such deposit to be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral security for the
LC Exposure under this Agreement in respect of the undrawn portion of such Letters of Credit.      (b)  Manner of Payment .
Subject to Section 2.09(a)(i), prior to any repayment or prepayment of any Borrowings of any Class hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings of such Class to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy or electronic mail) of such selection not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three (3) Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment;  provided  that each repayment of Borrowings of a Class shall be
applied to repay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Class before any other Borrowings of such Class. If the Borrower fails to make a timely selection of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be applied,
 first , to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of the applicable Class and,  second , to other Borrowings of such Class in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining
Interest Period to be repaid first). Each payment of a Syndicated Borrowing or a Term Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in such Borrowing.      (c)  Maintenance of Records by Lenders . Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan
made by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.      (d)  Maintenance of Records by the Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the
Class and Type thereof and each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount and Currency of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender of such Class hereunder and (iii) the amount
and Currency of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof.      (e)  Effect of Entries . The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be  prima   facie  evidence, absent obvious error, of
the existence and amounts of the obligations   
         40   

recorded therein;  provided  that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.      (f)  Promissory Notes . Any Lender may
request that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and
its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by
one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).      SECTION 2.10. Prepayment of Loans.      (a)  Optional Prepayments . The Borrower
shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part without any penalty or premium (other than amounts payable under Section 2.15, if any), subject to the requirements of this Section;  provided 
 that , the Borrower shall not be permitted to prepay any Term Borrowing in whole or in part prior to the Commitment Termination Date unless an equivalent ratable amount of Multicurrency Commitments and Dollar Commitments are terminated in
accordance with Section 2.08(b) in connection with such prepayment.      (b)  Mandatory Prepayments due to Changes in Exchange
Rates .      (i)  Determination of Amount Outstanding . On each Quarterly Date and, in addition, promptly
upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Currency Valuation Notice (as defined below), the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure. For the purpose of this determination, the outstanding
principal amount of any Loan that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Foreign Currency of such Loan, determined as of such Quarterly Date or, in the case of a Currency Valuation
Notice received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time on a Business Day, as of such Business Day or, in the case of a Currency Valuation Notice otherwise received, as of the first Business Day after such Currency
Valuation Notice is received. Upon making such determination, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Multicurrency Lenders and the Borrower thereof.      (ii)  Prepayment . If, on the date of such determination the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure exceeds 105% of the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Commitments as then in effect,
the Borrower shall, if requested by the Required Multicurrency Lenders (through the Administrative Agent), prepay the Syndicated Multicurrency Loans and Swingline Multicurrency Loans (and/or provide cover for Multicurrency LC Exposure as specified
in Section 2.05(k)) within fifteen (15) Business Days following the Borrower s receipt of such request in such amounts as shall be necessary so that after giving effect thereto, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure does
not exceed the Multicurrency Commitments.      For purposes hereof,   Currency Valuation Notice   means a notice given by the
Required Multicurrency Lenders to the Administrative Agent stating that such notice is a  Currency Valuation Notice  and requesting that the Administrative Agent determine the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure. The
Administrative Agent shall not be required to make more than one (1) valuation determination pursuant to Currency Valuation Notices within any rolling three-month period.      Any prepayment required pursuant to this paragraph shall be applied,  first , to Swingline Multicurrency Loans outstanding,  second , to Syndicated Multicurrency Loans outstanding and
 third , as cover for Multicurrency LC Exposure.      (c)  Mandatory Prepayments due to Borrowing Base Deficiency . In
the event that at any time any Borrowing Base Deficiency shall exist, the Borrower shall prepay the Syndicated Loans and/or the Term Loans (subject to   
         41   

Section 2.10(e)(ii), at the option of the Borrower) (or provide cover for Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(k)) or reduce Other Covered Indebtedness (among such components
thereof determined by the Borrower) in such amounts as shall be necessary so that such Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured within five (5) Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such Borrowing Base Deficiency
(and/or at such other times as the Borrower has knowledge of such Borrowing Base Deficiency);  provided  that (i) the aggregate amount of such prepayment of Loans (and cover for Letters of Credit) shall be at least equal to the Revolving
Credit Exposure s and Term Loans  ratable share of the aggregate prepayment and reduction of Other Covered Indebtedness and (ii) if, within five (5) Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate demonstrating such
Borrowing Base Deficiency (and/or at such other times as the Borrower has knowledge of such Borrowing Base Deficiency), the Borrower shall present to the Administrative Agent a reasonably feasible plan to enable such Borrowing Base Deficiency to be
cured within thirty (30) Business Days (which (30)-Business Day period shall include the five (5) Business Days permitted for delivery of such plan), then such prepayment or reduction shall not be required to be effected within such five (5)
Business Day period so long as the Borrower shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to effectuate such prepayment or reduction but may be effected in accordance with such plan (with such modifications as the Borrower may reasonably determine),
so long as such Borrowing Base Deficiency is cured within such 30-Business Day period.      (d)  Mandatory Prepayments due to
Non-Approved Change in Investment Policies . In the event that at any time the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall amend, change, supplement or otherwise modify the Investment Policies in any manner that is, or that could reasonably be
expected to be, materially adverse to the Lenders in any respect (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without the Borrower or such Subsidiary having obtained the consent referred to in clause (b) of the proviso to the definition of Investment
Policies), the Borrower shall, if requested by the Required Lenders (through the Administrative Agent), prepay the Loans then outstanding in full, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued
hereunder;  provided  that, no prepayment shall be required to the extent such amendment, change, supplement or modification is mandated by applicable law, rule or regulation (including the provisions of the Investment Company Act
applicable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries).      (e)  Prepayment Allocations . Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in Section 2.09 or this Section 2.10:      (i) following the Commitment Termination Date, no optional
prepayment of the Loans of any Class shall be permitted unless at such time, the Borrower also prepays the Loans of each other Class (unless such prepayment is waived by the Required Lenders of such Class), which prepayment shall be made on a pro
rata basis between each outstanding Class; and      (ii) any prepayment of Loans required to be made pursuant
to clause (c) above shall be applied to prepay Syndicated Loans and/or Term Loans, as applicable, on a  pro rata  basis in accordance with each Lender s pro rata share of the Revolving Credit Exposure and Term Loans as of such date.
     (f)  Notices, Etc . The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline
Loan, the applicable Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy or electronic mail) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time (or, in the case
of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency, 12:00 noon, London time), three (3) Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of
prepayment, (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan denominated in Dollars, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment or (iv) in the case of a prepayment of a Swingline Loan denominated in a
Foreign Currency, not later than 1:00 p.m., London time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case
of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment;  provided  that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments of a Class as
contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if   
         42   

such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Syndicated Borrowing or a Term Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the affected Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02,
except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be applied ratably to the Loans of such Class included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be
accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and shall be made in the manner specified in Section 2.09(b).      (g)  Special Mandatory Repayment/Prepayment to Non-Extending Lenders.  On the Existing Maturity Date (or, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, on such earlier
date on or after the Amendment Effective Date as the Borrower may elect by written notice in accordance with Section 2.10(f)), the Borrower shall repay or prepay (as the case may be) all of the Loans of the Non-Extending Lenders and, in connection
therewith, each Extending Lender hereby agrees that, so long as its Loans are not otherwise due and payable hereunder, it shall not be entitled to any pro-rata repayment of its Loans of the same Class notwithstanding Section 2.17(c) or any other
provision hereof to the contrary. If any LC Exposure exists at the time of such repayment or prepayment to the Non-Extending Lenders:      (i) all of such LC Exposure held by the Non-Extending Lenders shall be reallocated among the remaining Multicurrency Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Multicurrency Percentages but
only to the extent (x) the sum of all Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures does not exceed the total of all Extending Lenders  Multicurrency Commitments, (y) no Extending Lender s Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure will exceed
such Lender s Multicurrency Commitment, and (z) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time; and      (ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall on the day of such prepayment to the Non-Extending Lenders also prepay Loans in
accordance with Section 2.10(a) in an amount such that after giving effect thereto, all LC Exposure of the Non-Extending Lenders could be reallocated in accordance with clause (i) above (whereupon such LC Exposure shall be so reallocated regardless
of whether the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time).      Upon termination of the Non-Extending Lenders 
Commitments pursuant to Section 2.08(f) and the reallocation of the Non-Extending Lenders  LC Exposure and repayment of each Non-Extending Lender s Loans and all other amounts then due and payable to the Non-Extending Lenders in accordance
with this clause (g), the Non-Extending Lenders shall cease being party to this Agreement but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to such date.
     SECTION 2.11. Fees.      (a)  Commitment Fee . The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Syndicated Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.375% per annum on the average
daily unused amount of the Dollar Commitment and Multicurrency Commitment, as applicable, of such Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the earlier of the date such Commitment terminates and the Commitment
Termination Date. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable within one (1) Business Day after each Quarterly Date and on the earlier of the date the Commitments of the respective Class terminate and the Commitment Termination Date, commencing on the
first such date to occur after the Effective Date. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
day). For purposes of computing commitment fees, the Dollar Commitment or Multicurrency Commitments, as applicable, of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Syndicated Loans, LC Exposure and Swingline Exposure of
such Class of such Lender.   
         43   

(b)  Letter of Credit Fees . The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative
Agent for account of each Syndicated Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit of each Class, which shall accrue at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin applicable to Eurocurrency Loans on the
average daily amount of such Syndicated Lender s LC Exposure of such Class (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the
date on which such Syndicated Lender s Commitment of such Class terminates and the date on which such Syndicated Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure of such Class, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the
rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of
termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank s standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings
thereunder;  provided   that , no fees will accrue under this Section 2.11(b) on any Defaulting Lender s portion of a Letter of Credit that the Borrower has Cash Collateralized the obligations thereunder pursuant to Section
2.19(a). Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including each Quarterly Date shall be payable on the third Business Day following such Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
 provided  that all such fees with respect to the Letters of Credit of a Class shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments of such Class terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which such Commitments terminate shall be
payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within ten (10) days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).      (c)
 Administrative Agent Fees . The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.   
  (d)  Payment of Fees . (i) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and immediately available
funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of Commitment fees and participation fees, to the Syndicated Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable
under any circumstances absent obvious error.      (ii) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during
such period as a Syndicated Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender will not be entitled to any fees accruing during such period pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) or (b) (without prejudice to the rights of the Non-Defaulting Lenders in
respect of such fees);  provided   that  (A) to the extent that all or any portion of the LC Exposure or the Swingline Exposure of such Defaulting Lender is reallocated to the Non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.19(b), such fees
that would have accrued for the benefit of such Defaulting Lender will instead accrue for the benefit of and be payable to such Non-Defaulting Lenders,  pro rata  in accordance with their respective Dollar Commitments and Multicurrency
Commitments, as applicable, and (B) to the extent all or any portion of such LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure cannot be so reallocated, such fees will instead accrue for the benefit of and be payable to the Issuing Bank and the applicable Swingline
Lender, as applicable (and the  pro rata  payment provisions of Section 2.17(c) will automatically be deemed adjusted to reflect the provisions of this Section).      SECTION 2.12. Interest.      (a)  ABR Loans . The Loans constituting each ABR
Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan denominated in Dollars) shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate  plus  the Applicable Margin.      (b)  Eurocurrency Loans . The Loans constituting each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the related Interest Period for such Borrowing
 plus  the Applicable Margin.   
         44   

(c)  Foreign Currency Swingline Loans . Swingline Loans denominated in Foreign
Currencies shall bear interest at a rate per annum agreed between the Borrower and the applicable Swingline Lender at the time the respective Swingline Loans are made;  provided  that if any such Loan shall continue outstanding for more than
five (5) Business Days, such Loan shall be deemed automatically converted into a Eurocurrency Loan held solely by such Swingline Lender with consecutive Interest Periods of one-month s duration.   
  (d)  Default Interest . Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount
payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to
(i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2%  plus  the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2%  plus  the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph
(a) of this Section.      (e)  Payment of Interest . Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan in the Currency in which such Loan is denominated and, in the case of Syndicated Loans and Term Loans, upon the Maturity Date;  provided  that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of a Syndicated ABR Loan prior to the Commitment Termination Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such
Borrowing shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.      (f)  Computation . All interest hereunder shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or
366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      SECTION 2.13.  Alternate Rate of
Interest . If prior to the commencement of the Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing of a Class (the Currency of such Borrowing herein called the   Affected Currency  ):   
  (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Affected Currency for such Interest Period; or      (b) the
Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders of such Class that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Affected Currency for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their
respective Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;      then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower
and the affected Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and such Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any
Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Syndicated Borrowing or Term Borrowing to, or the continuation of any Syndicated Borrowing or Term Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in the Affected Currency shall be
ineffective and, if the Affected Currency is Dollars, such Syndicated Borrowing or Term Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be continued as, or converted to, a Syndicated ABR Borrowing or Term ABR Borrowing, as applicable, (ii) if the Affected
Currency is Dollars and any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as a Syndicated ABR Borrowing or a Term ABR Borrowing, as applicable, and (iii) if the Affected Currency is a
Foreign Currency, any Borrowing Request that requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in the Affected Currency shall be ineffective.   
         45   

SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs.   
  (a)  Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall:   
  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank;   
  (ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d)
of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or   
  (iii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other
than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;      and the result of any of
the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, such
Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as
the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.   
  (b)  Capital Requirements . If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or Issuing Bank or
any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or Issuing
Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline
Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lender s or Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity) by an amount deemed to be material by such
Lender or such Issuing Bank, then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender s or
Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered.      (c)  Certificates from Lenders . A certificate of a
Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts in Dollars necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be promptly delivered to
the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within then (10) days after receipt thereof.   
  (d)  Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation;  provided  that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased
costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six (6) months prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such
Lender s or Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof).   
         46   

SECTION 2.15.  Break Funding Payments . In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor,
(c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Syndicated Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(e) and
is revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18(b) of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the
Borrower shall compensate each affected Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding in any event, loss of anticipated profits). In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such
event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of      (i)
the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan denominated in the Currency of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of
the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable
on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Currency for such Interest Period,  over    
  (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to
invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits denominated in such Currency from other banks in the eurocurrency market at the commencement of such
period.      Payment under this Section shall be made upon request of a Lender delivered not later than five (5) Business Days following the
payment, conversion, or failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay that gives rise to a claim under this Section accompanied by a certificate of such Lender setting forth the amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to
this Section, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.   
  SECTION 2.16. Taxes.      (a)  Issuing Bank . For purposes of this Section 2.16, the term  Lender  includes the Issuing Bank.      (b)  Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Obligor under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as
required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable
Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then
the sum payable by the Obligor shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.      (c)  Payment of
Other Taxes . The Obligors shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.   
  (d)  Indemnification by the Obligors . The Obligors shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days
after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such
  
         47   

Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative
Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.      (e)  Indemnification by the
Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Obligor has not already indemnified
the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Obligors to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04 relating to the maintenance of
a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender
from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).      (f)  Evidence of
Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Obligor to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.16, such Obligor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.   
  (g)  Status of Lenders . (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to
payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section
2.16(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially
prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.      (ii) Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,      (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed
copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;      (B) any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes
a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:   
  (I) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party
(x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document,   
         48   

executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  interest  article
of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the  business profits  or
 other income  article of such tax treaty;      (II) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;   
  (III) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c)
of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a  10 percent shareholder  of the Borrower
within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a  controlled foreign corporation  described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a  U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate ) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS
Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or      (IV) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed
copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2 or Exhibit D-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each
beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;      (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or
prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by
applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and      (D) if a payment made to a Lender
under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code,
as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by
applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to
comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D),
 FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.      Each Lender agrees that if any
form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do
so.      (h)  Treatment of Certain Refunds . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it
has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.16 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an
  
         49   

amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses
(including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay
to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to
such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would
place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be
construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.   
  (i)  Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the
Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.   
  SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set offs.   
  (a)  Payments by the Borrower . The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal,
interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in
immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments to be made directly to the
Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such
payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.      All amounts owing under this Agreement (including commitment fees, payments required under Section 2.14, and payments required under Section 2.15 relating to any Loan denominated in Dollars, but
not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.15 or any reimbursement or Cash Collateralization of any LC Exposure denominated in any
Foreign Currency, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal
of any Loan when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan shall, if such Loan is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date
thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall
be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than
the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand.   
         50   

(b)  Application of Insufficient Payments . If at any time insufficient funds are
received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)  first , to pay interest and fees
of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees of such Class then due to such parties, and (ii)  second , to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements
of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due to such parties.   
  (c)  Pro Rata Treatment . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be
made from the Lenders of such Class, each payment of commitment fee under Section 2.11 shall be made for account of the Lenders of the applicable Class, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under
Section 2.08 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class,  pro rata  according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) each Syndicated Borrowing of a Class shall be allocated
 pro rata  among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of Syndicated Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing
(in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Syndicated Lenders of such Class  pro rata  in
accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Syndicated Loans of such Class held by them; (iv) each payment of interest on Syndicated Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Syndicated Lenders of such
Class  pro rata  in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Syndicated Loans of such Class then due and payable to the respective Lenders; (v) each payment or prepayment of principal of Term Loans by the Borrower shall be made for the
account of the Term Lenders  pro rata  in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amount of the Term Loans held by them; and (vi) each payment of interest on Term Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account if the Term Lenders
 pro rata  in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Term Loans then due and payable to the Term Lenders.      (d)
 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Syndicated Loans, Term Loans, or participations in
LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Syndicated Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, and accrued interest
thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Syndicated Loans, Term Loans and participations in LC Disbursements
and Swingline Loans, of other Lenders, as applicable, to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their
respective Syndicated Loans, Term Loans, and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;  provided  that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other
than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the
amount of such participation.      (e)  Presumptions of Payment . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
  
         51   

assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed
to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.   
  (f)  Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it
pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of
such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.      SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.      (a)  Designation
of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates,
if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any cost or
expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment.      (b)  Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender (as
provided in Section 9.02(e)), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
 provided  that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Dollar Commitment or Multicurrency Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lenders), which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued
fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any
such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.   
  SECTION 2.19. Defaulting Lender Provisions      (a)  Cash Collateral Call . If any Syndicated Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, if any Letter of Credit or Swingline Loan is at the time outstanding, the Issuing
Bank and the Swingline Lenders, as the case may be, may (except, in the case of a Defaulting Lender, to the extent the Commitments have been fully reallocated pursuant to Section 2.19(b)), by notice to the Borrower and such Defaulting Lender through
the Administrative Agent, require the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the obligations of the Borrower to   
         52   

the Issuing Bank and such Swingline Lender, as the case may be, in respect of such Letter of Credit or Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the unreallocated obligations
(contingent or otherwise) of such Defaulting Lender to be applied  pro rata  in respect thereof, or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and to the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lenders, as the case may be, in
their sole discretion to protect them against the risk of non-payment by such Defaulting Lender.      (b)  Reallocation of
Defaulting Lender Commitment, Etc . If a Syndicated Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, the following provisions shall apply with respect to any outstanding LC Exposure and any outstanding Swingline Exposure of
such Defaulting Lender:      (i) the LC Exposure and the Swingline Exposure of such Defaulting Lender will, subject
to the limitation in the first proviso below, automatically be reallocated (effective on the day such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender) among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in the applicable Class  pro rata  in accordance with their respective
Commitments of such Class;  provided   that  (A) the sum of each Non-Defaulting Lender s total Revolving Credit Exposure, total Swingline Exposure and total LC Exposure of such Class may not in any event exceed the Commitment of such
Class of such Non-Defaulting Lender as in effect at the time of such reallocation and (B) neither such reallocation nor any payment by a Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant thereto will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lenders or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender;   
  (ii) to the extent that any portion (the  unreallocated portion ) of the Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure
and Swingline Exposure cannot be so reallocated, whether by reason of the first proviso in clause (i) above or otherwise, the Borrower will, not later than five (5) Business Days after demand by the Administrative Agent (at the direction of the
Issuing Bank and/or the applicable Swingline Lender, as the case may be), (A) Cash Collateralize the obligations of the Borrower to the Issuing Bank and such Swingline Lender in respect of such LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, as the case may be,
in an amount at least equal to the aggregate amount of the unreallocated portion of such LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, or (B) in the case of such Swingline Exposure, prepay (subject to clause (iii) below) and/or Cash Collateralize in full the
unreallocated portion thereof, or (C) make other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and to the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lenders, as the case may be, in their sole discretion to protect them against the risk of non-payment
by such Defaulting Lender; and      (iii) any amount paid by the Borrower or otherwise received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of a Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity payments or other amounts) will not be paid or distributed to such Defaulting Lender, but will instead be
retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated non-interest bearing account until (subject to Section 2.19(e)) the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all obligations of the Borrower hereunder and will be applied by the
Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the making of payments from time to time in the following order of priority:  first  to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent
under this Agreement,  second  to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lenders ( pro rata  as to the respective amounts owing to each of them) under this Agreement,  third  to
the payment of post-default interest and then current interest due and payable to the Lenders hereunder other than Defaulting Lenders, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such interest then due and payable to them,  fourth  to
the payment of fees then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders hereunder, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such fees then due and payable to them,  fifth  to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due
and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders hereunder ratably in accordance with the amounts thereof then due and payable to them,  sixth  to the ratable payment of other amounts then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders, and
 seventh  after the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all obligations of the Borrower hereunder, to pay amounts owing under this Agreement to such Defaulting Lender or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise
direct.   
         53   

(c)  Drawdown Notices . In furtherance of the foregoing, if any Syndicated Lender
becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, each of the Issuing Bank and each Swingline Lender is hereby authorized by the Borrower (which authorization is irrevocable and coupled with an interest) to give, in its discretion,
through the Administrative Agent, Notices of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03 in such amounts and at such times as may be required to (i) reimburse an outstanding LC Disbursement, (ii) repay an outstanding Swingline Loan, and/or (iii) Cash
Collateralize the obligations of the Borrower in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the obligations (contingent or otherwise) of such Defaulting Lender in respect of such Letter

amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender upon not less than five (5) Business Days  prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which will promptly notify the Lenders thereof), and in such event the provisions of Section 2.19(b)(iii) will
apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts),  provided  that such termination will not be

adjustments as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Credit Exposure, LC Exposure and Swingline Exposure of the Lenders to be on a  pro rata  basis in accordance with their respective Commitments,
whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender and will be a Non-Defaulting Lender (and such Exposure of each Lender will automatically be adjusted on a prospective basis to reflect the foregoing);  provided   that  no
adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and  provided ,  further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed

Non-Defaulting Lender s total Revolving Credit Exposure, total Swingline Exposure and total LC Exposure may not in any event exceed the Commitment of such Non-Defaulting Lender, and (ii) neither any such reallocation nor any payment by a
Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant thereto nor any such Cash Collateralization or reduction will constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lenders or any other Lender may have
against such Defaulting Lender, or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender.       ARTICLE V

Borrower shall be permitted, upon notice to the Administrative Agent and each Lender to create up to three (3) additional industry classification groups for purposes of this Agreement.   
  (b)  Portfolio Valuation, Etc .      (i)  Settlement Date Basis . Solely for purposes of determining the Borrowing Base, all determinations of whether an investment is to be included as a Portfolio Investment shall be determined on a
settlement-date basis (meaning that any investment that has been purchased will not be treated as a Portfolio Investment until such purchase has settled, and any Portfolio Investment which has been sold will not be excluded as a Portfolio Investment
until such sale has settled);  provided  that no such investment shall be included as a Portfolio Investment to the extent that it has not been paid for in full.   
  (ii)  Determination of Values . The Borrower will conduct reviews of the value to be assigned to each of its
Portfolio Investment as follows:      (A)  Quoted Investments   External Review . With respect to
Portfolio Investments (including Cash Equivalents) for which market quotations are readily available (  Quoted Investments  ), the Borrower shall, not less frequently than once each calendar week, determine the market value of such
Portfolio Investments which shall, in each case, be determined in accordance with one of the following methodologies (as selected by the Borrower):      (w) in the case of public and 144A securities, the average of the mean prices as determined by two (2) Approved Dealers selected by the Borrower,   
         66   

(x) in the case of bank loans, the mean price as determined by one (1)
Approved Dealer or Approved Pricing Service selected by the Borrower,      (y) in the case of any Portfolio
Investment traded on an exchange, the closing price for such Portfolio Investment most recently posted on such exchange, and      (z) in the case of any other Portfolio Investment, the fair market value thereof as determined by an Approved Pricing Service; and   
  (B)  Unquoted Investments   External Review . With respect to Portfolio Investments for which market quotations
are not readily available (  Unquoted Investments  ), the Borrower shall request an Approved Third-Party Appraiser to assist the Board of Directors of the Borrower in determining the fair market value of such Portfolio Investments, as
at the last day of each fiscal quarter;  provided   that , the Board of Directors of the Borrower shall be permitted to determine the fair market value of such Portfolio Investments without the assistance of any Approved Third-Party
Appraiser for Portfolio Investments representing no more than 10% of the Borrowing Base at any time of determination;  provided   further , that the Value of any such Portfolio Investment (i.e. a Portfolio Investment for which market
quotations are not readily available) acquired during a fiscal quarter shall be deemed to be equal to the cost of such Portfolio Investment until such time as the fair market value of such Portfolio Investment is determined in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this sub-clause (B) as at the last day of such fiscal quarter;      (C)  Internal
Review . The Borrower shall conduct internal reviews of all Portfolio Investments at least once each calendar week which shall take into account any events of which the Borrower has knowledge that materially and adversely affect the value of the
Portfolio Investments. The lower value of any Portfolio Investment as most recently determined pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) and pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A) and (B) shall be deemed to be the  Value  of such
Portfolio Investment for purposes hereof;      (D)  Failure to Determine Values . If the Borrower shall fail
to determine the value of any Portfolio Investment for which market quotation(s) are not readily available as at any date pursuant to the requirements of the foregoing sub-clauses (A) or (B), then the  Value  of such Portfolio
Investment as at such date shall be deemed to be zero until such time as the value of such Portfolio Investment is otherwise determined or reviewed, as applicable, in accordance herewith.   
  (c)  Scheduled Testing of Values .   
  (i) Each April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 30 of each calendar year (or such other quarterly dates as
are reasonably agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent each a   Valuation Testing   Date  ), the Administrative Agent, through a reputable independent valuation provider with experience in middle market assets
selected by the Administrative Agent (the   Independent Valuation Provider  ), will test the values as of such Valuation Testing Date determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) above of those Portfolio Investments included in the
Borrowing Base selected by the Administrative Agent. The fair value of such Portfolio Investments tested as of any Valuation Testing Date shall be approximately equal to the Tested Amount (as defined below).   
  (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, the  Tested Amount  shall be equal to the greater of: (A) an amount equal
to (y) 125% of the Covered Debt Amount (as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date)  minus  (z) the sum of the values of all Quoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date) and (B) 10% of the
aggregate value of all Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base;  provided ,  however , in no event shall more than 25% of the aggregate value of the Unquoted Investments in the Borrowing Base be tested by the Independent
Valuation Provider in respect of any applicable Valuation Testing Date (or, if clause (B) applies, 10%, or as near thereto as reasonably practicable).      (iii) With respect to any Portfolio Investment, if the value of such Portfolio Investment determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is not more than the lesser of (A) 110% of the
midpoint of the   
         67   

valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider and (B) five (5) points more than the midpoint of the valuation range (expressed as a percent of par) provided by the Independent
Valuation Provider (provided that the value of such Portfolio Investment is customarily quoted as a percentage of par, otherwise this clause (B) shall not be applicable), then the value for such Portfolio Investment determined by the Borrower in
accordance with Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the  Value  for purposes of this Agreement. If the value of any Portfolio Investment determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is greater than the lesser of
the values set forth in clause (iii)(A) and (B) (to the extent applicable), then for such Portfolio Investment, the  Value  for purposes of this Agreement shall become the lesser of (x) the highest value of the valuation range provided by
the Independent Valuation Provider, (y) five (5) points more than the midpoint of the valuation range (expressed as a percent of par) provided by the Independent Valuation Provider (provided that the value of such Portfolio Investment is customarily
quoted as a percentage of par, otherwise this clause (y) shall not be applicable) and (z) 110% of the midpoint of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, any values determined by the
Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to this Section 5.12(c) or Section 5.12(d) shall be used solely for purposes of determining the  Value  of a Portfolio Investment under this Agreement and shall not be deemed to be the fair value of
such asset as required under ASC 820 and the Investment Company Act.      (d)  Supplemental Testing of
Values .      (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent, individually or at the request of the
Required Lenders, shall at any time have the right to request, in its reasonable discretion, any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base with a value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) to be independently tested
by the Independent Valuation Provider. There shall be no limit on the number of such tests that may be requested by the Administrative Agent in the exercise of its reasonable discretion.   
  (ii) If (A) the value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is less than the value determined by the
Independent Valuation Provider, then the value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the  Value  for purposes of this Agreement and (B) the value determined by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 5.12(b)(ii) is greater than the value determined by the Independent Valuation Provider and the difference between such values is: (x) less than 5% of the value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the value
determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall become the  Value  for purposes of this Agreement; (y) between 5% and 20% of the value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the
 Value  of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement shall become the average of the value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) and the value determined by such Independent Valuation Provider; and (z)
greater than 20% of the value determined by the Borrower pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall retain an additional third party appraiser to conduct a valuation of such Portfolio Investment and, upon
the completion of such appraisal, the  Value  of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement shall become the average of the three valuations (with the average of the Independent Valuation Provider s value and the
Borrower s value to be used as the  Value  until the third value is obtained).      (iii) The Value
of any Portfolio Investment for which the Independent Valuation Provider s value is used shall be the midpoint of the range (if any) determined by the Independent Valuation Provider.   
  (e)  Generally Applicable Valuation Provisions .   
  (i) The Independent Valuation Provider shall apply a recognized valuation methodology that is commonly accepted in the
Borrower s industry for valuing Portfolio Investments of the type being valued and held by the Obligors. Other procedures relating to the valuation will be reasonably agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.   
  (ii) All valuations shall be on a settlement date basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Value of any Portfolio Investment
determined in accordance with this Section 5.12 shall be the Value of such Portfolio   
         68   

Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a new Value for such Portfolio Investment is subsequently determined in good faith in accordance with this Section 5.12.   
  (iii) The values determined by the Independent Valuation Provider shall be deemed to be  Information  hereunder
and subject to Section 9.13 hereof.      (iv) All tests by the Independent Valuation Provider shall be conducted in
a manner not disruptive to the business of the Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of its receipt of the final results of any such test promptly upon its receipt thereof and shall provide a copy of such results and the
related report to the Borrower promptly upon the Borrower s request.      (f)  Regulated Investment Company
Diversification Requirement . The Borrower will, and will cause its Subsidiaries (other than Financing Subsidiaries that are exempt from the Investment Company Act) at all times to, subject to applicable grace periods set forth in the Code,
comply with the portfolio diversification and similar requirements set forth in the Code applicable to RIC s.      SECTION
5.13.  Calculation of Borrowing Base . (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the  Borrowing Base  shall be determined, as at any date of determination, as the sum of the Advance Rates of the Value of each Portfolio Investment
(excluding any cash held by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(k)), provided that:      (i) the
Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments (other than Cash and Cash Equivalents) of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities, in accordance with GAAP, that exceeds 10% of
Shareholders  Equity of the Borrower (which, for purposes of this calculation shall exclude the aggregate amount of investments in, and advances to, Financing Subsidiaries) shall be 50% of the Advance Rate otherwise applicable;   
  (ii) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments (other than Cash and
Cash Equivalents) of all issuers in a consolidated group of corporations or other entities, in accordance with GAAP, exceeding 20% of Shareholders  Equity of the Borrower (which, for purposes of this calculation shall exclude the aggregate
amount of investments in, and advances to, Financing Subsidiaries) shall be 0%;      (iii) the Advance Rate
applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments (other than Cash and Cash Equivalents) attributable to common equity, warrants, Portfolio Investments that are not Performing and Portfolio Investments where less than
66.67% of the interest (including accretions and  pay-in-kind  interest) for the current monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual period (as applicable) is payable in cash, exceeding 20% of the Borrowing Base shall be 0%;   
  (iv) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments (other than Cash and
Cash Equivalents) in any single Industry Classification Group that exceeds 20% of Shareholders  Equity of the Borrower (which for purposes of this calculation shall exclude the aggregate amount of investments in, and advances to, Financing
Subsidiaries) shall be 0%;  provided   that , with respect to the Portfolio Investments in a single Industry Classification Group from time to time designated by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, such 20% figure shall be increased
to 30% and, accordingly, only to the extent that the Value for such single Industry Classification Group exceeds 30% of the Shareholders  Equity shall the Advance Rate applicable to such excess Value be 0%;   
  (v) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments (other than Common
Equity) in which the Borrower has a controlling influence as determined under the Investment Company Act that exceeds 5% of Shareholders  Equity of the Borrower (which for purposes of this calculation shall exclude the aggregate amount of
investments in, and advances to, Financing Subsidiaries) shall be the Advance Rate applicable to Performing Common Equity (to the extent such Portfolio Investments are Performing) or 0%,   
  (vi) The Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the aggregate Value of the Portfolio Investments (other than Cash and
Cash Equivalents) attributable to Venture Loans exceeding 45% of the Borrowing Base shall be 0%, and   
         69   

(vii) the Advance Rate applicable to that portion of the Value of the
Portfolio Investments attributable to any investment in a Financing Subsidiary shall be 0%.      (b) No Portfolio Investment may
be included in the Borrowing Base until such time as such Portfolio Investment has been Delivered (as defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) to the Collateral Agent, and then only for so long as such Portfolio Investment continues to be
Delivered as contemplated therein; provided that in the case of any Portfolio Investment in which the Collateral Agent has a first priority perfected security interest pursuant to a valid Uniform Commercial Code filing (and for which no other method

relating to any Secured Longer-Term Indebtedness or Unsecured Longer-Term Indebtedness that would result in such Indebtedness not meeting the requirements of the definition of  Secured Longer-Term Indebtedness  and  Unsecured
Longer-Term Indebtedness , as applicable, set forth in Section 1.01 of this Agreement, unless (i) in the case of Secured Longer-Term Indebtedness, such Indebtedness would have been permitted to be incurred as Secured Shorter-Term
Indebtedness at the time of such modification, supplement or waiver and the Borrower so designates such Indebtedness as  Secured Shorter-Term Indebtedness  (whereupon such Indebtedness shall be deemed to constitute  Secured
Shorter-Term Indebtedness  for all purposes of this Agreement) and (ii) in the case of Unsecured Longer-Term Indebtedness, such Indebtedness would have been permitted to be incurred as Unsecured Shorter-Term Indebtedness at the time of
such modification, supplement or waiver and the Borrower so designates such Indebtedness as  Unsecured Shorter-Term Indebtedness  (whereupon such Indebtedness shall be deemed to constitute  Unsecured Shorter-Term Indebtedness 
for all purposes of this Agreement) or      (b) any of the Affiliate Agreements (other than in connection with any Permitted
Directing Body-Approved Affiliate Transaction), unless such modification, supplement or waiver is not less favorable to the Borrower than could be obtained on an arm s-length basis from unrelated third parties.

effectively stayed, discharged or bonded pending appeal, or liability for such judgment amount shall not have been admitted by an insurer of reputable standing reasonably acceptable to the Required Lenders or any action shall be legally taken by a
judgment creditor to attach or levy upon any assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to enforce any such judgment;

and clear of all other Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section 6.02 or under the respective Security Documents); provided that if such default is as a result of any action of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent or a failure of
the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent to take any action within its control, such default shall continue unremedied for a period of ten (10) consecutive Business Days after the Borrower receives written notice thereof from the Administrative

(i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall   
         80   

terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may

and under the other Loan Documents, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

   ARTICLE VIII        THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT       SECTION 8.01.  Appointment and Authority .
Each Lender Party hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank, N.A. as its administrative agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article (other than the first sentence of Section 8.06(a)) are solely for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties, and neither the Borrower nor any other Obligor shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.   
  SECTION 8.02.  Administrative Agent Individually . (a) The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender Party as any other Lender Party and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term  Lender Party  or  Lender Parties  shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as a financial
advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account
therefor to the Lender Parties.      (b) Each Lender Party understands that the Person serving as Administrative Agent, acting in
its individual capacity, and its Affiliates (collectively, the   Agent s Group  ) are engaged in a wide range of financial services and businesses (including investment management, financing, securities trading, corporate and
investment banking and research) (such services and businesses are collectively referred to in this Article VIII as   Activities  ) and may engage in the Activities with or on behalf of one or more of the Obligors or their respective
Affiliates. Furthermore, the Agent s Group may, in undertaking the Activities, engage in trading in financial products or undertake other investment businesses for its own account or on behalf of others (including the Obligors and their
Affiliates and including holding, for its own account or on behalf of others, equity, debt and similar positions in the Borrower, another Obligor or their respective Affiliates), including trading in or
  
         81   

holding long, short or derivative positions in securities, loans or other financial products of one or more of the Obligors or their Affiliates. Each Lender Party understands and agrees that in
engaging in the Activities, the Agent s Group may receive or otherwise obtain information concerning the Obligors or their Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Obligors to perform their respective Obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents) which information may not be available to any of the Lender Parties that are not members of the Agent s Group. None of the Administrative Agent nor any member of the Agent s Group shall have
any duty to disclose to any Lender Party or use on behalf of the Lender Parties, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, any information whatsoever about or derived from the Activities or otherwise (including any information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any Obligor or any Affiliate of any Obligor) or to account for any revenue or profits obtained in connection with the Activities, except
that the Administrative Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender Party such documents as are expressly required by any Loan Document to be transmitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lender Parties.   
  (c) Each Lender Party further understands that there may be situations where members of the Agent s Group or their respective
customers (including the Obligors and their Affiliates) either now have or may in the future have interests or take actions that may conflict with the interests of any one or more of the Lender Parties (including the interests of the Lender Parties
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents). Each Lender Party agrees that no member of the Agent s Group is or shall be required to restrict its activities as a result of the Person serving as Administrative Agent being a member of the
Agent s Group, and that each member of the Agent s Group may undertake any Activities without further consultation with or notification to any Lender Party. None of (i) this Agreement nor any other Loan Document, (ii) the receipt by the
Agent s Group of information (including Information) concerning the Obligors or their Affiliates (including information concerning the ability of the Obligors to perform their respective Obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents)
nor (iii) any other matter shall give rise to any fiduciary, equitable or contractual duties (including without limitation any duty of trust or confidence) owing by the Administrative Agent or any member of the Agent s Group to any Lender Party
including any such duty that would prevent or restrict the Agent s Group from acting on behalf of customers (including the Obligors or their Affiliates) or for its own account.   
  SECTION 8.03.  Duties of Administrative Agent; Exculpatory Provisions . (a) The Administrative Agent s duties
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are solely ministerial and administrative in nature and the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, but shall be required to act or refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so
acting or refraining from acting) upon the written direction of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents),  provided  that the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law,
including for the avoidance of doubt, any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor
Relief Law.      (b) The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the
consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in
Sections 9.02 or Article VIII) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or the event or events that give or may give rise to any
Default unless and until the Borrower or any Lender Party shall have given notice to the Administrative Agent describing such Default and such event or events.      (c) Neither the Administrative Agent nor any member of the Agent s Group shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty, representation or
other information made or   
         82   

supplied in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection
herewith or therewith or the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of the information contained therein, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the
occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or the perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest
created or purported to be created by the Security Documents or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than (but subject to the foregoing clause (ii)) to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.      (d) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall require
the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties to carry out any  know your customer  or other checks in relation to any person on behalf of any Lender Party and each Lender Party confirms to the Administrative Agent that it is
solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.   
  SECTION 8.04.  Reliance by Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any
liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and
to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender Party, the Administrative Agent
may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender Party unless an officer of the Administrative Agent responsible for the transactions contemplated hereby shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender Party prior to the
making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit, and in the case of a Borrowing, such Lender Party shall not have made available to the Administrative Agent such Lender Party s ratable portion of such Borrowing. The Administrative
Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower or any other Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice
of any such counsel, accountants or experts.      SECTION 8.05.  Delegation of Duties . The Administrative Agent may perform
any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more  sub-agents  appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
and any such  sub-agent  may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. Each such  sub-agent  and
the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and each such sub-agent shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03   (as though such sub-agents were the  Administrative Agent  under the
Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.      SECTION 8.06.  Resignation of Administrative
Agent . (a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lender Parties and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the
Borrower, not to be unreasonably withheld (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in consultation with the Borrower), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such
bank with an office in New York, New York. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30)days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its
resignation (such 30-day period, the   Lender Party Appointment Period  ), then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lender Parties, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth
above. In addition and without any obligation on the part of the retiring Administrative Agent to appoint, on behalf of the Lender Parties, a successor Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent may at any time upon or after the end of
the Lender Party Appointment Period notify the Borrower and the Lender Parties   
         83   

that no qualifying Person has accepted appointment as successor Administrative Agent and the effective date of such retiring Administrative Agent s resignation which effective date shall be
no earlier than three (3) Business Days after the date of such notice. Upon the resignation effective date established in such notice and regardless of whether a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the
retiring Administrative Agent s resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender Party directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,
privileges and duties as Administrative Agent of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between
the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
retiring Administrative Agent, its  sub-agents  and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as
Administrative Agent.      (b) Any resignation pursuant to this Section by a Person acting as Administrative Agent shall, unless
such Person shall notify the Borrower and the Lender Parties otherwise, also act to relieve such Person and its Affiliates of any obligation to advance or issue new, or extend existing, Swingline Loans or Letters of Credit where such advance,
issuance or extension is to occur on or after the effective date of such resignation. Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, (ii) the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, (iii) the successor Swingline Lender shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption and acquire from the retiring Swingline Lender each outstanding Swingline Loan of such retiring Swingline Lender for a purchase price equal to par plus
accrued interest and (iv) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, issued by the retiring Issuing Bank and outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangement
satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit.      (c) In addition to the foregoing, if a Lender becomes, and during the period it remains, a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Bank and/or any Swingline Lender may, upon prior written notice to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent, resign as Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, respectively, effective at the close of business New York time on a date specified in such notice (which date may not be less than five (5) Business Days after the date of
such notice);  provided   that  such resignation by the Issuing Bank will have no effect on the validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit then outstanding or on the obligations of the Borrower or any Lender under this Agreement
with respect to any such outstanding Letter of Credit or otherwise to the Issuing Bank; and  provided ,  further , that such resignation by any Swingline Lender will have no effect on its rights in respect of any outstanding Swingline
Loans or on the obligations of the Borrower or any Lender under this Agreement with respect to any such outstanding Swingline Loan.      SECTION 8.07.  Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lender Parties . (a) Each Lender Party confirms to the Administrative Agent, each other Lender Party and each of their respective
Related Parties that it (i) possesses (individually or through its Related Parties) such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable, without reliance on the Administrative Agent, any other Lender Party or any of
their respective Related Parties, of evaluating the merits and risks (including tax, legal, regulatory, credit,   
         84   

accounting and other financial matters) of (x) entering into this Agreement, (y) making Loans and other extensions of credit hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (z) in taking or
not taking actions hereunder and thereunder, (ii) is financially able to bear such risks and (iii) has determined that entering into this Agreement and making Loans and other extensions of credit hereunder and under the other Loan Documents is
suitable and appropriate for it.      (b) Each Lender Party acknowledges that (i) it is solely responsible for making its own
independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender Party or any
of their respective Related Parties, made its own appraisal and investigation of all risks associated with, and its own credit analysis and decision to enter into, this Agreement based on such documents and information, as it has deemed appropriate
and (iii) it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender Party or any of their respective Related Parties, continue to be solely responsible for making its own appraisal and investigation of all risks
arising under or in connection with, and its own credit analysis and decision to take or not take action under, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, which
may include, in each case:      (i) the financial condition, status and capitalization of the Borrower and each
other Obligor;      (ii) the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of this Agreement and
each other Loan Document and any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Loan Document;   
  (iii) determining compliance or non-compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a
Letter of Credit and the form and substance of all evidence delivered in connection with establishing the satisfaction of each such condition; and      (iv) the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information delivered by the Administrative Agent, any other Lender Party or by any of their respective Related Parties under or in connection with
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Loan Document.   
  SECTION 8.08.  Removal of Administrative Agent . Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time the Required
Lenders determine that the Person serving as Administrative Agent is (without taking into account any provision in the definition of  Defaulting Lender  requiring notice from the Administrative Agent or any other party) a Defaulting
Lender, the Required Lenders (determined after giving effect to Section 9.02) may by notice to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), appoint a replacement Administrative Agent hereunder. Such removal will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be effective on the earlier of (i) the date a replacement Administrative Agent is appointed and (ii) the date
thirty (30) Business Days after the giving of such notice by the Required Lenders (regardless of whether a replacement Administrative Agent has been appointed).      SECTION 8.09.  No Other Duties .

of the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party to deliver any Approved Electronic Communication to any Obligor in any manner authorized in this Agreement or to request that the Borrower effect delivery in such manner.   
  (b)  Posting of Electronic Communications . (i) Each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor agree that the Administrative Agent
may, but shall not be obligated to, make the Approved Electronic Communications available to the Lender Parties by posting such Approved Electronic Communications on Debt Domain  or a substantially similar electronic platform chosen by the
Administrative Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the   Approved Electronic Platform  ).      (ii) Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Administrative Agent from
time to time (including, as of the Effective Date, a dual firewall and a User ID/Password Authorization System) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a single-user-per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the
Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are
confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. In consideration for the convenience and other benefits afforded by such distribution and for the other consideration provided hereunder, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor hereby approves distribution of the Approved Electronic Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution.   
  (iii) THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED  AS IS  AND

MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE AGENT PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED
ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.   
         87   

(iv) Each of the Lender Parties and each Obligor agree that the
Administrative Agent may, but (except as may be required by applicable law) shall not be obligated to, store the Approved Electronic Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in accordance with the Administrative Agent s
generally-applicable document retention procedures and policies.      SECTION 9.02. Waivers; Amendments.   
  (a)  No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative . No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default,
regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.      (b)  Amendments to this Agreement . Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;  provided  that no such agreement shall:   
  (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender,   
  (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,      (iii) postpone the scheduled
date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,      (iv) change Section 2.17(b),
(c) or (d) in a manner that would alter the  pro rata  sharing of payments, or making of disbursements, required thereby without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, or   
  (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage in the definition of the term  Required
Lenders  or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender
affected thereby;       provided   further  that (x) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties
of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lenders hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or each Swingline Lender, as the case may be and (y) the consent of Lenders holding
not less than two-thirds of the Revolving Credit Exposure, Term Loans and unused Commitments will be required (A) for any adverse change affecting the provisions of this Agreement relating to the determination of the Borrowing Base (including the
definitions used therein), or the provisions of Section 5.12(b)(ii), and (B) for any release of any material portion of the Collateral other than for fair value or as otherwise permitted hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.
     Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Lenders of any Class in a manner that does not affect all Classes equally shall be effective against the Lenders of such Class unless the Required Lenders of such
Class shall have concurred with such waiver or modification.   
         88   

(c)  Amendments to Security Documents . No Security Document nor any provision thereof
may be waived, amended or modified, nor may the Liens thereof be spread to secure any additional obligations (including any increase in Loans hereunder, but excluding any such increase pursuant to a Commitment Increase under Section 2.08(e) to
an amount not greater than $800,000,000) except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower, and by the Collateral Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;  provided  that, (i) without the written
consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the Obligors from their respective obligations under the Security Documents and (ii) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release
all or substantially all of the collateral security or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under the Security Documents, alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the Liens created under the Security
Documents (except in connection with securing additional obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder) with respect to all or substantially all of the collateral security provided thereby, or release all or
substantially all of the guarantors under the Guarantee and Security Agreement from their guarantee obligations thereunder, except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (and so agrees with the
Borrower) to direct the Collateral Agent under the Guarantee and Security Agreement, to (1) release any Lien covering property (and to release any such guarantor) that is the subject of either a disposition of property permitted hereunder or a
disposition to which the Required Lenders have consented (and each Lender hereby consents to and authorizes the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to enter into, any agreement, instrument or document acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, that is necessary to terminate any Security Document that (x) exclusively covers property which is released from a Lien in accordance with the foregoing, (y) exclusively covers
property which property has become subject to the Lien of the Lenders pursuant to another Security Document acceptable to the Administrative Agent or (z) no longer covers any Collateral) and (2) release from the Guarantee and Security Agreement any
Subsidiary Guarantor (and any property of such Subsidiary Guarantor) that is designated as a Financing Subsidiary in accordance with this Agreement or which ceases to be consolidated on the Borrower s financial statements and is no longer
required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor, so long as (A) after giving effect to any such release under this clause (2) (and any concurrent acquisitions of Portfolio Investments or payment of outstanding Loans) the Covered Debt Amount does not exceed
the Borrowing Base and the Borrower delivers a certificate of a Financial Officer to such effect to the Administrative Agent, (B) either (I) the amount of any excess availability under the Borrowing Base immediately prior to such release is not
diminished as a result of such release or (II) the Borrowing Base immediately after giving effect to such release is at least 110% of the Covered Debt Amount and (C) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   
  (d)  Defaulting Lenders . Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during such period as a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender will not be entitled to vote in respect of amendments and waivers hereunder and the Commitment and the outstanding Loans or other extensions of credit of such Lender hereunder will not be
taken into account in determining whether the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as required, have approved any such amendment or waiver (and the definition of  Required Lenders  will automatically be deemed modified accordingly for
the duration of such period);  provided ,  that  any such amendment or waiver that would increase or extend the term of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, extend the date fixed for the payment of principal or interest owing to such
Defaulting Lender hereunder, reduce the principal amount of any obligation owing to such Defaulting Lender, reduce the amount of or the rate or amount of interest on any amount owing to such Defaulting Lender or of any fee payable to such Defaulting
Lender hereunder, or alter the terms of this proviso, will require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.      (e)  Replacement
of Non-Consenting Lender . If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination to any of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by this Section 9.02, the Borrower has obtained the consent of the Required Lenders
but the consent of one or more Lenders (each a  Non-Consenting Lender ) whose consent is required for such change, waiver, discharge or termination is not obtained, then (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the
Borrower shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to replace each such Non-Consenting Lender with one or more replacement Lenders pursuant to Section   
         89   

2.18(b) so long as at the time of such replacement, each such replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination.   
  SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.      (a)  Costs and Expenses . The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arranger and their
Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, (iii) all documented out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or
protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof and (iv) and all documented costs, expenses, taxes, assessments and other charges incurred in connection with any filing, registration, recording or perfection of any
security interest contemplated by any Security Document or any other document referred to therein. Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall not be responsible for the reimbursement of any (i) fees, costs and
expenses of the Independent Valuation Provider incurred pursuant to Section 5.12(d) and (ii) any fees, costs and expenses incurred in accordance with Section 5.06(b), collectively in an aggregate amount in excess of $200,000 in the aggregate
incurred for all such fees, costs and expenses in any 12-month period (the   IVP Supplemental Cap  ).      (b)
 Indemnification by the Borrower . The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
  Indemnitee  ) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (other than Taxes or Other Taxes which shall only be indemnified by the Borrower to the extent
provided in Section 2.16), including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of
this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any
Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the
terms of such Letter of Credit) or (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is
a party thereto;  provided  that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee or (ii) a claim against such Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee s obligations under this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, if a final and nonappealable judgment against such Indemnitee has been obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction. This Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses
or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.      The Borrower shall not be liable to any Indemnitee for any special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of the Transactions asserted by an Indemnitee against the Borrower or any other Obligor, provided that the foregoing limitation shall not be deemed to impair or
affect the Obligations of the Borrower under the preceding provisions of this subsection.   
         90   

(c)  Reimbursement by Lenders . To the extent that the Borrower for any reason fails to
indefeasibly pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender or any Related Party of the foregoing under paragraph (a) or
(b) of this Section or to the extent that the fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Valuation Provider incurred pursuant to Section 5.12(d) or the fees, costs and expenses incurred in accordance with Section 5.06(b) exceed the IVP
Supplemental Cap for any 12-month period, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent), the Collateral Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Swingline Lender or such Related Party, as the case may be, such
Lender s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;  provided  that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Collateral Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Swingline Lender in its capacity as such, or against any Related
Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the Collateral Agent, any such Issuing Bank or any such Swingline Lender in connection with such capacity.   
  (d)  Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc . To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby
waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.   
  (e)  Payments . All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.   
  (f)  No Fiduciary Duty . Each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the
 Banks ), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Obligors, their stockholders and/or their affiliates. Each Obligor agrees that nothing in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to
create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Bank, on the one hand, and such Obligor, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other. The Obligors acknowledge and agree that (i) the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm s-length commercial transactions between the Banks, on the one hand, and the Obligors, on the other, and (ii) in
connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Bank has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Obligor, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the
exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Bank has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Obligor, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other
obligation to any Obligor except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Bank is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Obligor, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person.
Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process
leading thereto. Each Obligor agrees that it will not claim that any Bank has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Obligor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading
thereto.      SECTION 9.04. Successors and Assigns.   
  (a)  Assignments Generally . The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person   
         91   

(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent
expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.   
  (b)  Assignments by Lenders .   
  (i)  Assignments Generally . Subject to the conditions set forth in clause (ii) below, any Lender may assign to
one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans and LC Exposure at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:      (A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be
required for an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee;  provided  that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it
shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after notice is delivered by the applicable Lender to the Borrower in accordance with Section 9.01(a)(ii)(i); and   
  (B) the Administrative Agent, each Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank.   
  (ii) Certain Conditions to Assignments. Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:   
  (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining
amount of the assigning Lender s Commitment or Loans and LC Exposure of a Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans and LC Exposure of such Class of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than U.S. $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of
the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;      (B) each partial
assignment of any Class of Commitments or Loans and LC Exposure shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Class of Commitments, Loans and
LC Exposure;      (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, together with a processing and recordation fee of U.S. $3,500 (which fee shall not be payable in connection with an assignment to a Lender or to an Affiliate of a Lender
or an Approved Fund), for which the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not be obligated;      (D) the
assignee, if it shall not already be a Lender of the applicable Class, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;      (E) no such assignment will be made to any Defaulting Lender or any of their respective subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting Lender; and
     (F) no such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust
for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person).      (iii)  Effectiveness of
Assignments . Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption,
be   
         92   

released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (f) of this Section.      (iv)  Defaulting Lender Assignments .
In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment will be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment make
such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating
actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable  pro rata  share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and
assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lenders and each other Lender hereunder (and interest
accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full  pro rata  share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in the applicable Class. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder becomes effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest will be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for
all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.      (c)  Maintenance of Registers by Administrative Agent . The
Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses
of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the   Registers   and each individually, a
  Register  ). The entries in the Registers shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Registers
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Registers shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.      (d)  Acceptance of Assignments by Administrative Agent . Upon its
receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the
information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.   
  (e)  Special Purposes Vehicles . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a   Granting
Lender  ) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an   SPC  ) owned or administered by such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower, the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make;  provided  that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any SPC, (ii) if an SPC
elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement, make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof, (iii) the rights of any such SPC
shall be derivative of the rights of the Granting Lender, and such SPC shall be subject to all of the restrictions upon the Granting Lender herein contained, and (iv) no SPC shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14 (or any other
increased costs protection provision), 2.15 or 2.16. Each   
         93   

SPC shall be conclusively presumed to have made arrangements with its Granting Lender for the exercise of voting and other rights hereunder in a manner which is acceptable to the SPC, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders and the Borrower, and each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Obligors shall be entitled to rely upon and deal solely with the Granting Lender with respect to Loans made by or through
its SPC. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by the Granting Lender.   
  Each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one (1)
year and one (1) day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, in respect of claims arising out of this Agreement;  provided  that the Granting Lender for each SPC hereby agrees to indemnify, save and
hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage and expense arising out of their inability to institute any such proceeding against its SPC. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any
SPC may (i) without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Lender or to any financial
institutions providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued by such SPC to fund such Loans (but nothing contained herein shall be
construed in derogation of the obligation of the Granting Lender to make Loans hereunder);  provided  that neither the consent of the SPC or of any such assignee shall be required for amendments or waivers hereunder except for those amendments
or waivers for which the consent of participants is required under paragraph (f) below, and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis (in the same manner described in Section 9.13(b)) any non-public information relating to its Loans to
any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.   
  (f)  Participations . Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, sell participations to one or more regulated banking
institutions or insurance companies or any Affiliate of a Lender and, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to one or more other entities (a   Participant  ) in all or a portion of
such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to it);  provided  that (i) the consent of the Borrower
shall not be required if such Participant does not have the right to receive any non-public information that may be provided pursuant to this Agreement (and the Lender selling such participation agrees with the Borrower at the time of the sale of
such participation that it will not deliver such non-public information to the Participant), (ii) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (iii) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iv) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document;  provided  that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender
will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (g) of this Section, the Borrower agrees
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender;  provided  such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(d) as though it were a Lender hereunder.
     (g)  Limitations on Rights of Participants . A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
  
         94   

Borrower s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the sale of the
participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender and in the case of a Participant
claiming exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, the applicable Lender shall provide the Borrower with satisfactory evidence that the participation is in registered form and shall permit the Borrower to
review such register as reasonably needed for the Borrower to comply with its obligations under applicable laws and regulations.      (h)  Participant Register . Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and
address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the  Participant Register   provided  that no Lender shall
have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other
obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United
States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all
purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.   
  (i)  Certain Pledges . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a
security interest;  provided  that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.   
  (j)  No Assignments to the Borrower or Affiliates . Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign
or participate any interest in its Commitments or any Loan or LC Exposure held by it hereunder to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent of each Lender.   
  SECTION 9.05.  Survival . All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of
any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under
this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain
in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.      SECTION 9.06.  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution .   
  (a)  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with
  
         95   

respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the
Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.   
  (b)  Electronic Execution of Assignments . The words  execution,   signed,   signature,  and words of
like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature
or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures
and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.      SECTION 9.07.
 Severability . Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.   
  SECTION 9.08.  Right of Setoff . If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its
Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at
any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Obligor against any of and all the obligations of any Obligor now or hereafter existing under the Loan Documents held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which
such Lender may have;  provided  that in the event that any Defaulting Lender exercises any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off will be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.19(b) and, pending such payment, will be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lenders and the
Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender will provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.   
  SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.      (a)  Governing Law . This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by
law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
  
         96   

judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.      (c)
 Waiver of Venue . The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding

maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.      (d)  Service of Process . Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

  SECTION 9.11.  Judgment Currency . This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars or any Foreign
Currency, as the case may be (the   Specified Currency  ), and payment in New York City or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the   Specified Place  ), is of the essence, and the Specified
Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency. The payment obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall not be discharged or satisfied by an amount paid in another currency
or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the
Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the   Second Currency  ),
the rate of exchange that shall be applied shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding the day on
which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in this Section called an   Entitled
Person  ) shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder in
the Second Currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and the Borrower hereby, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in the Specified Currency, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such Entitled
Person in the Specified Currency hereunder exceeds the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred.      SECTION
9.12.  Headings . Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting,

authorizes each Lender to share any information delivered to such Lender by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or
affiliate, it being understood that any such subsidiary or affiliate receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such authorization shall survive the repayment
of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.      (b)  Confidentiality . Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Lender Parties agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may

any other Loan Document, the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder or any litigation or proceeding to which the Administrative Agent, any Lender Party or any of its respective Affiliates may be a party, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement;  provided 
 that , unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required prior to the disclosure of any Information to a potential assignee or

connection with ratings issued with respect to a Securitization or (m) in connection with any pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender permitted by Section 9.04(i). For purposes of
this Section,   Securitization   means a public or private offering by a Lender or any of its Affiliates or their respective successors and assigns, of securities which represent an interest in, or which are collateralized, in whole
or in part, by the Loans or the Loan Documents.      For purposes of this Section,   Information   means all
information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or
the Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;  provided  that, in the case of   
         98   

information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to

officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:      a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
during the period in which this report is being prepared;      b) designed such internal control over financial
reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;     c) evaluated the effectiveness of the
registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
     d) disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal
control over financial reporting; and      5. The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our
most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):   
  a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and      b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
