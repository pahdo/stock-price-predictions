  September 30, 2016   
 (unaudited)     NOTE A   BASIS OF
PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY ACCOUNTING POLICIES      Organization and business   
 Lifetime Brands, Inc. (the  Company ) designs, sources and sells branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home and markets its
products under a number of brand names and trademarks, which are either owned or licensed by the Company, or through retailers  private labels. The Company markets and sells its products principally on a wholesale basis to retailers. The
Company also markets and sells a limited selection of its products directly to consumers through its Pfaltzgraff, Mikasa, Fred and Friends, Built NY, Lifetime Sterling and The English Table internet websites.  
  Basis of presentation     The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring accruals,
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Operating results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the year ending December 31, 2016.    The Company s business and working capital needs are highly seasonal, with a majority of sales occurring in
the third and fourth quarters. In 2015 and 2014, net sales for the third and fourth quarters accounted for 59% and 60% of total annual net sales, respectively. In anticipation of the pre-holiday shipping season, inventory levels increase primarily
in the June through October time period.     Revenue recognition   
 The Company sells products wholesale, to retailers and distributors, and retail, directly to the consumer. Wholesale sales and retail sales are recognized when
title passes to the customer, which is primarily at the shipping point for wholesale sales and upon delivery to the customer for retail sales. Shipping and handling fees that are billed primarily to retail customers in sales transactions are
included in net sales and amounted to $302,000 and $313,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30,
2015. Net sales exclude taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to the taxing authorities.    The Company offers various sales incentives and
promotional programs to its wholesale customers from time to time in the normal course of business. These incentives and promotions typically include arrangements such as cooperative advertising, buydowns, volume rebates and discounts. These
arrangements and an estimate of sales returns are reflected as reductions in net sales in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  Cost of sales     Cost of sales consists primarily of costs
associated with the production and procurement of product, inbound freight costs, purchasing costs, royalties and other product procurement related charges.

 (unaudited)      
   Distribution expenses   
 Distribution expenses consist primarily of warehousing expenses and freight-out expenses.  
 In September 2016, the Company identified and corrected an error in the accumulated depreciation balance relating to certain leasehold improvements at one of
its U.S. warehouses. Accordingly, distribution expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $1.3 million of additional depreciation expense to properly reflect the accumulated depreciation balance of these assets as
of September 30, 2016.     Accounts Receivable     The
Company periodically reviews the collectability of its accounts receivable and establishes allowances for estimated losses that could result from the inability of its customers to make required payments. A considerable amount of judgment is required
to assess the ultimate realization of these receivables including assessing the initial and on-going creditworthiness of the Company s customers.  
 The Company also maintains an allowance for anticipated customer deductions. The allowances for deductions are primarily based on contracts with customers.
However, in certain cases the Company does not have a formal contract and, therefore, customer deductions are non-contractual. To evaluate the reasonableness of non-contractual customer deductions, the Company analyzes currently available
information and historical trends of deductions.    In order to reduce accounts receivable balances and improve cash flows, on September 30, 2016 the
Company entered into an uncommitted Receivables Purchase Agreement among the Company and HSBC Bank USA, National Association ( HSBC ), as Purchaser (the  Receivables Purchase Agreement ). Under the Receivables Purchase Agreement,
the Company may offer to sell certain eligible accounts receivable (the  Receivables ) to HSBC, which may accept such offer, and purchase the offered Receivables. Under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, following each purchase of
Receivables, the outstanding aggregate purchased Receivables shall not exceed $25.0 million. HSBC will assume the credit risk of the Receivables sold and the Company will be responsible for all non-credit risk matters. The Company will service the
Receivables, and as such servicer, collect and otherwise enforce the Receivables on behalf of HSBC. The term of the agreement is for 364 days and shall automatically be extended for annual successive terms unless terminated. Either party may
terminate the agreement at any time upon sixty days  prior written notice to the other party. The Company did not sell any Receivables pursuant to this agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Subsequent to
September 30, 2016, the Company sold $16.1 million of Receivables pursuant to this agreement.     Inventory   
 Inventory consists principally of finished goods sourced from third-party suppliers. Inventory also includes finished goods, work in process and raw materials
related to the Company s manufacture of sterling silver products. Inventory is priced using the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market method. The Company estimates the selling price of its inventory on a product by product basis
based on the current selling environment. If the estimated selling price is lower than the inventory s cost, the Company reduces the value of the inventory to its net realizable value.

 (unaudited)      
  The components of inventory are as follows:  
   
    Fair value of financial instruments   
 The Company determined the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are reasonable estimates of their fair
values because of their short-term nature. The Company determined that the carrying amounts of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility, term loan and short term loan approximate fair value since such borrowings bear interest at
variable market rates.     Derivatives     The Company
accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic No. 815, Derivatives and Hedging. ASC Topic No. 815 requires that all derivative instruments be recognized on the balance sheet
at fair value as either an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as hedges and have been designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes have no net impact on earnings to the extent the
derivative is considered highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged, until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. If a derivative which is designated as part of a hedging
relationship is considered ineffective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged, the changes in fair value are recorded in operations. For derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated
as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, changes in fair value are recorded in operations.     Goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets
    Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but, instead, are subject to an annual impairment assessment.
Additionally, if events or conditions were to indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable, the Company would evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at that time. As it relates to the goodwill
assessment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the
two-step goodwill impairment testing described in ASU Topic No. 350,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other . If, after assessing qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary and the Company s goodwill is considered to be unimpaired. However, if based on the Company s qualitative assessment it concludes
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, the Company will proceed with performing the two-step process. The first step
in the two-step process compares the carrying value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. Should the carrying value of a reporting unit be in excess of the estimated fair value of
that reporting unit, the second step must be performed. The second step represents a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the Company had acquired the reporting unit on that date. The Company also evaluates qualitative factors to determine
whether or not its indefinite lived intangibles have been impaired and then performs quantitative tests if required. These tests can include the relief from royalty model or other valuation models.

  Long-lived assets, including intangible assets deemed to have finite lives, are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating
profit or material adverse changes in the business climate that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired. When impairment indicators are present, the recoverability of the asset is measured by comparing the carrying value of the
asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset.     Employee healthcare     The
Company self-insures certain portions of its health insurance plans. The Company maintains an accrual for unpaid claims and estimated claims incurred but not yet reported ( IBNR ). Although management believes that it uses the best
information available to estimate claims IBNR, actual claims may vary significantly from estimated claims.     Restructuring Expenses   
 Costs associated with restructuring activities are recorded at fair value when a liability has been incurred. A liability has been incurred at the point of
closure for any remaining operating lease obligations and at the communication date for severance.    In December 2015, the Company commenced an in-depth
review of its U.S. Wholesale business segment, which included the evaluation of the segment s efficiency and effectiveness, with the objective of developing a plan to restructure its operations as appropriate. The Company expanded this
restructuring plan in the first quarter of 2016 to focus on specific actions required to achieve the plan s objectives. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $1.7 million of restructuring expense related to
the execution of this plan.    At September 30, 2016, $29,000 was accrued related to severance expense from the restructuring plan. The Company expects
the remaining severance will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company expects to incur $606,000 of additional U.S. Wholesale restructuring charges, related to severance and consulting, in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements     Effective
January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  and ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated
with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.  This guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity
deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the
line-of-credit arrangement. In connection with the adoption of this standard, debt issuance costs associated with the Company s Term Loan are presented as a deduction from the Term loan balance as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The retrospective adoption of this pronouncement results in a reduction of Other assets of $621,000, a reduction of the Current maturity of Credit Agreement Term Loan of $354,000 and a reduction of Credit Agreement Term Loan
of $267,000 on the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2015. The debt issuance costs associated with the Company s Revolving Credit Facility are presented as Other assets as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015.

 (unaudited)      
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-05,  Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid
in a Cloud Computing Arrangement , which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. The Company will apply the guidance prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after
January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.    Effective
January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-16,  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The
Company will apply the new guidance prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the January 1, 2016 effective date. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial
statements.     Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted in Future Periods   
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash
Receipts and Cash Payments , which reduces the diversity in practice on how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods
within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this pronouncement.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This standard will require all income tax effects
of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The standard will also allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than is currently allowed for tax withholding purposes without
triggering liability accounting, and will allow companies to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this pronouncement.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases,  which requires a lessee, in most leases, to initially recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within with those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this pronouncement.  
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , which affects reporting entities that measure inventory
using either the first-in, first-out or average cost method. Specifically, the guidance requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of
adopting this pronouncement, but the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common
revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Following the FASB s finalization of a one year deferral of this standard, the ASU is now effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2016. This ASU can be adopted either retrospectively to each
reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of the adoption. The Company is currently determining its implementation approach and assessing the impact, if any, on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.

   NOTE B   ACQUISITIONS   
 On September 16, 2016, the Company acquired the Amco Houseworks   , Chicago    Metallic and Swing-A-Way    kitchenware and bakeware brands, together with their related inventory, from Focus Products Group
International, LLC ( Focus ). The assets and operating results of the Focus brands are reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic No. 805,  Business
Combinations , commencing from the acquisition date. The purchase price was allocated based on the Company s preliminary estimate of the fair values of the assets acquired including, inventory ($3.5 million) and customer relationships and
trade names ($5.3 million). Customer relationships and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 15 years.  
 On October 6, 2016, the Company acquired the Copco    product line from Wilton Industries, Inc,
for cash in the amount of $12.3 million. The product line includes thermal and hydration beverageware, tea kettles and kitchen organization products. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired will be determined in the fourth quarter of
2016.     NOTE C   INVESTMENTS     The Company owns
approximately a 30% interest in Grupo Vasconia S.A.B. ( Vasconia ), an integrated manufacturer of aluminum products and one of Mexico s largest housewares companies. Shares of Vasconia s capital stock are traded on the Bolsa
Mexicana de Valores, the Mexican Stock Exchange. The Quotation Key is VASCONI. The Company accounts for its investment in Vasconia using the equity method of accounting and records its proportionate share of Vasconia s net income in the
Company s statement of operations. Accordingly, the Company has recorded its proportionate share of Vasconia s net income (reduced for amortization expense related to the customer relationships acquired) for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The value of the Company s investment balance has been translated from Mexican Pesos ( MXN ) to U.S. Dollars
( USD ) using the spot rates of MXN 19.54 and MXN 17.38 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company s proportionate share of Vasconia s net income has been translated from MXN to USD using the
average exchange rates of MXN 18.73 and MXN 16.41 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and MXN 17.79 to MXN 18.27 and MXN 14.94 to MXN 16.41 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The
effect of the translation of the Company s investment resulted in a decrease to the investment of $2.5 million and $5.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively (also see Note L). These translation
effects are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Included within prepaid expenses and other current assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are amounts due from Vasconia of $182,000 and $55,000,
respectively. Included within accrued expenses and accounts payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are amounts due to Vasconia of $130,000 and $28,000, respectively.

  A summarized statement of income information for Vasconia in USD and MXN is as follows:  
   
   The Company recorded equity in losses of Vasconia, net of taxes, of $138,000 and $459,000 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively. The Company recorded equity in losses of Vasconia, net of taxes, of $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Due to the requirement to record tax
benefits for foreign currency translation losses through other comprehensive income (loss), with a corresponding adjustment to deferred tax liabilities, equity in losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes deferred
tax expense of $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Equity in earnings for the three and nine month periods ended 2015 include deferred tax expense of $0.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value (based upon Vasconia s quoted stock price) of the Company s investment in
Vasconia was $31.4 million and $35.9 million, respectively. The carrying value of the Company s investment in Vasconia was $22.3 million and $24.7 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company sold its 40% equity interest in GS Internacional S/A ( GSI ), a wholesale
distributor of branded housewares products in Brazil. The Company initially acquired GSI in December 2011 and accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting; however, impairment losses in 2014 reduced the investment balance to
zero. Upon the sale of its equity interest in GSI the Company recognized a net gain of $189,000. This gain is included within Equity in earnings (losses), net of tax, and represents the net consideration received of R$2.3 million (approximately
$567,000) reduced by currency translation losses of $378,000 which were reclassified out of Other comprehensive income (loss).    The Company evaluated the
disclosure requirements of ASC Topic No. 860,  Transfers and Servicing , and determined that at September 30, 2016, the Company did not have a controlling voting interest or variable interest in any of its investments and therefore
continued accounting for the investments using the equity method of accounting.

   NOTE D   INTANGIBLE ASSETS   
 Intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):      
   The Company performed its annual impairment test for its indefinite-lived trade names as of October 1, 2016. The Company
elected to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company s indefinite-lived trade names are less than the carrying values. The Company considered events and circumstances
that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived trade names. Based on the qualitative assessment the Company determined it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the Company s
indefinite-lived trade names are less than the carrying values.     NOTE E   DEBT   
  Credit Agreement     The Company s Credit Agreement,
which expires in January 2019, provides for, among other things, a Revolving Credit Facility commitment totaling $175.0 million ($40.0 million of which is available for multi-currency borrowings) and a Term Loan facility.  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility were $128.7 million and $65.6 million,
respectively, and open letters of credit were $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. At September 30, 2016, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately $43.9 million. The borrowing capacity under the Revolving
Credit Facility depends, in part, on eligible levels of accounts receivable and inventory that fluctuate regularly and certain trademark values based upon periodic appraisals, and may be lower in the first and second quarters when the Company s
inventory level is lower due to seasonality.    The Company s payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by
each of its existing U.S. subsidiaries and will be unconditionally guaranteed by each of its future U.S. subsidiaries. Certain payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are also direct obligations of its foreign subsidiary borrowers
designated as such under the Credit Agreement and, subject to limitations on such guaranties, are guaranteed by the foreign subsidiary borrowers, as well as by the Company. The obligations of the Company under the Revolving Credit Facility and any
hedging arrangements and cash management services and the guarantees by its domestic subsidiaries in respect of those obligations are secured by substantially all of the assets and stock (but in the case of foreign subsidiaries, limited to 65% of
the capital stock in first-tier foreign

subsidiaries and not including the stock of subsidiaries of such first-tier foreign subsidiaries) owned by the Company and the U.S. subsidiary guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. Such
security interests consist of a first-priority lien, subject to certain permitted liens, with respect to the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries pledged as collateral in favor of lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $12.0 million and $35.0 million, respectively, was outstanding under the Term Loan. At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, unamortized debt issuance costs were $179,000 and $621,000. In May 2015 the credit agreement was amended to provide for a $10.0 million prepayment of the Term Loan, if such amount was greater than
the payment that would have been required pursuant to the agreement s original terms (50% of the Company s excess cash flow for the 2015 fiscal year). In April 2016, the Company made a prepayment of $15.2 million in accordance with the
amended terms. In connection therewith, the Company wrote-off debt issuance costs of $0.3 million.    Interest rates on outstanding borrowings at
September 30, 2016 ranged from 2.50% to 5.06%. In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee of 0.375% on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 The Credit Agreement provides for customary restrictions and events of default. Restrictions include limitations on additional indebtedness, acquisitions,
investments and payment of dividends, among other things. Further, the Credit Agreement provides that at any time any Term Loan is outstanding or at any time no Term Loan is outstanding and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less
than $17.5 million and continuing until availability of at least $20.0 million is maintained for three consecutive months, the Company is required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1.00 for each of four consecutive fiscal
quarter periods. The Credit Agreement also provides that when the Term Loan is outstanding, the Company is required to maintain a Senior Leverage Ratio within defined parameters not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending
September 30, 2016; and 3.75 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. For any fiscal quarter of the Company ending on September 30 th , the maximum Senior Leverage Ratio is
increased by an additional 0.25:1.00 in excess of the applicable level otherwise provided.    Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, as of September 30,
2016, the maximum additional permitted indebtedness other than certain subordinated indebtedness was $43.9 million. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2016.  
 In August 2016, the Company amended the Credit Agreement, among other things, to allow the sale of certain accounts receivable by the Company to other
financial institutions (subject to approval of the Credit Agreement s administrative agent) and revise the definition of EBITDA to provide that non-recurring charges shall not exceed $5.0 million during the term of the Credit Agreement (the
previous limit was $2.0 million).     Other Credit Agreements   
 A subsidiary of the Company has a credit facility ( HSBC Facility  or  Short term loan ) with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai
Branch ( HSBC ) for up to RMB 18.0 million ($2.9 million). The HSBC Facility is subject to annual renewal and may be used to fund general working capital needs of the Company s subsidiary which is a trading company in the
People s Republic of China. Borrowings under the HSBC Facility are guaranteed by the Company and are granted at the sole discretion of HSBC. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, borrowings of RMB 787,000 ($118,000) and RMB
1.6 million ($252,000), respectively, were outstanding under the HSBC Facility. Outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2016 carried an interest rate of 5.0%.

   NOTE F   DERIVATIVES   
 The Company is a party to interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of $15.8 million and $20.1 million, at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, to manage interest rate exposure in connection with its variable interest rate borrowings. The hedge periods of these agreements commenced in March 2013 and expire in June 2018 and the notional amounts
amortize over these periods. The interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic No. 815. The effective portion of the fair value gain or loss on these agreements is recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss).   The Company has also entered into certain foreign exchange contracts, primarily to offset the earnings impact related
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with sales and inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate gross notional values of foreign exchange contracts at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 were $20.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively. These foreign exchange contracts have not been designated as hedges as required in order to apply hedge accounting. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded in earnings
immediately.    The fair values of the Company s derivative financial instruments included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets are presented
as follows (in thousands):      
   The fair values of the derivatives have been obtained from the counterparties to the agreements and were based on Level 2

  Option Awards     A summary of the Company s stock
option activity and related information for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:      
   The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that would have been received by
the option holders had all option holders exercised their stock options on September 30, 2016. The intrinsic value is calculated for each in-the-money stock option as the difference between the closing price of the Company s common stock
on September 30, 2016 and the exercise price.    The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of a stock option that is exercised is calculated at the date of exercise.  
 Total unrecognized stock option compensation expense at September 30, 2016, before the effect of income taxes, was $1.8 million and is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

  The Company recognized total stock compensation expense of $0.8 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, of which $0.5 million represents stock option compensation expense and $0.3 million represents restricted stock and performance based compensation expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company
recognized total stock compensation expense of $2.3 million, of which $1.7 million represents stock option compensation expense, $0.5 million represents restricted stock and performance based compensation expense and $53,000 represents stock awards
granted in 2015.    At September 30, 2016, there were 410,504 shares available for awards that could be granted under the Company s Amended and
Restated 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan.     NOTE H   INCOME PER COMMON SHARE          
 Basic income per common share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding
during the relevant period. Diluted income per common share adjusts net income and basic income per common share for the effect of all potentially dilutive shares of the Company s common stock. The calculations of basic and diluted income per
common share for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:      
   The computation of diluted income per common share for the three September 30, 2016 excludes options to purchase 523,375
shares. The computation of diluted income per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 excludes options to purchase 1,543,387 shares and 89,164 restricted shares. The computation of diluted income per common share for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015 excludes options to purchase 682,900 shares and 1,732,076 shares, respectively. These shares were excluded due to their antidilutive effects.  
  NOTE I   INCOME TAXES     On a quarterly basis, the
Company evaluates its tax positions and revises its estimates accordingly. The estimated value of the Company s uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2016 is a gross liability of tax and interest of $172,000. The Company believes that
$70,000 of its tax positions will be resolved within the next twelve months.    The Company has identified the following jurisdictions as  major 
tax jurisdictions: U.S. Federal, California, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and the United Kingdom. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal income tax examinations for the years prior to 2014. At September 30, 2016, the periods
subject to examination for the Company s major state jurisdictions are the years ended 2012 through 2015.

  The Company s policy for recording interest and penalties is to record such items as a component of
income taxes. Interest and penalties were not material to the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
 The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 14.9% as compared to 31.6% for the 2015 period. The Company s
effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects the enactment of lower corporate income tax rates in the United Kingdom, from 18% to 17%, effective April 1, 2020, as well as a lower blended state income tax rate as compared
to the prior year.     NOTE J   BUSINESS SEGMENTS   
 The Company operates in three reportable business segments: U.S. Wholesale, International and Retail Direct. The U.S. Wholesale segment is the Company s
primary domestic business that designs, markets and distributes its products to retailers and distributors. The International segment consists of certain business operations conducted outside the U.S. The Retail Direct segment is where the Company
markets and sells a limited selection of its products directly to consumers through its Pfaltzgraff, Mikasa, Fred and Friends, Built NY and Lifetime Sterling internet websites.  
 The Company has segmented its operations to reflect the manner in which management reviews and evaluates the results of its operations. While the three
segments distribute similar products, the segments are distinct due to the different methods the Company uses to sell, market and distribute the products. Management evaluates the performance of the U.S. Wholesale, International and Retail Direct
segments based on net sales and income (loss) from operations. Such measures give recognition to specifically identifiable operating costs such as cost of sales, distribution expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Certain general
and administrative expenses, such as senior executive salaries and benefits, stock compensation, director fees and accounting, legal and consulting fees, are not allocated to the specific segments and are reflected as unallocated corporate expenses.

  NOTE K     CONTINGENCIES     Wallace Silversmiths
de Puerto Rico, Ltd. ( WSPR ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, operates a manufacturing facility in San Germ n, Puerto Rico that is leased from the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company ( PRIDCO ). In March
2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the  EPA ) announced that the San Germ n Ground Water Contamination site in Puerto Rico (the  Site ) had been added to the Superfund National Priorities List due to
contamination present in the local drinking water supply.    In May 2008, WSPR received from the EPA a Notice of Potential Liability and Request for
Information Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sections 9607(a) and 9604(e) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ( CERCLA ). In July 2011, WSPR received a letter from the EPA requesting access to the property
that it leases from PRIDCO to conduct an environmental investigation, and the Company granted such access. In February 2013, the EPA requested access to conduct a further environmental investigation at the property. PRIDCO agreed to such access
and the Company consented. EPA conducted a further investigation during 2013 and, in April 2015, notified the Company and PRIDCO that the results from vapor intrusion sampling may warrant implementation of measures to mitigate potential exposure to
sub-slab soil gas. The Company reviewed the information provided by the EPA and requested that PRIDCO, as the property owner, find and implement a solution acceptable to the EPA. While WSPR did not cause the sub-surface condition that resulted
in the potential for vapor intrusion, in order to protect the health of its employees and continue its business operations, it has nevertheless implemented corrective action measures to prevent vapor intrusion such as sealing floors of the building
and conducting periodic air monitoring to address potential exposure. On August 13, 2015, the EPA released its remedial investigation and feasibility study ( RI/FS ) for the Site. On December 11, 2015, the EPA issued the Record
of Decision ( ROD ) for OU-1, electing to implement its preferred remedy which consists of soil vapor extraction and dual-phase extraction/ in-situ  treatment. This selected remedy includes soil vapor extraction ( SVE ) to
address soil (vadose zone) source areas at the Site, impermeable cover as necessary for the implementation of SVE, dual phase extraction in the shallow saprolite zone, and  in-situ  treatment as needed to address residual sources. The
EPA s estimated capital cost for its selected remedy is $7.3 million. The EPA also designated a second operable unit under which the EPA will conduct further investigations to determine the nature and extent of groundwater contamination, as
well as a determination by EPA on the necessity of any further response actions to address groundwater contamination. WSPR never used the primary contaminant of concern and did not take up its tenancy at the Site until after the EPA had discovered
the contamination in the local water supply. The EPA has also issued notices of potential liability to a number of other entities affiliated with the Site, which used the contaminants of concern.  
 Accordingly, based on the above uncertainties and variables, it is not possible at this time for the Company to estimate its share of liability, if any,
related to this matter. However, in the event of one or more adverse determinations related to this matter, it is possible that the ultimate liability resulting from this matter and the impact on the Company s results of operations could be
material.

     Review Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lifetime Brands, Inc.:  
 We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of Lifetime Brands, Inc. as of September 30, 2016, and the related condensed consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.    We conducted our review in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.    Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the condensed consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of Lifetime Brands, Inc. as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholder s equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein) and we expressed an
unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements in our report dated March 14, 2016. We did not audit the consolidated financial statements of Grupo Vasconia, S.A.B. and Subsidiaries (a corporation in which the Company has a
30% interest), which statements have been audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Grupo Vasconia, S.A.B. and
Subsidiaries, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. In the consolidated financial statements, the Company s investment in Grupo Vasconia, S.A.B. and Subsidiaries is stated at $24.7 million at December 31, 2015, and the
Company s equity in the net income of Grupo Vasconia, S.A.B. and Subsidiaries is stated at $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. In our opinion, the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Lifetime Brands, Inc. as
of December 31, 2015, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

  ABOUT THE COMPANY     The Company designs, sources and sells
branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home. During the first quarter of 2016 the Company realigned its U.S. Wholesale product categories. The realignment included grouping certain pantryware products and spice racks within
the Kitchenware product category. The Company s realigned product categories include two categories of products used to prepare, serve and consume foods, Kitchenware (kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, cutting boards, shears, cookware,
pantryware, spice racks, and bakeware) and Tableware (dinnerware, stemware, flatware and giftware); and one category, Home Solutions, which comprises other products used in the home (thermal beverageware, food storage, neoprene travel products and
home d cor). In 2015, with categories recast to conform with the current period presentation, Kitchenware products and Tableware products accounted for approximately 92% of the Company s U.S. Wholesale net sales and 90% of the
Company s consolidated net sales.    At the heart of the Company is a culture of innovation. The Company employs over 120 artists, engineers,
industrial designers and graphics specialists, who create new products, packaging and merchandising concepts. The Company brought over 5,500 new or redesigned products to market in 2015 and expects to introduce approximately 5,500 new or redesigned
products in 2016. Historically, new products generally reach their peak sales in 12 to 18 months following introduction.    The Company markets several
product lines within each of its product categories and under most of the Company s brands, primarily targeting moderate price points through virtually every major level of trade. The Company believes it possesses certain competitive advantages
based on its brands, its emphasis on innovation and new product development and its sourcing capabilities. The Company owns or licenses a number of leading brands in its industry including
Farberware   , Mikasa   , KitchenAid   , KitchenCraft   , Pfaltzgraff   , Sabatier   ,
Kamenstein   , masterclass   , Fred   , Towle    and Built NY   . Historically, the Company s sales growth has come from expanding product offerings within its product categories, by
developing existing brands, acquiring new brands and establishing new product categories. Key factors in the Company s growth strategy have been the selective use and management of the Company s brands and the Company s ability to
provide a stream of new products and designs. The Company has also significantly expanded its international footprint through acquisitions of businesses which own or license complementary brands in markets outside the United States.  
 In 2016, the Company further expanded its brand portfolio through the acquisition of brands and certain other assets of Wilton Armetale and the acquisition of
certain assets of the Kitchen division of Focus Products Group, LLC. The Focus Products Group acquisition included kitchenware and bakeware products marketed under the Amco Houseworks   ,
Chicago  Metallic and Swing-A-Way    brands.    In October 2016 the Company acquired the Copco    product line, which specializes in thermal and hydration beverageware, tea kettles and kitchen organization products, from Wilton Industries, Inc.  
  BUSINESS SEGMENTS     The Company operates in three
reportable segments: U.S. Wholesale, International and Retail Direct. The U.S. Wholesale segment, is the Company s primary domestic business that designs, markets and distributes its products to retailers and distributors. The International
segment consists of certain business operations conducted outside the U.S. The Retail Direct segment is that in which the Company markets and sells a limited selection of its products directly to consumers through its Pfaltzgraff, Mikasa, Fred and
Friends, Built NY and Lifetime Sterling internet websites. The Company has segmented its operations to reflect the manner in which management reviews and evaluates its results of operations.

   EQUITY INVESTMENTS   
 The Company owns approximately 30% of the outstanding capital stock of Grupo Vasconia, S.A.B. ( Vasconia ), an integrated manufacturer of aluminum
products and one of Mexico s largest housewares companies. Shares of Vasconia s capital stock are traded on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, the Mexican Stock Exchange. The Quotation Key is VASCONI.  
 The Company accounts for its investment in Vasconia using the equity method of accounting and has recorded its proportionate share of Vasconia s net
income, net of taxes, as equity in earnings in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. Pursuant to a Shares Subscription Agreement (the  Agreement ), the Company may designate four persons to be nominated as members of
Vasconia s Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2016, Vasconia s Board of Directors is comprised of ten members of whom the Company has designated three members.  
 During the second quarter of 2016 the Company sold its 40% equity interest in GS Internacional S/A ( GSI ), a wholesale distributor of branded
housewares products in Brazil. The Company initially acquired GSI in December 2011 and accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting; however, impairment losses recognized in 2014 reduced the value of the investment to zero.
Upon the sale of its equity interest in GSI the Company recognized a net gain of $189,000 which is included within Equity in earnings (losses), net of tax.  
  SEASONALITY     The Company s business and working
capital needs are highly seasonal, with a majority of sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters. In 2015 and 2014, net sales for the third and fourth quarters accounted for 59% and 60% of total annual net sales, respectively. In anticipation
of the pre-holiday shipping season, inventory levels increase primarily in the June through October time period. Consistent with the seasonality of the Company s net sales and inventory levels, the Company also experiences seasonality in its
inventory turnover and turnover days from one quarter to the next.     RESTRUCTURING   
 In 2015 the Company commenced an in-depth review of its U.S. Wholesale business segment, which included the evaluation of the segment s efficiency and
effectiveness, with the objective of developing a plan to restructure its operations as appropriate. During 2016 the Company expanded this restructuring plan to focus on specific actions required to achieve the plan s objectives. The
restructuring plan included the realignment of product categories to best achieve the Company s strategic plan and implementation of cost reduction initiatives. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $1.7
million of restructuring expense. The Company expects to incur $606,000 of additional severance charges in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the U.S. Wholesale restructuring.

   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   
  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED   
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2015      Net Sales   
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $170.1 million, an increase of $6.9 million, or 4.2%, as compared to net sales of $163.2
million for the corresponding period in 2015.    Net sales for the U.S. Wholesale segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $139.6
million, an increase of $9.0 million, or 6.9%, as compared to net sales of $130.6 million for the corresponding period in 2015. As a result of the Company s realignment of the product categories within the U.S. Wholesale segment, previous
periods presented for the U.S. Wholesale segment product categories have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.    Net sales for the
U.S. Wholesale segment s Kitchenware product category were $75.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 4.5%, as compared to $78.5 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in
the U.S. Wholesale segment s Kitchenware product category sales was attributable to a decrease in cutlery sales; and cookware sales, in part, due to timing. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in pantryware warehouse club programs
and an increase in sales from a cross-divisional program at a major retailer.    Net sales for the U.S. Wholesale segment s Tableware product category
were $48.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $8.1 million, or 20.0%, as compared to $40.5 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was attributable to dinnerware and flatware warehouse club
program sales.    Net sales for the U.S. Wholesale segment s Home Solutions product category were $16.0 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, an increase of $4.4 million, or 37.9%, as compared to $11.6 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase reflects new home d cor programs and the timing of drug store chain programs. The increase also
reflects the new program launch for the Built NY line.    Net sales for the International segment were $26.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 7.3%, as compared to net sales of $28.8 million for the corresponding period in 2015. In constant currency, net sales increased approximately 4.8%. The increase, in local currencies, was
primarily due to kitchenware sales to on-line retailers and export sales and, to a lesser extent, tableware sales.    Net sales for the Retail Direct
segment were $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     Gross margin   
 Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $58.3 million, or 34.3%, as compared to $57.0 million, or 34.9%, for the corresponding
period in 2015.    Gross margin for the U.S. Wholesale segment was $47.1 million, or 33.8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $44.8 million, or 34.3%, for the corresponding period in 2015. Gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on a number of factors, including product and customer mix. The decrease reflects a change in product mix and shift in product
category growth.    Gross margin for the International segment was $8.7 million, or 32.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $9.6 million, or 33.2%, for the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in margin is the result of the weakened British pound and, to a lesser extent, customer mix for kitchenware products.  
 Gross margin for the Retail Direct segment was $2.5 million, or 66.9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2.6 million, or
69.2%, for the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in gross margin in the Retail Direct segment reflects a change in product mix.

   Distribution expenses   
 Distribution expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $14.5 million as compared to $13.3 million for the corresponding period in 2015.
In September 2016, the Company identified and corrected an error in the accumulated depreciation balance relating to certain leasehold improvements at one of its U.S. warehouses. Accordingly, distribution expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 includes $1.3 million of additional depreciation expense to properly reflect the accumulated depreciation balance of these assets as of September 30, 2016. Excluding this additional depreciation expense, distribution
expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 8.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for the U.S. Wholesale segment were approximately 7.7% and 7.0% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the additional depreciation expense described above, distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for the U.S. Wholesale segment were approximately 6.7% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. As a percentage of sales shipped from the Company s warehouses, distribution expenses for the U.S. Wholesale segment were 8.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 8.4% for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease reflects the effect of an increase in sales shipped from the Company s warehouses.    Distribution expenses as a
percentage of net sales for the International segment were approximately 9.7% and 10.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Distribution expenses as a percentage of sales shipped from the Company s U.K.
warehouses were 12.2% and 12.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The improvement reflects a reduction in freight rates.  
 Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for the Retail Direct segment were approximately 31.6% and 32.6% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was from lower freight-out expenses due to fewer product breakage replacements.     Selling,
general and administrative expenses     Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $33.0
million, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 2.4%, as compared to $33.8 million for the corresponding period in 2015.    Selling, general and administrative
expenses for the U.S. Wholesale segment were $22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $22.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The 2016 period reflects a reduction in headcount. As a
percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 15.8% and 16.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 for the International segment were $5.0 million, a decrease of
$1.1 million, from $6.1 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in the 2016 quarter was due to foreign currency transaction gains resulting from the Company s hedging activity and the effect of foreign currency translation as
a result of the weakened British pound.    Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Retail Direct segment were $1.5 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a decrease in headcount and a reduction in selling expenses.  
 Unallocated corporate expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $4.5 million as compared to $3.9 million for the corresponding period
in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in acquisition related expenses.

   Interest expense   
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.2 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, from $1.5 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease in expense was attributable to a decrease in average borrowings and a decrease in average borrowing rate due to Term Loan repayments.  
  Income tax provision     Income tax provision for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.0 million as compared to $2.7 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 31.0% as compared to 33.0% for
the corresponding 2015 period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflects the enactment of lower corporate income tax rates in the United Kingdom, from 18% to 17%, effective April 1, 2020 as well as a
lower blended state income tax rate as compared to the prior year.     Equity in losses   
 Equity in losses of Vasconia, net of taxes, was $138,000, net of tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $459,000, net of tax,
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Equity in losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include deferred tax expense of $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, due to the requirement to record tax
benefits for foreign currency translation losses through other comprehensive income (loss), with a corresponding adjustment to deferred tax liabilities. Vasconia reported income from operations of $0.6 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, as compared to a $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in income from operations is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume and margin in Vasconia s aluminum business.

million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 0.9%, as compared to net sales of $311.7 million for the corresponding period in 2015. As a result of the Company s realignment of its product categories within the U.S. Wholesale segment, previous
periods presented for the U.S. Wholesale segment product categories have been recast to conform to the current period presentation.    Net sales for the
U.S. Wholesale s Kitchenware product category were $189.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $7.8 million, or 4.0%, as compared to $197.0 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in the
U.S. Wholesale s Kitchenware product category was primarily attributable to a decrease in cutlery sales and a decrease in cookware sales, in part, due to timing. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales from a cross-divisional
program at a major retailer.    Net sales for the U.S. Wholesale s Tableware product category were $95.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, an increase of $6.4 million, or 7.2%, as compared to $88.6 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase was attributable to dinnerware and glassware warehouse club program sales.  
 Net sales for the U.S. Wholesale s Home Solutions product category were $30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of
$4.3 million, or 16.5%, as compared to $26.1 million for the corresponding period in 2015. This increase reflects an increase in home d cor sales, on timing of a drug store program and new programs at certain retailers, and a new program
launch for the Built NY line.    Net sales for the International segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $72.0 million, a decrease of
$4.6 million, as compared to net sales of $76.6 million for the corresponding period in 2015. In local currency, net sales increased approximately 1.4%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in kitchenware sales to on-line retailers and
export sales, partially offset by a decline in tableware sales with certain customers.    Net sales for the Retail Direct segment for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were $12.5 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 6.7%, as compared to $13.4 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales from the Mikasa    Internet website.     Gross margin   
 Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $141.9 million, or 35.5%, as compared to $145.4 million, or 36.2%, for the corresponding
period in 2015.    Gross margin for the U.S. Wholesale segment was $108.9 million, or 34.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $110.4 million, or 35.4%, for the corresponding period in 2015. Gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on a number of factors, including product and customer mix. The decrease reflects an increase in customer incentives and a
change in product mix.    Gross margin for the International segment was $24.6 million, or 34.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as
compared to $25.8 million, or 33.7%, for the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in margin is the result of a decrease in tableware promotional activities and change in customer mix.  
 Gross margin for the Retail Direct segment was $8.4 million, or 66.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $9.1 million, or
67.9%, for the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in gross margin in Retail Direct reflects additional costs to reduce shipment breakage and higher royalty expenses.  
  Distribution expenses     Distribution expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 were $40.2 million as compared to $39.4 million for the corresponding period in 2015. In September 2016, the Company identified and corrected an error

2016 includes $1.3 million of additional depreciation expense to properly reflect the accumulated depreciation balance of these assets as of September 30, 2016. Excluding this additional depreciation expense, distribution expenses as a
percentage of net sales were 9.7% and 9.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.    Distribution expenses as a
percentage of net sales for the U.S. Wholesale segment were approximately 9.1% and 8.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the additional depreciation expense described above, distribution expenses as
a percentage of net sales for the U.S. Wholesale segment were approximately 8.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. As a percentage of sales shipped from the Company s warehouses, distribution expenses for the U.S. Wholesale
segment were 9.6% and 9.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease reflects the effect of an increase in sales shipped from the Company s warehouses and a decrease in freight-out expenses due to
carrier rate negotiations.    Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for the International segment were approximately 11.0% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 10.7% for the corresponding period in 2015. As a percentage of sales shipped from the Company s U.K. warehouses, distribution expenses for the International segment were 12.7% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. A decrease in sales shipped from the warehouses offset a decrease in freight-out expenses due to a change in customer mix.  
 Distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales for the Retail Direct segment were approximately 30.4% and 31.6% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was from lower freight-out expenses due to fewer product breakage replacements.     Selling,
general and administrative expenses     Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $94.7 million,

headcount and unrealized foreign currency translation gains, partially offset by an increase in selling related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 20.0% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to 20.8% for the corresponding period in 2015.    Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 for the International segment were $15.7 million, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 18.2%, as compared to $19.2 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a charge of
approximately $1.5 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration attributable to the Kitchen Craft acquisition. The decrease in the 2016 quarter was due to foreign currency transaction gains resulting from the
Company s hedging activity and the effect of foreign currency translation as a result of the weakened British pound.    Selling, general and
administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for the Retail Direct segment were $4.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a decrease in headcount and a reduction
in selling expenses.    Unallocated corporate expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $11.6 million and $9.6 million,
respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in acquisition related fees and the reimbursement of expenses incurred for an acquisition not completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

  Income tax provision     The income tax provision for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $0.2 million as compared to $0.7 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 14.9% as compared to 31.6%
for the 2015 period. The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects the enactment of lower corporate income tax rates in the United Kingdom, from 18% to 17%, effective April 1, 2020, as well as
a lower blended state income tax rate as compared to the prior year.     Equity in earnings (losses)   
 Equity in losses of Vasconia, net of taxes, was $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Equity
in losses includes a deferred tax expense of $0.5 million and $1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to the requirement to record tax benefits for foreign currency translation losses through
other comprehensive income (loss), with a corresponding adjustment to deferred tax liabilities. Vasconia reported income from operations of $3.6 million and $8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
net income of $0.5 million and $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in income from operations is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume and margin in Vasconia s aluminum
business.    As described above, the Company sold its 40% equity interest in GSI during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Upon the sale of its
equity interest in GSI the Company recognized a net gain of $189,000. This gain represents the net consideration received of R$2.3 million (approximately $567,000) reduced by currency translation losses of $378,000 reclassified out of Other
comprehensive income (loss).

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
 The Company s principal sources of cash to fund liquidity needs are: (i) cash provided by operating activities and (ii) borrowings available
under its revolving credit facility. The Company s primary uses of funds consist of working capital requirements, capital expenditures and payments of principal and interest on its debt.  
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $5.8 million compared to $7.1 million at December 31, 2015. Working capital was
$206.2 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $152.0 million at December 31, 2015. Liquidity, which includes cash and cash equivalents and availability under its credit facilities (subject to the financial covenants of the Credit
Agreement), was $49.8 million.    Inventory, a large component of the Company s working capital, is expected to fluctuate from period to period, with
inventory levels higher primarily in the June through October time period. The Company also expects inventory turnover to fluctuate from period to period based on product and customer mix. Certain product categories have lower inventory turnover
rates as a result of minimum order quantities from the Company s vendors or customer replenishment needs. Certain other product categories experience higher inventory turns due to lower minimum order quantities or trending sale demands. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016 inventory turnover was 2.8 times, or 132 days, as compared to 2.6 times, or 142 days, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in turnover and decrease in turnover days is, in part,
the result of a reduction in average inventory in the U.S. Wholesale segment due to SKU rationalization and inventory management. This was partially offset by an increase in average inventory in the International segment due to a change in strategy
to accommodate the replenishment of certain high volume items with certain retailers.    The Company s Credit Agreement, which expires in January 2019,
provides for, among other things, a Revolving Credit Facility commitment totaling $175.0 million ($40.0 million of which is available for multi-currency borrowings) and a Term Loan facility.  
 At September 30, 2016, borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility were $128.7 million and open letters of credit were $2.4 million. At
September 30, 2016, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately $43.9 million. The borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility depends, in part, on eligible levels of accounts receivable and inventory that
fluctuate regularly and certain trademark values based upon periodic appraisals, and may be lower in the first and second quarters when the Company s inventory level is lower due to seasonality.  
 The Company s payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by each of its existing U.S. subsidiaries and will
be unconditionally guaranteed by each of its future U.S. subsidiaries. Certain payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are also direct obligations of its foreign subsidiary borrowers designated as such under the Credit Agreement and,
subject to limitations on such guaranties, are guaranteed by the foreign subsidiary borrowers, as well as by the Company. The obligations of the Company under the Revolving Credit Facility and any hedging arrangements and cash management services
and the guarantees by its domestic subsidiaries in respect of those obligations are secured by substantially all of the assets and stock (but in the case of foreign subsidiaries, limited to 65% of the capital stock in first-tier foreign subsidiaries
and not including the stock of subsidiaries of such first-tier foreign subsidiaries) owned by the Company and the U.S. subsidiary guarantors, subject to certain exceptions. Such security interests consist of a first-priority lien, subject to certain
permitted liens, with respect to the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries pledged as collateral in favor of lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $12.0 million and $35.0 million, respectively, were outstanding under the Term Loan. At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, unamortized debt issuance costs were $179,000 and $621,000, respectively.    Interest rates on
outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2016 ranged from 2.50% to 5.06%. In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee of 0.375% on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 The Credit Agreement provides for customary restrictions and events of default. Restrictions include limitations on additional indebtedness, acquisitions,
investments and payment of dividends, among other things. Further, the Credit Agreement provides that at any time any Term Loan is outstanding or at any time no Term Loan is outstanding and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less
than $17.5 million and continuing until  
      - 34 -  

Table of Contents  

availability of at least $20.0 million is maintained for three consecutive months, the Company is required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1.00 for each of four
consecutive fiscal quarter periods. The Credit Agreement also provides that when the Term Loan is outstanding, the Company is required to maintain a Senior Leverage Ratio within defined parameters not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter
ending June 30 and September 30, 2016; and 3.75 to 1.00 for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. For any fiscal quarter of the Company ending on September 30 th , the maximum Senior
Leverage Ratio is increased by an additional 0.25:1.00 in excess of the applicable level otherwise provided.    As of September 30, 2016, the
Company s Senior Leverage Ratio was 3.11 to 1.00.    Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, as of September 30, 2016 the maximum additional
permitted indebtedness other than certain subordinated indebtedness was $43.9 million. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2016.  
  Covenant Calculations     Consolidated EBITDA, as provided
below, is used in the calculation of covenants provided for in the Company s Credit Agreement. The following is the Company s Consolidated EBITDA for the last four fiscal quarters:  
   
   Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $2.0 million.

   Non-GAAP financial measure   
 Consolidated EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The following is
a reconciliation of the net income, as reported, to Consolidated EBITDA, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:      
    Other Credit Agreements   
 A subsidiary of the Company has a credit facility ( HSBC Facility  or  Short term loan ) with HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai
Branch ( HSBC ) for up to RMB 18.0 million ($2.9 million). The HSBC Facility is subject to annual renewal and may be used to fund general working capital needs of the subsidiary which is a trading company in the People s Republic
of China. Borrowings under the HSBC Facility are guaranteed by the Company and are granted at the sole discretion of HSBC. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, borrowings of RMB 787,000 ($118,000) and RMB 1.6 million
($252,000), respectively, were outstanding under the HSBC Facility. Outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2016 carried an interest rate of 5.0%.  
  Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement     In order to
reduce accounts receivable balances and improve cash flows, on September 30, 2016 the Company entered into an uncommitted Receivables Purchase Agreement among the Company and HSBC Bank USA, National Association ( HSBC ), as Purchaser
(the  Receivables Purchase Agreement ). Under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the Company may offer to sell certain eligible accounts receivable (the  Receivables ) to HSBC, which may accept such offer, and purchase the
offered Receivables. Under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, following each purchase of Receivables, the outstanding aggregate purchased Receivables shall not exceed $25.0 million. HSBC will assume credit risk of the Receivables sold and the
Company will be responsible for all non-credit risk matters. The Company will service the Receivables, and as such servicer, collect and otherwise enforce the Receivables on behalf of HSBC. The term of the agreement is for 364 days and shall
automatically be extended for annual successive terms unless terminated. Either party may terminate the agreement at any time upon sixty days  prior written notice to the other party. The Company did not sell any Receivables pursuant to this
agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company sold $16.1 million of Receivables pursuant to this agreement.  
  Derivatives     The Company is a party to interest rate swap
agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $15.8 million to manage interest rate exposure in connection with its variable interest rate borrowings. The hedge periods in these agreements commenced in March 2013 and will expire in September 2018,
and the notional amounts amortize over this period. The hedge provides for a fixed payment of interest at an annual rate of 1.05% in exchange for the Adjusted LIBO Rate.  
 The Company has also entered into certain foreign exchange contracts, to primarily offset the earnings impact related to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates associated with sales and inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign exchange contracts have not been designated as hedges as required in order to apply hedge accounting. The changes in the fair value of
these contracts are recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

   Operating activities   
 Net cash used in operating activities was $30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $11.4 million for the corresponding
2015 period. The change in operating cash flow was primarily due to the timing of the collection of receivables in the current period as compared to the 2015 period and a decrease in payments of accrued expenses and accounts payable in the 2016
period, as compared to the 2015 period.     Investing activities   
 Net cash used in investing activities was $10.8 million and $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2016
investing activity includes the Company s acquisition of inventory and intangibles from Focus Products Group International, LLC and the acquisition of the Wilton Armetale    trade name.
    Financing activities     Net cash provided by financing
activities was $40.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $17.4 million for the corresponding 2015 period. The change in financing activities was attributable to the change in borrowings under the Company s
Revolving Credit Facility and the prepayment of borrowings under the Company s Term Loan.

     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
 There were no material changes in market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates from the information provided in Item 7A
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
    Item 4. Controls and Procedures       

( a)  
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       The Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer of the Company (its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) have concluded, based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2016, that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed by it under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)  
  Changes in Internal Controls       There were no changes in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
  PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
 Wallace Silversmiths de Puerto Rico, Ltd. ( WSPR ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, operates a manufacturing facility in San Germ n,
Puerto Rico that is leased from the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company ( PRIDCO ). In March 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the  EPA ) announced that the San Germ n Ground Water
Contamination site in Puerto Rico (the  Site ) had been added to the Superfund National Priorities List due to contamination present in the local drinking water supply.  
 In May 2008, WSPR received from the EPA a Notice of Potential Liability and Request for Information Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sections 9607(a) and 9604(e) of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ( CERCLA ). In July 2011, WSPR received a letter from the EPA requesting access to the property that it leases from PRIDCO to conduct an environmental investigation, and
the Company granted such access. In February 2013, the EPA requested access to conduct a further environmental investigation at the property. PRIDCO agreed to such access and the Company consented. EPA conducted a further investigation during
2013 and, in April 2015, notified the Company and PRIDCO that the results from vapor intrusion sampling may warrant implementation of measures to mitigate potential exposure to sub-slab soil gas. The Company reviewed the information provided by
the EPA and requested that PRIDCO, as the property owner, find and implement a solution acceptable to the EPA. While WSPR did not cause the sub-surface condition that resulted in the potential for vapor intrusion, in order to protect the health of
its employees and continue its business operations, it has nevertheless implemented corrective action measures to prevent vapor intrusion such as sealing floors of the building and conducting periodic air monitoring to address potential exposure. On
August 13, 2015, the EPA released its remedial investigation and feasibility study ( RI/FS ) for the Site. On December 11, 2015, the EPA issued the Record of Decision ( ROD ) for OU-1, electing to implement its
preferred remedy which consists of soil vapor extraction and dual-phase extraction/ in-situ  treatment. This selected remedy includes soil vapor extraction ( SVE ) to address soil (vadose zone) source areas at the Site, impermeable
cover as necessary for the implementation of SVE, dual phase extraction in the shallow saprolite zone, and  in-situ  treatment as needed to address residual sources. The EPA s estimated capital cost for its selected remedy is $7.3 million.
The EPA also designated a second operable unit under which the EPA will conduct further investigations to determine the  
      - 38 -  

Table of Contents  

nature and extent of groundwater contamination, as well as a determination by EPA on the necessity of any further response actions to address groundwater contamination. WSPR never used the
primary contaminant of concern and did not take up its tenancy at the Site until after the EPA had discovered the contamination in the local water supply. The EPA has also issued notices of potential liability to a number of other entities
affiliated with the Site, which used the contaminants of concern.    Accordingly, based on the above uncertainties and variables, it is not possible at this
time for the Company to estimate its share of liability, if any, related to this matter. However, in the event of one or more adverse determinations related to this matter, it is possible that the ultimate liability resulting from this matter and
the impact on the Company s results of operations could be material.    The Company is, from time to time, involved in other legal proceedings. The
Company believes that other current litigation is routine in nature and incidental to the conduct of the Company s business and that none such litigation, individually or collectively, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.       Item 1A. Risk Factors   
 The following is an update to the corresponding risk factor set forth in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as modified below, there
have been no other material changes in the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in the Company s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
   The Company s business may be materially adversely affected by market conditions and by global and economic conditions and other factors beyond its
control.      The Company s performance is affected by general economic factors, the strength of retail economies and political conditions that
are beyond its control. Retail economies are impacted by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry, which in turn, are affected by general economic factors. These general economic factors include, among other factors:

recession, inflation, deflation, unemployment and other factors adversely affecting consumer spending patterns generally;        

conditions affecting the retail environment for the home and other matters that influence consumer spending in the home retail industry specifically;    

conditions affecting the housing markets;        

consumer credit availability and consumer debt levels;        

material input costs, including fuel and energy costs and labor cost inflation;        

foreign currency translation;        

interest rates and the ability to hedge interest rate risks;        

government policies including tax policies relating to value-added taxes, import and export duties and quotas, antidumping regulations and related tariffs, import and export controls and social compliance standards;

the impact of natural disasters, conflicts and terrorist activities;        

unfavorable economic conditions in the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia and elsewhere; and        

unstable economic and political conditions, lack of legal regulation enforcement, civil unrest and political activism, particularly in Asia.    
 The referendum held in the United Kingdom ( U.K. ) on June 23, 2016 resulted in a determination that the U.K. should exit the European Union.
Such an exit from the European Union would be unprecedented and it is unclear, if passed into law, what impact this would have on the U.K. s access to the EU Single Market and on the legal and regulatory environment in which the Company
operates, as well as its effect on the global macroeconomic environment. The Company has two wholly-owned businesses based in the U.K., Kitchen Craft, acquired in 2014, and Creative Tops, acquired in 2011. Net sales attributable to these U.K.
domiciled businesses were $26.0 million and $70.0 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and represent 15.3% and 17.5% of the Company s consolidated net sales for those periods, respectively.
The uncertainty  
      - 39 -  

Table of Contents  

surrounding the terms of the U.K. s exit and its consequences could adversely impact customer and investor confidence, result in additional market volatility, including volatility in the
value of the British pound and European euro and adversely affect the Company s businesses, results of operations, and financial condition.

c. 
 evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of

5. 
 The registrant s other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the

 all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information; and

 any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
