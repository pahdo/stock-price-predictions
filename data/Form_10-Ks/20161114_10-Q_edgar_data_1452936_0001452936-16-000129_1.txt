1.  
    ORGANIZATION 
     KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. (the  Company ) was formed on October 8, 2008 as a Maryland corporation and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.  The Company conducts its business primarily through KBS Strategic Opportunity (BVI) Holdings, Ltd. ( KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI ), a private company limited by shares according to the British Virgin Islands Business Companies Act, 2004, which was incorporated on December 18, 2015 and is authorized to issue a maximum of   50,000   common shares with no par value. Upon incorporation, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI issued one certificate containing   10,000   common shares with no par value to KBS Strategic Opportunity Limited Partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), a Delaware limited partnership formed on December 10, 2008.  The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a   0.1%   partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.  KBS Strategic Opportunity Holdings LLC ( REIT Holdings ), a Delaware limited liability company formed on December 9, 2008, owns the remaining   99.9%   interest in the Operating Partnership and is its sole limited partner.  The Company is the sole member and manager of REIT Holdings. 
  Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, the business of the Company is externally managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (the  Advisor ), an affiliate of the Company, pursuant to an advisory agreement the Company renewed with the Advisor on October 8, 2016 (the  Advisory Agreement ).  The Advisor conducts the Company s operations and manages its portfolio of real estate.  The Advisor owns   20,000   shares of the Company s common stock.  
  On January 8, 2009, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) to offer a minimum of   250,000   shares and a maximum of   140,000,000   shares of common stock for sale to the public (the  Offering ), of which   100,000,000   shares were registered in a primary offering and   40,000,000   shares were registered to be sold under the Company s dividend reinvestment plan.  The SEC declared the Company s registration statement effective on November 20, 2009.  The Company ceased offering shares of common stock in its primary offering on November 14, 2012 and continues to offer shares under its dividend reinvestment plan.   
  The Company sold   56,584,976   shares of common stock in its primary offering for gross offering proceeds of   $561.7 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had sold   5,804,835   shares of common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $  62.3 million  . Also, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had redeemed   5,635,755   shares sold in the Offering for $  69.9 million  .  Additionally, on December 29, 2011 and October 23, 2012, the Company issued   220,994   shares and   55,249   shares of common stock, respectively, for   $2.0 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. 
  On March 2, 2016, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI filed a final prospectus with the Israel Securities Authority for a proposed offering of up to   1,000,000,000   Israeli new Shekels of Series A debentures (the  Debentures ) at an annual interest rate not to exceed   4.25%  . On March 1, 2016, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the institutional tender of the Debentures and accepted application for   842.5 million   Israeli new Shekels. On March 7, 2016, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the public tender of the Debentures and accepted   127.7 million   Israeli new Shekels.  In the aggregate, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI accepted   970.2 million   Israeli new Shekels (approximately   $259.0 million   as of September 30, 2016) in both the institutional and public tenders at an annual interest rate of   4.25%  .  KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI issued the Debentures on March 8, 2016. The terms of the Debentures require principal installment payments equal to   20%   of the face value of the Debentures on March 1st of each year from 2019 to 2023.  
  In connection with the above-referenced offering, on March 8, 2016, the Operating Partnership assigned to KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI all of its interests in the subsidiaries through which the Company indirectly owns all of its real estate and real estate-related investments.  The Operating Partnership owns all of the issued and outstanding equity of KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI.  As a result of these transactions, the Company now holds all of its real estate and real estate-related investments indirectly through KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI.

           2.  
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     There have been no significant changes to the Company s accounting policies since it filed its audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , except for the addition of accounting policies with respect to foreign currency transactions and derivative instruments. For further information about the Company s accounting policies, refer to the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and condensed notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information as contained within the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for audited financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the financial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair and consistent presentation of the results for such periods.  Operating results for the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.   
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, REIT Holdings, the Operating Partnership, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI and their direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, and joint ventures in which the Company has a controlling interest.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.   
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.    
  Foreign Currency Transactions 
  The U.S. dollar is the Company s functional currency.  Transactions denominated in currency other than the Company s functional currency are recorded upon initial recognition at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. After initial recognition, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are remeasured at each reporting date into the foreign currency at the exchange rate on that date. Exchange rate differences, other than those accounted for as hedging transactions, are recognized as foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in the Company s consolidated statements of operations.

Derivative Instruments 
  The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes to hedge its exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates on its variable rate notes payable and enters into derivative instruments such as cross currency swaps, forward contracts, puts or calls for risk management purposes to hedge its exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates of the Israeli new Shekel versus the U.S. dollar.  The Company records these derivative instruments at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Derivative instruments designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of stockholders  equity. The changes in fair value for derivative instruments that are not designated as a hedge or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria are recorded as gain or loss on derivative instruments and included in earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
  Reclassifications  
  Certain amounts in the Company s prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications have not changed the results of operations of the prior period.  
  Segments 
  The Company has invested in non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets. In general, the Company intends to hold its investments in non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets for capital appreciation. Traditional performance metrics of non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets may not be meaningful as these investments are generally non-stabilized and do not provide a consistent stream of interest income or rental revenue. These investments exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics.  These investments typically involve a higher degree of risk and do not provide a constant stream of ongoing cash flows.  As a result, the Company s management views non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets as similar investments. Substantially all of its revenue and net income (loss) is from non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets, and therefore, the Company currently aggregates its operating segments into   one   reportable business segment. 
  Per Share Data 
  Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during such period.  Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock equals basic net income (loss) per share of common stock as there were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
  Distributions declared per share were   $0.094   and   $0.280   during the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $0.095   and   $0.280   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
  Square Footage, Occupancy and Other Measures 
   Any references to square footage, occupancy or annualized base rent are unaudited and outside the scope of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm s review of the Company s financial statements in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Updates 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU No. 2014-09 ).  ASU No. 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue requirements in   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)   and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.  ASU No. 2014-09 does not apply to lease contracts within the scope of   Leases (Topic 840).    ASU No. 2014-09 was to be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied retrospectively, with early application not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU No. 2015-14 ), which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year. Early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date. The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2014-09 on its financial statements. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   (Subtopic 205-40),   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU No. 2014-15 ). The amendments in ASU No. 2014-15 require management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or are available to be issued when applicable) and, if so, provide related disclosures. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU No. 2015-02 ), which amended the existing accounting standards for consolidation under both the variable interest model and the voting model. ASU No. 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. ASU No. 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in ASU No. 2015-02 using: (a) a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption; or (b) by applying the amendments retrospectively. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-02 and re-evaluated its consolidation analysis of its joint ventures, concluding that such adoption did not result in (a) the classification of any entities as VIEs, (b) a consolidation of entities not previously consolidated or (c) a deconsolidation of entities previously consolidated. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU No. 2016-01 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  ASU No. 2016-01 primarily affects accounting for equity investments and financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected.  ASU No. 2016-01 also requires entities to present financial assets and financial liabilities separately, grouped by measurement category and form of financial asset in the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early application is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 to have a significant impact on its financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU No. 2016-02 ).  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-02 change the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets and making targeted changes to lessor accounting. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 is permitted.  The new leases standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to use certain transition relief.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new leases standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)   ( ASU No. 2016-13 ).  ASU No. 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-13 require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.  ASU No. 2016-13 also amends the impairment model for available-for-sale securities.  An entity will recognize an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as a contra-account to the amortized cost basis rather than as a direct reduction of the amortized cost basis of the investment, as is currently required.   ASU No. 2016-13 also requires new disclosures.  For financial assets measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to disclose information about how it developed its allowance for credit losses, including changes in the factors that influenced management s estimate of expected credit losses and the reasons for those changes.  For financing receivables and net investments in leases measured at amortized cost, an entity will be required to further disaggregate the information it currently discloses about the credit quality of these assets by year of the asset s origination for as many as five annual periods. For available for sale securities, an entity will be required to provide a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses and an aging analysis for securities that are past due.  ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-13 on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU No. 2016-15 ).  ASU No. 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-15 provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues, including the following that are or may be relevant to the Company: (a) Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities; (b) Cash payments relating to contingent consideration made soon after an acquisition s consummation date (i.e., approximately three months or less) should be classified as cash outflows for investing activities. Payments made thereafter should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities up to the amount of the original contingent consideration liability. Payments made in excess of the amount of the original contingent consideration liability should be classified as cash outflows for operating activities; (c) Cash payments received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the nature of the loss (or each component loss, if an entity receives a lump-sum settlement);  (d) Relating to distributions received from equity method investments, ASU No. 2016-15 provides an accounting policy election for classifying distributions received from equity method investments. Such amounts can be classified using a (1) cumulative earnings approach, or (2) nature of distribution approach. Under the cumulative earnings approach, an investor would compare the distributions received to its cumulative equity method earnings since inception.  Any distributions received up to the amount of cumulative equity earnings would be considered a return on investment and classified in operating activities. Any excess distributions would be considered a return of investment and classified in investing activities. Alternatively, an investor can choose to classify the distributions based on the nature of activities of the investee that generated the distribution. If the necessary information is subsequently not available for an investee to determine the nature of the activities, the entity should use the cumulative earnings approach for that investee and report a change in accounting principle on a retrospective basis;  (e) In the absence of specific guidance, an entity should classify each separately identifiable cash source and use on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. For cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated, the classification should be based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow.  ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-15 on its financial statements, but does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

Operating Leases 
  Certain of the Company s real estate properties are leased to tenants under operating leases for which the terms and expirations vary.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the leases, excluding options to extend and apartment leases, which have terms that are generally   one   year or less, had remaining terms of up to   11.5   years with a weighted-average remaining term of   3.6   years.  Some of the leases have provisions to extend the lease agreements, options for early termination after paying a specified penalty, rights of first refusal to purchase the property at competitive market rates, and other terms and conditions as negotiated.  The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants.  Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires a security deposit from tenants in the form of a cash deposit and/or a letter of credit.  The amount required as a security deposit varies depending upon the terms of the respective leases and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally are not significant amounts.  Therefore, exposure to credit risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of its security deposit.  Security deposits received in cash and assumed in real estate acquisitions or foreclosures related to tenant leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled   $7.2 million   and   $5.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company recognized deferred rent from tenants of   $2.0 million   and   $3.7 million  , respectively, net of lease incentive amortization.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the cumulative deferred rent receivable balance, including unamortized lease incentive receivables, was   $25.7 million   and   $22.8 million  , respectively, and is included in rents and other receivables on the accompanying balance sheets.  The cumulative deferred rent balance included $  3.3 million   and   $2.8 million   of unamortized lease incentives as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Company records property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the future minimum rental income from the Company s properties, excluding apartment leases,  under non-cancelable operating leases was as follows (in thousands):   

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s commercial real estate properties were leased to approximately   600   tenants over a diverse range of industries and geographic areas. The Company s highest tenant industry concentrations (greater than 10% of annualized base rent) were as follows: 

_____________________ 
   (1)    Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of   September 30, 2016  , adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease s inception through the balance of the lease term.  
  No other tenant industries accounted for more than 10% of annualized base rent.  No material tenant credit issues have been identified at this time.

Geographic Concentration Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s real estate investments in Washington, California and Texas represented   31.7%  ,   15.6%   and   15.5%   of the Company s total assets, respectively.  As a result, the geographic concentration of the Company s portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the Washington, California and Texas real estate markets.  Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect the Company s operating results and its ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
  Property Damage 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , 1800 West Loop suffered physical damages due to floods.  The Company s insurance policy provides coverage for property damage and business interruption subject to a deductible of up to   $100,000   per incident.  Based on management s estimates, the Company recognized an estimated aggregate loss due to damages of   $1.6 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , which was reduced by   $1.5 million   of estimated insurance recoveries related to such damages, which the Company determined were probable of collection. The aggregate net loss due to damages of   $0.1 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was classified as operating, maintenance and management expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and relates to the Company s insurance deductible.

    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
     The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes to hedge its exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate movements.  The primary goal of the Company s risk management practices related to interest rate risk is to prevent changes in interest rates from adversely impacting the Company s ability to achieve its investment return objectives.  The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes. On October 14, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate cap. See Note 14,  Subsequent Events   Financing Subsequent to September 30, 2016   353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan.  
  The Company enters into foreign currency collars to mitigate its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements on its bonds payable outstanding denominated in Israeli new Shekels. The foreign currency collar consists of a purchased call option to buy and a sold put option to sell the Israeli new Shekels. A foreign currency collar guarantees that the exchange rate of the currency will not fluctuate beyond the range of the options  strike prices. 
  The following table summarizes the notional amount and other information related to the Company s foreign currency collars as of September 30, 2016.  The notional amount is an indication of the extent of the Company s involvement in each instrument at that time, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate or market risks (currency in thousands):

The change in fair value of foreign currency collars that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains or losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a   $1.5 million   gain related to the foreign currency collars, which is shown net against   $8.2 million   and   $6.1 million   of foreign currency transaction losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as foreign currency transaction loss, net, respectively.  
   
           9.  
    FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
     Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis.  In addition, the Company is required to measure other non-financial and financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets).  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach.  Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:   
             
    Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;   
                
    Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and   
                
    Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.   
     The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment.  The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company s financial instruments.  Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available and for which markets contain orderly transactions will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments for which markets are inactive or consist of non-orderly trades.  The Company evaluates several factors when determining if a market is inactive or when market transactions are not orderly.  The following is a summary of the methods and assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value: 
  Cash and cash equivalents, rent and other receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities:   These balances approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these items. 
  Real estate loan receivable:   The Company s real estate loan receivable is presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost net of recorded loan loss reserves and not at fair value.  The fair value of real estate loan receivable was estimated using an internal valuation model that considers the expected cash flows for the loans, underlying collateral values (for collateral dependent loans) and estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value, type of collateral and other credit enhancements.  The Company classifies these inputs as Level 3 inputs.

Notes and bonds payable:   The fair values of the Company s notes and bonds payable are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, the Company measures fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach.  The Company classifies these inputs as Level 3 inputs. The Company s bonds issued in Israel are publicly traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange. The Company used the quoted price as of September 30, 2016 for the fair value of its bonds issued in Israel. The Company classifies this input as a Level 1 input. 
  Derivative instruments:   The Company s derivative instruments are presented at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The valuation of these instruments is determined using a proprietary model that utilizes observable inputs.  As such, the Company classifies these inputs as Level 2 inputs.  
  The following were the face values, carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which carrying amounts do not approximate the fair values (in thousands): 

Disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to the Company as of the period end and requires a significant amount of judgment. This has made the estimation of fair values difficult and, therefore, both the actual results and the Company s estimate of value at a future date could be materially different.

    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
     The Advisory Agreement entitles the Advisor to specified fees upon the provision of certain services with regard to the investment of funds in real estate and real estate-related investments and the disposition of real estate and real estate-related investments (including the discounted payoff of non-performing loans) among other services, as well as reimbursement of certain costs incurred by the Advisor in providing services to the Company. The Advisory Agreement may also entitle the Advisor to certain back-end cash flow participation fees. The Company also entered into a fee reimbursement agreement (the  AIP Reimbursement Agreement ) with KBS Capital Markets Group LLC, the dealer manager for the Company s initial public offering (the  Dealer Manager ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to reimburse the Dealer Manager for certain fees and expenses it incurs for administering the Company s participation in the Depository Trust   Clearing Corporation Alternative Investment Product Platform with respect to certain accounts of the Company s investors serviced through the platform.  The Advisor and Dealer Manager also serve as the advisor and dealer manager, respectively, for KBS Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. ( KBS REIT I ), KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. ( KBS REIT II ), KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. ( KBS REIT III ), KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, Inc. ( KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT ), KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, Inc. ( KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II ) and KBS Growth   Income REIT, Inc. ( KBS Growth   Income REIT ). 
  On January 6, 2014, the Company, together with KBS REIT I, KBS REIT II, KBS REIT III, KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT, KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II, the Dealer Manager, the Advisor and other KBS-affiliated entities, entered into an errors and omissions and directors and officers liability insurance program where the lower tiers of coverage are shared. The cost of these lower tiers is allocated by the Advisor and its insurance broker among each of the various entities covered by the plan, and is billed directly to each entity. The allocation of these shared coverage costs is proportionate to the pricing by the insurance marketplace for the first tiers of directors and officers liability coverage purchased individually by each REIT. The Advisor s and the Dealer Manager s portion of the shared lower tiers  cost is proportionate to the respective entities  prior cost for the errors and omissions insurance.  In June 2015, KBS Growth   Income REIT was added to the insurance program at terms similar to those described above. The insurance program was renewed and is effective through June 30, 2017. 
  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, no other business transactions occurred between the Company and these other KBS-sponsored programs.

    INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES 
     As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures were composed of the following (dollars in thousands): 

Investment in National Industrial Portfolio Joint Venture 
  On May 18, 2012, the Company, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a joint venture (the  NIP Joint Venture ) with OCM NIP JV Holdings, L.P. and HC KBS NIP JV, LLC ( HC-KBS ).  The NIP Joint Venture owns   21   industrial properties and a master lease with respect to another industrial property encompassing   10.8 million   square feet.  The Company made an initial capital contribution of   $8.0 million   which represents less than a   5.0%   ownership interest in the NIP Joint Venture as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company has virtually no influence over the NIP Joint Venture s operations, financial policies or decision making.  Accordingly, the Company has accounted for its investment in the NIP Joint Venture under the cost method of accounting.  Income, losses and distributions from the NIP Joint Venture are generally allocated among the members based on their respective equity interests.   
  KBS REIT I, an affiliate of the Advisor, is a member of HC-KBS and has a participation interest in certain future potential profits generated by the NIP Joint Venture.  However, KBS REIT I does not have any equity interest in the NIP Joint Venture.  None of the other joint venture partners are affiliated with the Company or the Advisor. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the book value of the Company s investment in the NIP Joint Venture was   $5.3 million  .  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company did not receive any distributions related to its investment in the NIP Joint Venture.   
  Investment in 110 William Joint Venture 
  On December 23, 2013, the Company, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an agreement with SREF III 110 William JV, LLC (the  110 William JV Partner ) to form a joint venture (the  110 William Joint Venture ).  On May 2, 2014, the 110 William Joint Venture acquired an office property containing   928,157   rentable square feet located on approximately   0.8   acres of land in New York, New York ( 110 William Street ). Each of the Company and the 110 William JV Partner hold a   60%   and   40%   ownership interest in the 110 William Joint Venture, respectively.  The Company exercises significant influence over the operations, financial policies and decision making with respect to the 110 William Joint Venture but significant decisions require approval from both members.  Accordingly, the Company has accounted for its investment in the 110 William Joint Venture under the equity method of accounting.  Income, losses, contributions and distributions are generally allocated based on the members  respective equity interests.    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the book value of the Company s investment in the 110 William Joint Venture was   $70.8 million   and   $69.1 million  , respectively, which includes   $1.5 million   of unamortized acquisition fees and expenses incurred directly by the Company.

12. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
  The Company acquired   one   office portfolio and   one   office property during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , which were accounted for as business combinations. The following unaudited pro forma information for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 has been prepared to give effect to the acquisition of the Westpark Portfolio and 353 Sacramento as if the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2015.  This pro forma information does not purport to represent what the actual results of operations of the Company would have been had the acquisitions occurred on this date, nor does it purport to predict the results of operations for future periods (in thousands).  

The unaudited pro forma information for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was adjusted to exclude   $2.0 million   and   $3.5 million   of acquisition costs related to the Westpark Portfolio and 353 Sacramento incurred by the Company in 2016, respectively.  
   
           13.  
    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
     Economic Dependency 
  The Company is dependent on the Advisor for certain services that are essential to the Company, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, origination, acquisition and disposition of investments; management of the daily operations of the Company s investment portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities.  In the event that the Advisor is unable to provide these services, the Company will be required to obtain such services from other sources.     
  Environmental  
  As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments.  Although there can be no assurance, the Company is not aware of any environmental liability that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations as of   September 30, 2016  .  However, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, the uses and conditions of properties in the vicinity of the Company s properties, the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the Company is unaware with respect to the properties could result in future environmental liabilities.  
  Legal Matters 
  From time to time, the Company is a party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business.  Management is not aware of any legal proceedings of which the outcome is probable or reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition, which would require accrual or disclosure of the contingency and the possible range of loss.  Additionally, the Company has not recorded any loss contingencies related to legal proceedings in which the potential loss is deemed to be remote.

  Real Estate Related Investment Subsequent to September 30, 2016 
  Battery Point Series B Preferred Units 
  On October 28, 2016, the Company, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a purchase agreement to purchase up to an aggregate of   25,000   units of Series B Preferred Units (the  Preferred Units ) of Battery Point Trust LLC ( Battery Point ), over a six-month period at a per-unit price of   $1,000  , resulting in an aggregate investment of   $25.0 million  . On October 28, 2016, the Company purchased an initial   5,000   Preferred Units, net of an equity commitment fee of   $0.6 million  , for a net payment of   $4.4 million  . The Preferred Units are entitled to the payment of quarterly distributions at the following annual rates:   7.0%   for the period commencing October 28, 2016 through April 28, 2017;   9.0%   for the period commencing April 29, 2017 through April 28, 2018; and   12.0%   for the period commencing April 29, 2018 through October 28, 2019. The Company may be required to purchase additional Preferred Units no more frequently than once a month during the period beginning in November 2016 and ending in April 2017.  Each minimum required additional purchase of Preferred Units is   5,000   units. Battery Point may redeem the Preferred Units at any time, subject to payment to the Company of an exit fee in the amount of   1.0%   of the redemption price if Battery Point redeems the Preferred Units after April 28, 2017. 
  Financing Subsequent to September 30, 2016 
  353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan 
  On October 14, 2016, the Company, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a   two  -year secured mortgage loan with an unaffiliated lender, for borrowings of up to   $115.5 million   secured by 353 Sacramento (the  353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan ). As of October 14, 2016,   $85.5 million   had been disbursed to the Company with the remaining   $30.0 million   available for future disbursements to be used for tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capital improvements, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the loan documents. The 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan matures on October 14, 2018 with   three     one  -year extension options, subject to certain conditions contained in the loan documents and the payment of an extension fee of   0.25%   of the outstanding principal balance with respect to the second and third extension options. The 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan bears interest at a floating rate of   275   basis points over one-month LIBOR. The borrower entered into an interest rate cap that effectively limits one-month LIBOR on   $115.5 million   of the outstanding loan balance at   3.0%   effective October 14, 2016 through October 14, 2018. Monthly payments are interest-only with the entire unpaid principal balance and all outstanding interest and fees due at maturity. The Company has the right to prepay the loan in whole at any time or in part from time to time to the extent necessary, subject to the payment of certain expenses potentially incurred by the lender as a result of the prepayment, the payment of a prepayment premium and certain other conditions contained in the loan documents.  
  KBS SOR Properties provided a limited guaranty of the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan with respect to certain potential deficiencies, losses or damages suffered by the lender resulting from certain intentional acts committed by the borrower or KBS SOR Properties in violation of the loan documents, or in the event of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the borrower or KBS SOR Properties. 
  As a condition to the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan, the borrowing subsidiary amended its operating agreement to appoint two independent managers.  The independent managers have consent rights with respect to (i) the consolidation or merger of the borrower into another entity if the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan will not be paid off in connection with such merger or consolidation, (ii) the sale of the borrower s assets if the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan will not be paid off in connection with such a sale and (iii) the institution of voluntary (or the consent to involuntary) bankruptcy or similar creditor-protection proceedings.  Such consent rights will only apply as long as the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan remains outstanding.

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. and the notes thereto.  As used herein, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, KBS Strategic Opportunity Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the  Operating Partnership,  and to their subsidiaries.   
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements.  Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as  may,   will,   seeks,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   expects,   plans,   intends,   should  or similar expressions.  Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law.   
  The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:   
             
    We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. Revenues from our property investments could decrease due to a reduction in tenants (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases) and/or lower rental rates, limiting our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
                
    We have paid distributions from financings and in the future we may not pay distributions solely from our cash flow from operations or gains from asset sales. To the extent that we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations or gains from asset sales, we will have less funds available for investment in loans, properties and other assets, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors may experience dilution. 
                
    All of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, our dealer manager and other KBS-affiliated entities.  As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our advisor s compensation arrangements with us and other KBS-advised programs and investors and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs and investors.  These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions.  Fees paid to our advisor in connection with transactions involving the origination, acquisition and management of our investments are based on the cost of the investment, not on the quality of the investment or services rendered to us.  This arrangement could influence our advisor to recommend riskier transactions to us.  
                
    We pay substantial fees to and expenses of our advisor and its affiliates and, in connection with our initial public offering, we paid substantial fees to our dealer manager and participating broker-dealers. These payments increase the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment in us and increase our stockholders  risk of loss. 
                
    We cannot predict with any certainty how much, if any, of our dividend reinvestment plan proceeds will be available for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the redemption of shares under our share redemption program, future funding obligations under any real estate loans receivable we acquire, the funding of capital expenditures on our real estate investments or the repayment of debt.  If such funds are not available from the dividend reinvestment plan offering, then we may have to use a greater proportion of our cash flow from operations to meet these cash requirements, which would reduce cash available for distributions and could limit our ability to redeem shares under our share redemption program. 
                
    Our opportunistic investment strategy involves a higher risk of loss than would a strategy of investing in performing real estate and real estate related assets.  
     All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).

  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

Overview 
  We were formed on October 8, 2008 as a Maryland corporation, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and intend to operate in such manner.  KBS Capital Advisors LLC ( KBS Capital Advisors ) is our advisor.  As our advisor, KBS Capital Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of investments.  KBS Capital Advisors also has the authority to make all of the decisions regarding our investments, subject to the limitations in our charter and the direction and oversight of our board of directors.  KBS Capital Advisors will also provide asset-management, marketing, investor-relations and other administrative services on our behalf.  
  On January 8, 2009, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to offer a minimum of 250,000 shares and a maximum of 140,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 100,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 40,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan.  We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on November 14, 2012. We sold   56,584,976   shares of common stock in the primary offering for gross offering proceeds of   $561.7 million  .  We continue to offer shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had sold   5,804,835   shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $  62.3 million  .  Also as of   September 30, 2016  , we had redeemed   5,635,755   of the shares sold in our offering for $  69.9 million  .  Additionally, on December 29, 2011 and October 23, 2012, we issued   220,994   shares and   55,249   shares of common stock, respectively, for   $2.0 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.   
  On March 2, 2016, KBS Strategic Opportunity (BVI) Holdings, Ltd. ( KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI ), our wholly owned subsidiary, filed a final prospectus with the Israel Securities Authority for a proposed offering of up to 1,000,000,000 Israeli new Shekels of Series A debentures (the  Debentures ) at an annual interest rate not to exceed 4.25%. On March 1, 2016, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the institutional tender of the Debentures and accepted application for 842.5 million Israeli new Shekels. On March 7, 2016, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the public tender of the Debentures and accepted 127.7 million Israeli new Shekels.  In the aggregate, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI accepted 970.2 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately   $259.0 million   as of September 30, 2016) in both the institutional and public tenders at an annual interest rate of 4.25%.  KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI issued the Debentures on March 8, 2016. The terms of the Debentures require principal installment payments equal to 20% of the face value of the Debentures on March 1st of each year from 2019 to 2023.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   11   office properties,   one   office campus consisting of   nine   office buildings,   one   office portfolio consisting of   four   office buildings and   25   acres of undeveloped land,   one   office portfolio consisting of   three   office properties,    one   office/flex/industrial portfolio consisting of   21   buildings,   one   retail property,   two   apartment properties, two investments in undeveloped land encompassing an aggregate of   1,670   acres and   two   investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 
   
  Market Outlook   Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets 
  The following discussion is based on management s beliefs, observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets. 
  Current conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as we near the end of 2016. Current economic data and financial market developments suggest that the global economy is improving, although at a slow incremental rate. Growth in most advanced economies remains lackluster, with low potential growth expectations now extending into 2017.  In this economic environment the central banks of the world s major economies hold sway over perceived investment opportunities.  Quantitative easing in Japan and the Eurozone has carried over into global capital markets and has increased demand for higher risk investments. 
  The initial reaction to the U.K. vote to leave the European Union has been somewhat muted, with the exception being the continued downward pressure on the Great Britain Pound ( GBP ).  As of mid-October 2016, the GBP had weakened in excess of 20 percent, year-to-date.  The new prime minister of the U.K. remains committed to carrying out the decoupling of the U.K. from the European Union.  The details of this process remain unclear, and the uncertainty has weighed on both the U.K. and European markets.  The European Central Bank has continued to pursue a policy of quantitative easing (QE).

In the United States, real GDP growth accelerated in the third quarter of 2016 to a 2.9% annual rate.  This is a marked improvement over the second quarter growth rate of 1.4%.  The strong third quarter number is tempered by the fact that a large portion of gross domestic product growth was seen in increased inventories, not through consumer demand.  Consumer confidence is currently at a three year low.  Corporate earnings are also an area of concern, as third quarter reported earnings growth showed a clear sign of slowing.  Federal Reserve Board communications have been signaling the increased likelihood of some firming of monetary policy.  Many economists expect an increase in rates to occur in early December.  The US government bond yield curve has seen a steady increase in yields and is currently no longer sitting at near record lows. 
  Europe and Japan continue to engage in unconventional monetary policy. Asset purchases and stimulus programs in both regions have driven interest rates and investment yields to new lows. Both regions now have historically low interest rates, with some government and corporate bonds trading with negative yields. While the intent of these policies is to spur economic growth, the size of these programs is unprecedented, and the ultimate impact on those economies and the broader global financial system remains unclear.  
  The U.S. commercial real estate market continues to benefit from inflows of foreign capital, albeit at a slowing rate.  With the backdrop global political conflict, and weaker international economic conditions, the U.S. dollar has remained a safe haven currency.  Lenders, however, have continued to cool to the market.  For balance sheet lenders, such as banks and insurance companies, underwriting standards for commercial real estate have been tightened. This has resulted in lower loan-to-value and higher debt coverage ratios. CMBS originations also have been limited as lenders are trying to adjust to the new securitization rules which require issuers to maintain an ongoing equity stake in pooled transactions. These trends have led to increased uncertainty in the level and cost of debt for commercial properties, and in turn has injected some volatility into commercial real estate markets.  
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal demand for funds during the short and long-term is and will be for the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related investments; payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses; payments under debt obligations; redemptions of common stock; and payments of distributions to stockholders. To date, we have had six primary sources of capital for meeting our cash requirements:  
             
    Proceeds from the primary portion of our initial public offering;   
                
    Proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan; 
                
    Debt financing; 
                
    Proceeds from our public bond offering in Israel; 
                
    Proceeds from the sale of real estate and the repayment of real estate-related investments; and 
                
    Cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments.   
     We sold   56,584,976   shares of common stock in the primary portion of our initial public offering for gross offering proceeds of   $561.7 million  .  We ceased offering shares in the primary portion of our initial public offering on November 14, 2012.  We continue to offer shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had sold   5,804,835   shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $  62.3 million  .  To date, we have invested all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in real estate and real estate-related investments.  We intend to use our cash on hand, proceeds from debt financing, proceeds from the issuance of our 4.25% bonds in Israel, cash flow generated by our real estate operations and proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan as our primary sources of immediate and long-term liquidity.  
  Our investments in real estate generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements, which are reduced by operating expenditures and corporate general and administrative expenses.  Cash flow from operations from our real estate investments is primarily dependent upon the occupancy levels of our properties, the net effective rental rates on our leases, the collectibility of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our office, retail and industrial properties were collectively   87%   occupied and our apartment properties were collectively   90%   occupied.

Investments in real estate-related loans generate cash flow in the form of interest income, which are reduced by loan service fees, asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses. On June 30, 2015, the University House First Mortgage Loan matured without repayment. On April 21, 2016, the University House First Mortgage Loan lender entered into an assignment of mortgage to assign the University House First Mortgage Loan to an assignee unaffiliated with us or our advisor. On April 22, 2016, we received   $31.6 million   in connection with the assignment of the University House First Mortgage Loan.  The proceeds received from the assignment reflects the entire principal balance and interest due, including any default interest, as of April 21, 2016, plus any legal costs incurred by us in connection with the assignment.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of   $948.0 million  , with a weighted average remaining term of 2.8 years.  
  Under our charter, we are required to limit our total operating expenses to the greater of 2% of our average invested assets or 25% of our net income for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters, as these terms are defined in our charter, unless the Conflicts Committee of our board of directors has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. Operating expense reimbursements for the four fiscal quarters ended   September 30, 2016   did not exceed the charter imposed limitation.  
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash needs for capital expenditures, redemptions of common stock and debt servicing were met with proceeds from debt financing, proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan and cash on hand.  Operating cash needs during the same period were met through cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments and cash on hand.  As of September 30, 2016, we had a total of $423.5 million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within 12 months of that date. We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements or pay down or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates. 
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   11   office properties,   one   office campus consisting of   nine   office buildings,   one   office portfolio consisting of   four   office buildings and   25   acres of undeveloped land,   one   office portfolio consisting of   three   office properties,   one   office/flex/industrial portfolio consisting of   21   buildings,   one   retail property,   two   apartment properties, two investments in undeveloped land encompassing an aggregate of   1,670   acres and   two   investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was $  19.1 million  .  We expect that our cash flows from operating activities will increase in future periods as a result of leasing additional space that is currently unoccupied and anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments.  However, our cash flows from operating activities may decrease to the extent that we dispose of assets. 
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $300.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and primarily consisted of the following: 
             
    Acquisition of an office/flex/industrial portfolio consisting of   21   buildings and an office property for $293.8 million; 
                
    Principal proceeds received from the assignment of University House in the amount of $27.9 million; 
                
    Improvements to real estate of   $21.5 million  ;  
                
    Restricted cash for capital expenditures of $7.8 million; 
                
    Additional investment in an unconsolidated joint venture of $2.8 million;  
                
    Funding of restricted cash for development obligations of $2.6 million; and 
                
    Proceeds from insurance claims of $0.3 million.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities was   $296.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and consisted  primarily of the following:   
             
    $371.6 million of net cash provided by debt and other financings as a result of proceeds from notes and bonds payable of $462.2 million, partially offset by principal payments on notes payable of $74.7 million, payments of deferred financing costs of $10.6 million and restricted cash for debt service obligations of $5.3 million; 
                
    $38.0 million of acquisitions of noncontrolling interests; 
                
    $31.5 million of payments made to redeem shares of common stock; 
                
    $6.9 million of net cash distributions to stockholders, after giving effect to distributions reinvested by stockholders of $9.5 million;  
                
    $0.8 million of contributions from noncontrolling interests;  
                
    $0.7 million of net cash provided by the issuance of $0.8 million of preferred membership units of our subsidiary, partially offset by sale commissions and other costs of $0.1 million; and 
                
    $0.2 million of payments made in connection with a potential offering. 
     In order to execute our investment strategy, we utilize secured debt and we may, to the extent available, utilize unsecured debt to finance a portion of our investment portfolio.  Management remains vigilant in monitoring the risks inherent with the use of debt in our portfolio and is taking actions to ensure that these risks, including refinancing and interest risks, are properly balanced with the benefit of using leverage. There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for any single investment.  Our charter limits our total liabilities such that our total liabilities may not exceed 75% of the cost of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if a majority of the Conflicts Committee approves each borrowing in excess of our charter limitation and we disclose such borrowing to our common stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the Conflicts Committee of the justification for the excess borrowing.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 70% of the cost (before depreciation or other noncash reserves) and book value (before depreciation) of our tangible assets.   
  In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we use or have used our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and our dealer manager. During our offering stage, these payments included payments to our dealer manager for selling commissions and dealer manager fees related to sales in our primary offering and payments to our dealer manager and our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and other offering expenses related both to the primary offering and the dividend reinvestment plan.  During our acquisition and development stage, we expect to continue to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection and origination or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us as well as for any dispositions of assets (including the discounted payoff of non-performing loans). In addition, an affiliate of our advisor, KBS Management Group, was recently formed to provide property management services with respect to certain properties owned by KBS-advised companies.  In the future, we may engage KBS Management Group with respect to one or more of our properties to provide property management services.  With respect to any such properties, we would expect to pay KBS Management Group a monthly fee equal to a percentage of the rent (to be determined on a property by property basis, consistent with current market rates). 
  The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our Conflicts Committee. 
  Among the fees payable to our advisor is an asset management fee. With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of 0.75% of the lesser of (i) the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment, inclusive of fees and expenses related thereto and the amount of any debt associated with or used to acquire or fund such investment and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment, as of the time of calculation. With respect to investments in real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the sum of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property, and inclusive of fees and expenses related thereto and the amount of any debt associated with or used to acquire such investment. In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee will be determined based on our proportionate share of the underlying investment, inclusive of our proportionate share of any fees and expenses related thereto.

Contractual Commitments and Contingencies 
  The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands):   

_____________________ 
   (1)    Amounts include principal payments only.   
   (2)    Projected interest payments are based on the outstanding principal amounts, maturity dates, foreign currency rate and interest rates in effect at   September 30, 2016  .  We incurred interest expense of $18.9 million, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs of   $2.9 million   and including interest capitalized of   $1.5 million  , for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Overview 
  As of September 30, 2015, we owned 10 office properties, one office campus consisting of nine office buildings, one office portfolio consisting of four office buildings and 37 acres of undeveloped land, one office portfolio consisting of three office properties, one retail property, two apartment properties, two investments in undeveloped land encompassing an aggregate of 1,670 acres, one first mortgage loan and two investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   11   office properties,   one   office campus consisting of   nine   office buildings,   one   office portfolio consisting of   four   office buildings and   25   acres of undeveloped land,   one   office portfolio consisting of   three   office properties,   one   office/flex/industrial portfolio consisting of   21   buildings,   one   retail property,   two   apartment properties, two investments in undeveloped land encompassing an aggregate of   1,670   acres,   one   first mortgage loan and   two   investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.  Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   may not be indicative of those in future periods as the occupancy in our properties has not been stabilized.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our office, retail and industrial properties were collectively   87%   occupied and our apartment properties were collectively   90%   occupied.  However, due to the short outstanding weighted-average lease term in the portfolio of less than four years, we do not put significant emphasis on quarterly changes in occupancy (positive or negative) in the short run. Our underwriting and valuations are generally more sensitive to  terminal values  that may be realized upon the disposition of the assets in the portfolio and less sensitive to ongoing cash flows generated by the portfolio in the years leading up to an eventual sale.  There are no guarantees that occupancies of our assets will increase, or that we will recognize a gain on the sale of our assets.  We funded the acquisitions of these investments with proceeds from our initial public offering and debt financing.  In general, we expect that our income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future periods as a result of leasing additional space and acquiring additional assets but decrease due to disposition activity.

Comparison of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the three months ended September 30, 2015 
  The following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (dollar amounts in thousands): 

_____________________ 
   (1)    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to real estate and real estate-related investments acquired, repaid or disposed on or after July 1, 2015.   
   (2)    Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 with respect to real estate and real estate-related investments owned by us during the entire periods presented.   
  Rental income and tenant reimbursements increased from   $22.3 million   and   $4.9 million  , respectively, for the three months ended  September 30, 2015 to   $29.2 million   and   $5.9 million  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the growth in our real estate portfolio and as a result of an increase in occupancy from 84% as of September 30, 2015 to 88% as of September 30, 2016 related to properties (excluding apartments) held throughout both periods. In addition, annualized base rent per square foot increased from $21.16 as of September 30, 2015 to $21.92 as of September 30, 2016 related to properties (excluding apartments) held throughout both periods. We expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to increase in future periods as a result of owning real estate acquired in 2016 for an entire period, anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and leasing additional space but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
  Property operating costs and real estate taxes and insurance increased from   $9.9 million   and   $3.9 million  , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $10.9 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the growth in our real estate portfolio. We expect property operating costs and real estate taxes and insurance to increase in future periods as a result of owning real estate acquired in 2016 for an entire period, anticipated future acquisitions of real estate, increasing occupancy of our real estate assets and inflation but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
  Asset management fees increased from   $2.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $2.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the growth in our real estate portfolio.  We expect asset management fees to increase in future periods as a result of owning real estate acquired in 2016 for an entire period, anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and capital expenditures but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. All asset management fees incurred as of   September 30, 2016   have been paid.   
  Real estate acquisition fees and expenses to affiliates and non-affiliates were   $2.0 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  We did not acquire any real estate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and, therefore, did not incur any acquisition fees or expenses during the period. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired one real estate property for   $168.0 million  . We expect real estate acquisition fees and expenses to vary in future periods based upon acquisition activity.

General and administrative expenses increased from   $0.9 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $1.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to increased legal and auditor costs as a result of our ongoing Israeli securities law compliance requirements related to our outstanding bonds. We expect general and administrative expenses to fluctuate based on our legal expenses and investment and disposition activity.  
  We recognized   $6.6 million   of foreign currency transaction loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 related to the issuance of Series A debentures in Israel, consisting of $8.1 million of foreign currency transaction loss, partially offset by $1.5 million foreign currency transaction gain as a result of our foreign currency collars. These debentures are denominated in Israeli new Shekels and we expect to recognize foreign transaction gains and losses to the extent that we do not enter into a foreign currency collar or hedge. We did not recognize any foreign currency transaction gain or loss during the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
  Depreciation and amortization increased from   $11.3 million   for the three months ended  September 30, 2015 to   $14.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the growth in our real estate portfolio. We expect depreciation and amortization to increase in future periods as a result of owning real estate acquired in 2016 and anticipated future acquisitions of real estate for an entire period but to decrease as a result of amortization of tenant origination costs related to lease expirations and the disposition of properties. 
  Interest expense increased from   $3.5 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to   $8.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to increased borrowings as a result of our bond offering and additional mortgage financing. Excluded from interest expense was   $0.5 million   of interest capitalized to our investments in undeveloped land during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on interest rate fluctuations, the amount of interest capitalized and our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives. 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had no dispositions. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we sold one office property and 14.5 acres of undeveloped land that resulted in a gain on sale of $2.9 million. 
  Comparison of the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the nine months ended September 30, 2015

Rental income and tenant reimbursements increased from   $66.3 million   and   $14.0 million  , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $76.6 million   and   $15.5 million  , respectively, for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the growth in our real estate portfolio and as a result of an increase in occupancy from 84% as of September 30, 2015 to 88% as of September 30, 2016 related to properties (excluding apartments) held throughout both periods. In addition, annualized base rent per square foot increased from $21.16 as of September 30, 2015 to $21.92 as of September 30, 2016 related to properties (excluding apartments) held throughout both periods. We expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to increase in future periods as a result of owning real estate acquired in 2016 for an entire period, anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and leasing additional space but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
  Interest income from our real estate loan receivable, recognized using the interest method, increased from   $2.0 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $3.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of our recognition and collection of default interest during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  On June 30, 2015, the University House First Mortgage Loan matured without repayment.  On July 1, 2015, we provided notice to the borrower of default.  We determined the real estate loan receivable to be impaired and recognized interest income from our real estate loan receivable on a cash basis. On April 21, 2016, we entered into an assignment of mortgage to assign the University House First Mortgage Loan to an assignee unaffiliated with the us or our advisor. On April 22, 2016, we received   $31.6 million   in connection with the assignment of the University House First Mortgage Loan.  The proceeds received from the assignment reflects the entire principal balance and interest due, including any default interest, as of April 21, 2016, plus any legal costs incurred by us in connection with the assignment.  
  Property operating costs and real estate taxes and insurance increased from   $27.9 million   and   $11.4 million  , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $29.8 million   and   $12.4 million  , respectively, for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the growth in our real estate portfolio. We expect property operating costs and real estate taxes and insurance to increase in future periods as a result of owning real estate acquired in 2016 for an entire period, anticipated future acquisitions of real estate, increasing occupancy of our real estate assets and inflation but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
  Asset management fees increased from   $6.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $6.9 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the growth in our real estate portfolio.  We expect asset management fees to increase in future periods as a result of owning real estate acquired in 2016 for an entire period and capital expenditures but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. All asset management fees incurred as of   September 30, 2016   have been paid.  
  Real estate acquisition fees and expenses to affiliate and non-affiliates were $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  We did not acquire any real estate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired   one   office portfolio and   one   office property for $293.8 million. We expect real estate acquisition fees and expenses to vary in future periods based upon acquisition activity. 
  General and administrative expenses increased from   $2.6 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $4.2 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to increased legal and auditor costs as a result of our ongoing Israeli securities law compliance requirements related to our outstanding bonds. We expect general and administrative expenses to fluctuate based on our legal expenses and investment and disposition activity.  
  We recognized   $4.6 million   of foreign currency transaction loss, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the issuance of Series A debentures in Israel, consisting of $6.1 million of foreign currency transaction loss, partially offset by $1.5 million foreign currency transaction gain as a result of our foreign currency collars.  These debentures are denominated in Israeli new Shekels and we expect to recognize foreign transaction gains and losses to the extent that we do not enter into a foreign currency collar or hedge.  We did not recognize any foreign currency transaction gain or loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Depreciation and amortization increased from   $33.7 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $37.4 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the growth in our real estate portfolio.  We expect depreciation and amortization to increase in future periods as a result of owning real estate acquired in 2016 for an entire period but to decrease as a result of amortization of tenant origination costs related to lease expirations and the disposition of properties.

Interest expense increased from   $11.3 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to   $20.4 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to increased borrowings as a result of our bond offering and additional mortgage financing. Excluded from interest expense was   $1.5 million   of interest capitalized to our investments in undeveloped land during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on interest rate fluctuations, the amount of interest capitalized and our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing and the opportunity to acquire real estate and real estate-related investments meeting our investment objectives. 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received $5.9 million in proceeds from condemnation agreements. The carrying value of the condemned land was $0.8 million, resulting in a gain of $5.1 million, which is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had no dispositions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we sold two office properties and 14.5 acres of undeveloped land that resulted in a gain on sale of $11.2 million.  
   
  Funds from Operations, Modified Funds from Operations and Adjusted Modified Funds from Operations 
  We believe that funds from operations ( FFO ) is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) definition.  FFO represents net income, excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), impairment losses on real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  We believe FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other REITs.  However, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.  Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and provides a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. 
  Changes in accounting rules have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of non-operating and non-cash items included in the calculation of FFO.  Items such as acquisition fees and expenses, which had previously been capitalized prior to 2009, are currently expensed and accounted for as operating expenses.  As a result, our management also uses modified funds from operations ( MFFO ) as an indicator of our ongoing performance as well as our dividend sustainability.  MFFO excludes from FFO: acquisition fees and expenses; adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; amounts relating to straight-line rents and amortization of above- and below-market intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; amortization of closing costs relating to debt investments; impairments of real estate-related investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; and gains or losses included in net income for the extinguishment or sale of debt or hedges.  We compute MFFO in accordance with the definition of MFFO included in the practice guideline issued by the Investment Program Association ( IPA ) in November 2010 as interpreted by management.  Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not compute MFFO in accordance with the current IPA definition or that interpret the current IPA definition differently than we do.   
  In addition, our management uses an adjusted MFFO ( Adjusted MFFO ) as an indicator of our ongoing performance as well as our dividend sustainability.  Adjusted MFFO provides adjustments to reduce MFFO related to operating expenses that are capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land.

  PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED) 
  Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

We believe that MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are helpful as measures of ongoing operating performance because they exclude costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO.  Management believes that excluding acquisition costs from MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the portfolio over time, including periods after our acquisition stage.  MFFO and Adjusted MFFO also exclude non-cash items such as straight-line rental revenue.  Additionally, we believe that MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provide investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance indicators and analysis used by management, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, to evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance.  MFFO provides comparability in evaluating the operating performance of our portfolio with other non-traded REITs which typically have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies.  MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes.   
  FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are non-GAAP financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by GAAP.  Net income as defined by GAAP is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization and the other items described above.  Accordingly, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our current and historical operating performance.  In addition, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an indication of our liquidity.  We believe FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are meaningful supplemental performance measures. 
  Although MFFO includes other adjustments, the exclusion of straight-line rent amortization of above- and below-market leases, acquisition fees and expenses and mark-to-market foreign currency transaction adjustments, are the most significant adjustments for the periods presented.  We have excluded these items based on the following economic considerations: 
             
    Adjustments for straight-line rent.    These are adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize contractual lease payments on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease.  We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our in-place leases, while also providing investors with a useful supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance by removing rent we expect to receive in a future period or rent that was received in a prior period;  
                
    Amortization of above- and below-market leases.    Similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and lease related costs that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangible lease assets and liabilities diminishes predictably over time and requires that these charges be recognized currently in revenue.  Since market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with local market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economics of the real estate;  
                
    Acquisition fees and expenses.   Acquisition fees and expenses related to the acquisition of real estate are expensed.  Although these amounts reduce net income, we exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. Additionally, acquisition costs have been funded from the proceeds from our now terminated initial public offering and debt financings, including our Israeli bond offering, and not from our operations. We believe this exclusion is useful to investors as it allows investors to more accurately evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance; and 
                
    Mark-to-market foreign currency transaction adjustments.   The U.S. dollar is our functional currency.  Transactions denominated in currency other than our functional currency are recorded upon initial recognition at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. After initial recognition, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are remeasured at each reporting date into the foreign currency at the exchange rate on that date. In addition, we have entered into foreign currency collars that results in a foreign currency transaction adjustment. These amounts can increase or reduce net income. We exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. 
     Adjusted MFFO includes adjustments to reduce MFFO related to real estate taxes, property insurance and financing costs which are capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land.  We have included adjustments for the costs incurred necessary to bring these investments to their intended use, as these costs are recurring operating costs that are capitalized in accordance with GAAP and not reflected in our net income (loss), FFO and MFFO.

Our calculation of FFO, which we believe is consistent with the calculation of FFO as defined by NAREIT, is presented in the following table, along with our calculations of MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 (in thousands). No conclusions or comparisons should be made from the presentation of these periods.

   (1)      Reflects adjustments to eliminate the noncontrolling interest holders  share of the adjustments to convert our net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO. 
   (2)      Reflects adjustments to add back our noncontrolling interest share of the adjustments to convert our net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO for our equity investment in an unconsolidated joint venture. 
   (3)    Reflects real estate taxes, property insurance and financing costs that are capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land.  During the time in which we are incurring costs necessary to bring these investments to their intended use, certain normal recurring operating costs are capitalized in accordance with GAAP and not reflected in our net (loss) income, FFO and MFFO.     
  FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO may also be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs.  We expect FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO to improve in future periods to the extent that we continue to lease up vacant space and acquire additional assets. We expect FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO to decrease as a result of dispositions.

Distributions 
  Distributions declared, distributions paid and cash flows used in operations were as follows for the first, second and third quarters of 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

On March 9, 2016, our board of directors authorized a distribution in the amount of $0.09323770 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 22, 2016. We paid this distribution on March 29, 2016 and this was the only distribution declared and paid during the first quarter of 2016. 
  On June 17, 2016, our board of directors authorized a distribution in the amount of $0.09323770 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 17, 2016. We paid this distribution on June 22, 2016 and this was the only distribution declared and paid during the second quarter of 2016.  
  On September 15, 2016, our board of directors authorized a distribution in the amount of $0.09426230 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016. We paid this distribution on September 22, 2016 and this was the only distribution declared and paid during the third quarter of 2016.  
  Our net loss attributable to common stockholders for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $21.8 million   and our cash flows provided by operations were   $19.1 million  .  Our cumulative distributions paid and net loss attributable to common stockholders from inception through   September 30, 2016   were $99.4 million and $50.4 million, respectively.  We funded the March 29, 2016 distribution with current and prior period cash provided by operations surplus. We funded the June 22, 2016 distribution and the September 22, 2016 distribution with current cash provided by operations. We have funded our cumulative distributions, which includes net cash distributions and distributions reinvested by stockholders, with proceeds from debt financing of $18.7 million, proceeds from the dispositions of property of $13.7 million and cash provided by operations of $67.0 million. To the extent that we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations or gains from asset sales, we will have fewer funds available for investment in real estate-related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt securities and other real estate-related investments, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors may experience dilution. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.  These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements.  Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.  A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC.  There have been no significant changes to our policies during 2016, except for the addition of an accounting policy with respect to foreign currency transactions.

Foreign currency transactions 
  The U.S. dollar is our functional currency.  Transactions denominated in currency other than our functional currency are recorded upon initial recognition at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. After initial recognition, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are remeasured at each reporting date into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Exchange rate differences, other than those accounted for as hedging transactions, are recognized as foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.   
   
  Subsequent Events 
  We evaluate subsequent events up until the date the consolidated financial statements are issued.   
  Real Estate Related Investment Subsequent to September 30, 2016 
  Battery Point Series B Preferred Units 
  On October 28, 2016, we, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a purchase agreement to purchase up to an aggregate of   25,000   units of Series B Preferred Units (the  Preferred Units ) of Battery Point Trust LLC ( Battery Point ), over a six-month period at a per-unit price of   $1,000  , resulting in an aggregate investment of   $25.0 million  . On October 28, 2016, we purchased an initial   5,000   Preferred Units, net of an equity commitment fee of   $0.6 million  , for a net payment of   $4.4 million  . The Preferred Units are entitled to the payment of quarterly distributions at the following annual rates:   7.0%   for the period commencing October 28, 2016 through April 28, 2017;   9.0%   for the period commencing April 29, 2017 through April 28, 2018; and   12.0%   for the period commencing April 29, 2018 through October 28, 2019. We may be required to purchase additional Preferred Units no more frequently than once a month during the period beginning in November 2016 and ending in April 2017.  Each minimum required additional purchase of Preferred Units is   5,000   units. Battery Point may redeem the Preferred Units at any time, subject to payment to us of an exit fee in the amount of   1.0%   of the redemption price if Battery Point redeems the Preferred Units after April 28, 2017. 
  Financing Subsequent to September 30, 2016 
  353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan 
  On October 14, 2016, we, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a two-year secured mortgage loan with an unaffiliated lender, for borrowings of up to $115.5 million secured by 353 Sacramento (the  353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan ). As of October 14 2016, $85.5 million had been disbursed to us with the remaining $30.0 million available for future disbursements to be used for tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capital improvements, subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the loan documents. The 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan matures on October 14, 2018 with three one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions contained in the loan documents and the payment of an extension fee of 0.25% of the outstanding principal balance with respect to the second and third extension options. The 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan bears interest at a floating rate of 275 basis points over one-month LIBOR. The borrower entered into an interest rate cap that effectively limits one-month LIBOR on $115.5 million of the outstanding loan balance at 3.00% effective October 14, 2016 through October 14, 2018. Monthly payments are interest-only with the entire unpaid principal balance and all outstanding interest and fees due at maturity. We have the right to prepay the loan in whole at any time or in part from time to time to the extent necessary, subject to the payment of certain expenses potentially incurred by the lender as a result of the prepayment, the payment of a prepayment premium and certain other conditions contained in the loan documents.  
  KBS SOR Properties, LLC, our separate wholly owned subsidiary through which we indirectly owns all of our real estate assets ( KBS SOR Properties ), provided a limited guaranty of the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan with respect to certain potential deficiencies, losses or damages suffered by the lender resulting from certain intentional acts committed by the borrower or KBS SOR Properties in violation of the loan documents, or in the event of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the borrower or KBS SOR Properties. 
  As a condition to the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan, the borrowing subsidiary amended its operating agreement to appoint two independent managers.  The independent managers have consent rights with respect to (i) the consolidation or merger of the borrower into another entity if the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan will not be paid off in connection with such merger or consolidation, (ii) the sale of the borrower s assets if the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan will not be paid off in connection with such a sale and (iii) the institution of voluntary (or the consent to involuntary) bankruptcy or similar creditor-protection proceedings.  Such consent rights will only apply as long as the 353 Sacramento Mortgage Loan remains outstanding.

  Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity, fund distributions and to fund the refinancing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. We may also be exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates as a result of the acquisition and origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans and the acquisition of real estate securities. We are also exposed to the effects of foreign currency changes in Israel with respect to the 4.25% bonds issued to Israeli investors in March 2016. Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes and foreign currency changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We may manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level. In addition, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, floors, and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations. In order to limit the effects of changes in foreign currency on our operations, we may utilize a variety of foreign currency hedging strategies such as cross currency swaps, forward contracts, puts or calls. When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments. Additionally, certain of these strategies may cause us to fund a margin account periodically to offset changes in foreign currency rates which may also reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock. As of September 30, 2016, we had entered into four foreign currency collars to hedge against a change in the exchange rate of the Israeli new Shekel versus the U.S. Dollar. The foreign currency collars expire in August 2017 and have an aggregate U.S. Dollar notional amount of   $250.0 million  . The foreign currency collars consist of purchased call options to buy Israeli new Shekels ranging from 3.6686 to 3.7245 and sold put options to sell the Israeli new Shekels ranging from   3.7695   to   3.826  . The foreign currency collars are intended to permit us to exchange, on the settlement date of the collars and net of the effect of the collars, $250.0 million for an amount of Israeli new Shekels ranging from   923.1 million   to   948.4 million  . 
  As of September 30, 2016, we held 0.3 million Israeli new Shekels and 21.8 million Israeli new Shekels in cash and restricted cash, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2016, we had bonds outstanding and the related interest payable in the amounts of 970.2 million Israeli new Shekels and 3.4 million Israeli new Shekels, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Based solely on the remeasurement for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , if foreign currency exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, our net income would increase or decrease by approximately $23.0 million and $28.1 million for the same period, respectively. The foreign currency transaction income or loss as a result of the change in foreign currency exchange rates does not take into account any gains or losses on our foreign currency collars as a result of such change, which would reduce our foreign currency exposure. 
  We borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates.  Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated.  However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments.   As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of our KBS SOR (BVI) Holdings, Ltd. Series A Debentures was   $250.2 million   and the outstanding principal balance was   $259.0 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , excluding the KBS SOR (BVI) Holdings, Ltd. Series A Debentures, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was $34.4 million and the outstanding principal balance of our fixed rate debt was $31.6 million.  The fair value estimate of our KBS SOR (BVI) Holdings, Ltd. Series A Debentures was calculated using the quoted bond price as of September 30, 2016 on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange of 96.62 Israeli new Shekels. The fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loans were originated as of   September 30, 2016  .  As we expect to hold our fixed rate instruments to maturity and the amounts due under such instruments would be limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting changes in fair value of our fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on our operations.  
  Conversely, movements in interest rates on variable rate debt and loans receivable would change our future earnings and cash flows, but would not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments.  However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of floating rate instruments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $657.4 million of variable rate debt outstanding.  Based on interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  , if interest rates were 100 basis points higher during the 12 months ending September 30, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by $6.6 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , one-month LIBOR was 0.53111% and if the LIBOR index was reduced to 0% during the 12 months ending September 30, 2017, interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease by $3.4 million.

  Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
           a) 
    During the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. 
              b) 
    Not applicable.  
              c) 
    We have adopted a share redemption program that may enable stockholders to sell their shares to us in limited circumstances. 
     Pursuant to the share redemption program there are several limitations on our ability to redeem shares:   
             
    Unless the shares are being redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence  (each as defined under the share redemption program), we may not redeem shares until the stockholder has held the shares for one year. 
                
    During any calendar year, we may redeem no more than 5% of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the prior calendar year. 
                
    We have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under Maryland law, which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency. 
                
    During 2016, we may not redeem more than $3.0 million of shares in a given quarter (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence ). To the extent that we redeem less than $3.0 million of shares (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence ) in a given fiscal quarter, any remaining excess capacity to redeem shares in such fiscal quarter will be added to our capacity to otherwise redeem shares (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence ) during the succeeding fiscal quarter.  We may increase or decrease this limit upon ten business days' notice to stockholders. Our board of directors may approve an increase in this limit to the extent that we have received proceeds from asset sales or the refinancing of debt or for any other reason deemed appropriate by the board of directors. On September 15, 2016, our board of directors approved an additional $25.0 million of funds available for the redemption of shares for the third quarter of 2016. Any excess capacity to redeem shares during the third quarter of 2016 will be added to our capacity to otherwise redeem shares during subsequent periods.  
     Upon a transfer of shares any pending redemption requests with respect to such transferred shares will be canceled as of the date we accept the transfer.  Stockholders wishing to continue to have a redemption request related to any transferred shares considered by us must resubmit their redemption request. 
  We may amend, suspend or terminate the program upon 30 days  notice to our stockholders.  We may provide this notice by including such information in a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC, or by a separate mailing to our stockholders.

  Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (continued) 

During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we fulfilled redemption requests and redeemed shares pursuant to the share redemption program as follows:  
   
 _____________________ 
   (1)    On December 8, 2015, our board of directors adopted an eighth amended and restated share redemption program (the  Eighth Amended Share Redemption Program ). Pursuant to the Eighth Amended Share Redemption Program, except for redemptions made upon a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence,  the prices at which we will redeem shares are as follows: (i) 97.5% of our most recent estimated value per share as of the applicable redemption date for those shares held for at least one year but less than four years; and (ii) 100% of the Company s most recent estimated value per share as of the applicable redemption date for those shares held for at least four years. The Eighth Amended Share Redemption Program limits redemptions to $3.0 million of shares in a given quarter (excluding shares redeemed in connection with a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence ). However, on September 15, 2016, our board of directors approved an additional $25 million of funds available for the redemption of shares for the third quarter of 2016 and subsequent periods to the extent that we redeemed less than the number of shares that we could purchase in the third quarter of 2016. The Eighth Amended Share Redemption Program was effective on January 9, 2016. 
  Upon the death,  qualifying disability  or  determination of incompetence  of a stockholder, the redemption price is our estimated value per share. On December 8, 2015, our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of $13.44, based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities, or net asset value, divided by the number of shares outstanding as of September 30, 2015. The change in the redemption price became effective for the December 2015 redemption date and is effective until the estimated value per share is updated.  We expect to engage KBS Capital Advisors and/or an independent valuation firm to update our estimated value per share in December 2016. 
   (2)    We limit the dollar value of shares that may be redeemed under the program as described above. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we redeemed $31.5 million of common stock, which represented all redemption requests received in good order and eligible for redemption through the September 2016 redemption date. Based on the amount of net proceeds raised from the sale of shares under the dividend reinvestment plan during 2015 and additional funds made available by our board of directors, we have $7.1 million available for redemptions during the remainder of 2016, subject to the limitations described above.

The Company shall have the option to pay such fee in the form of cash, Shares, a promissory note or any combination of the foregoing. The Subordinated Incentive Fee will be reduced by the amount of any prior payment to the Advisor of a Subordinated Share of Cash Flows. In the event the Subordinated Incentive Fee is paid to the Advisor following Listing, no other performance fee will be paid to the Advisor.  In addition, the Subordinated Incentive Fee may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor.

  ARTICLE 11 
  RELATIONSHIP OF ADVISOR AND COMPANY; 
  OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE ADVISOR 
  11.01 Relationship.  The Company and the Advisor are not partners or joint venturers with each other, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to make them such partners or joint venturers. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Advisor from engaging in other activities, including, without limitation, the rendering of advice to other Persons (including other REITs) and the management of other programs advised, sponsored or organized by the Advisor or its Affiliates. Nor shall this Agreement limit or restrict the right of any manager, director, officer, employee or equityholder of the Advisor or its Affiliates to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other Person. The Advisor may, with respect to any investment in which the Company is a participant, also render advice and service to each and every other participant therein. The Advisor shall promptly disclose to the Board the existence of any condition or circumstance, existing or anticipated, of which it has knowledge, that creates or could create a conflict of interest between the Advisor s obligations to the Company and its obligations to or its interest in any other Person. 
  11.02 Time Commitment.  The Advisor shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents to, devote to the Company such time as shall be reasonably necessary to conduct the business and affairs of the Company in an appropriate manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the Advisor and its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents may also engage in activities unrelated to the Company and may provide services to Persons other than the Company or any of its Affiliates.

11.03 Investment Opportunities and Allocation.  The Advisor shall be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to present a continuing and suitable investment program to the Company that is consistent with the investment policies and objectives of the Company, but neither the Advisor nor any Affiliate of the Advisor shall be obligated generally to present any particular investment opportunity to the Company even if the opportunity is of character that, if presented to the Company, could be taken by the Company. In the event an investment opportunity is located, the allocation procedure set forth under the caption  Conflicts of Interest   Certain Conflict Resolution Measures   Allocation of Investment Opportunities  in the Registration Statement shall govern the allocation of the opportunity among the Company and Affiliates of the Advisor. 
  ARTICLE 12 
  THE KBS NAME 
  The Advisor and its Affiliates have a proprietary interest in the name  KBS.   The Advisor hereby grants to the Company a non-transferable, non-assignable, non-exclusive royalty-free right and license to use the name  KBS  during the term of this Agreement. Accordingly, and in recognition of this right, if at any time the Company ceases to retain the Advisor or one of its Affiliates to perform advisory services for the Company, the Company will, promptly after receipt of written request from the Advisor, cease to conduct business under or use the name  KBS  or any derivative thereof and the Company shall change its name and the names of any of its subsidiaries to a name that does not contain the name  KBS  or any other word or words that might, in the reasonable discretion of the Advisor, be susceptible of indication of some form of relationship between the Company and the Advisor or any its Affiliates.  At such time, the Company will also make any changes to any trademarks, servicemarks or other marks necessary to remove any references to the word  KBS.  Consistent with the foregoing, it is specifically recognized that the Advisor or one or more of its Affiliates has in the past and may in the future organize, sponsor or otherwise permit to exist other investment vehicles (including vehicles for investment in real estate) and financial and service organizations having  KBS  as a part of their name, all without the need for any consent (and without the right to object thereto) by the Company.

  (ii)    The Advisor or its Affiliates were acting on behalf of or performing services for the Company.  
  (iii)    Such liability or loss was not the result of  negligence or misconduct by the Advisor or its Affiliates.   
  15.03 Limitation on Payment of Expenses.  The Company shall pay or reimburse reasonable legal expenses and other costs incurred by the Advisor or its Affiliates in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding only if (in addition to the procedures required by the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time) all of the following are satisfied: (a) the proceeding relates to acts or omissions with respect to the performance of duties or services on behalf of the Company, (b) the legal proceeding was initiated by a third party who is not a stockholder or, if by a stockholder acting in his or her capacity as such, a court of competent jurisdiction approves such advancement and (c)  the Advisor or its Affiliates undertake to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the Company, together with the applicable legal rate of interest thereon, if it is ultimately determined that the particular indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification.
