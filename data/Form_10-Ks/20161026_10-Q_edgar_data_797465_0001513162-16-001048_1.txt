    STANLEY FURNITURE COMPANY, INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (unaudited)          1.         Preparation of Interim Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements          The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  In our opinion, these statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of all interim periods reported herein.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Certain information and footnote disclosures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States have been either condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations.  However, we believe that the disclosures made are adequate for a fair presentation of results of operations and financial position.  Operating results for the interim periods reported herein may not be indicative of the results expected for the year.  We suggest that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K.         Results of the discontinued operations are excluded from the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.         Certain amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.  These reclassifications do not have an impact on the consolidated statements of operations or the consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income.          2.          Property, Plant and Equipment                
            3.             Income taxes          During the first nine months of 2016, we expect to use approximately $19.7 million of our $40.1 million net operating loss carry-forwards against taxable income resulting from our surrender of corporate-owned life insurance policies.  The premiums paid and the growth in surrender value of these policies were excludable from taxable income over the life of these policies when held until death of the covered lives, but this growth, net of premiums paid, became taxable when we surrendered the policies.  The aggregate impact of the surrender of these policies in the first nine months of this year was $24.0 million in taxable income.  The income tax expense associated with the surrender of the corporate-owned life insurance policies was largely recognized during the first quarter when the policies were surrendered. The income tax expense recognized during the current three month period was the result of additional alternative minimum tax liability associated with the surrender of the corporate-owned life insurance policies and state income taxes.  The income tax expense recognized during the current nine month period was the result of federal alternative minimum tax and, to a lesser extent, the impact of surrendering these policies have on state income taxes.  During the first nine months of 2016, we reduced our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets from $19.2 million to $12.6 million at October 1, 2016, as a result of the use of a portion of our net operating loss carry-forwards.         6        
    STANLEY FURNITURE COMPANY, INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)     (unaudited)          3.              Income taxes (continued)          We maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that currently exceed our deferred tax liabilities.  The primary assets covered by this valuation allowance are net operating loss carry-forwards. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740,  Income Taxes , which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance.  Our results over the most recent three-year period were heavily affected by our business restructuring activities. Our cumulative loss, excluding income from the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act, in the most recent three-year period, in our view, represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance under the provisions of ASC 740,  Income Taxes . We intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal, resulting in no deferred tax asset balance being recognized. Should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged to income in the period such determination is made.         Our effective tax rates for the current three and nine month periods were negative 6.1% and negative 16.0%, respectively, driven by the impact of the alternative minimum tax and state related taxes on the surrender of corporate owned life insurance policies.  The effective tax rates in the prior year three and nine month periods were a benefit of 1.8% and an expense of 1.6%, respectively, also driven by the impact of the alternative minimum tax limiting the ability to offset the income received from the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act during those periods.  The major reconciling items between our effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate are the change in our valuation allowance and the cash surrender value on life insurance policies.          4.

Outstanding stock options and restricted stock are treated as potential common stock for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share.  Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated using the following share data (in thousands):

    STANLEY FURNITURE COMPANY, INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)     (unaudited)          5.             Stockholders  Equity (continued)          In the three and nine month periods ended October 1, 2016, the dilutive effect of stock options is not recognized since we had a net loss.  Approximately 1.2 million shares in the three and nine month periods of 2016 were issuable upon the exercise of stock options.  These were not included in the diluted per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive.  Also, 638,000 shares in 2016 of restricted stock were not included because they were anti-dilutive.  In the three and nine month periods ended September 26, 2015, approximately 1.4 million stock options were excluded from the diluted per share calculation as they would be anti-dilutive.         A reconciliation of the activity in stockholders  equity accounts for the first nine months ended October 1, 2016 is as follows (in thousands):          
            6.             Income from Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA)          We did not receive any CDSOA distributions in the 2016 three and nine month periods.  In the prior year nine month period, we recorded income of $4.9 million from CDSOA distributions previously withheld by U.S. Customs and Border Protection pending resolution of non-supporting producers  claims seeking to share in these distributions.               7.             Discontinued Operations          During the second quarter of 2014, we concluded that revenue on our Young America product line remained below the level needed to reach profitability and that the time frame needed to assure sustainable profitability was longer than we felt was economically justified.  Therefore, we made the decision to cease manufacturing operations at our Robbinsville, North Carolina facility and sell the related assets of this facility.  Manufacturing operations were ceased in the third quarter of 2014 and as a result this product line was reflected as a discontinued operation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08,  Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity  (ASU 2014-08) for all periods presented.            8        
    STANLEY FURNITURE COMPANY, INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)     (unaudited)          7.             Discontinued Operations (continued)          Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes, comprised the following (in thousands):          
       Loss from discontinued operations included write-down of inventories and other assets, severance and other termination costs and operating losses related to final manufacturing production.          8.             Corporate-owned Life Insurance Policies          In January 2016, we made the decision to liquidate two of our twenty-seven corporate-owned life insurance policies with cash surrender value of $2.6 million.  We used $2.5 million of the proceeds to pay down outstanding loans and accrued interest on corporate-owned life insurance policies, lowering our outstanding loan levels to $3.1 million.  In March 2016, we made the decision to liquidate the remaining twenty-five life insurance policies with cash surrender value of $25.6 million.  We received $22.4 million in proceeds on March 28, 2016, comprised of the cash surrender value net of $3.2 million in remaining outstanding loans and accrued interest.  The decision to liquidate was made after continued review of the financial stability of Genworth Life Insurance Company, the issuer of the policies.          9.             Subsequent Events          Subsequent to quarter end, we entered into a revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association that provides for maximum borrowings of $4.0 million and matures October 2018. The facility is secured by our accounts receivable, inventory and certain other assets. The facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 times with an initial compliance date at December 31, 2017.         As previously announced, the Board of Directors planned to declare an additional special dividend of $0.25 per share once we secured a revolving credit facility sufficient to fund fluctuations in working capital.  As a result of our securing the credit facility, the Board has declared a special dividend of $0.25 per share payable on November 18, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2016.         9        
        ITEM 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations            Results of Operations          The following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:          
       Net sales of $11.0 million for the three month period ended October 1, 2016, decreased $2.7 million, or 19.8%, compared to the comparable 2015 period.   For the nine month period ended October 1, 2016, net sales decreased $8.8 million, or 20.2%, from the comparable 2015 period.  The decrease in both periods was due to lower unit volume and lower average selling prices.  Lower unit volume was primarily a result of delays in shipping new product introduced in 2015 as the production ramp up of the new factory in Vietnam dedicated solely to our new product has taken longer than originally anticipated.  The initial orders of 2015 introductions are shipping and should begin to generate orders on retail floors in the near term.  Lower average selling prices are the result of aggressive discounting to move older discontinued product and also on inline product to achieve additional floor space to fuel future sales and generate cash while we prepare for sales from newer product.         Gross profit for the current three month period decreased to $1.8 million, or 16.6% of net sales, from $3.4 million, or 24.8% of net sales, for the comparable three months of 2015.  Gross profit for the current nine month period decreased to $6.4 million, or 18.5% of net sales, from $10.2 million, or 23.5% of net sales, for the comparable nine months of 2015.  The decrease in gross profit and gross margin in both the three and nine month periods was driven by lower sales volume, higher discounting and higher quality costs.  Partially offsetting the impact of these items in the three and nine month periods was lower ocean freight costs.  The prior year three and nine month periods contained higher freight costs resulting from West Coast port issues.         Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine month periods of 2016 were $3.8 million and $10.6 million, or 34.5% and 30.5% of net sales, respectively, compared to $2.8 million and $9.9 million, or 20.5% and 22.8% of net sales, in the comparable 2015 periods.  For the three month period, these expenses increased due to higher advertising and showroom costs, the decline in cash surrender value growth of corporate-owned life insurance policies due to the surrendering of these policies in the first quarter of 2016 and higher legal and professional expenses related to the engagement of Stephens Inc. to assist with an ongoing review of strategic and capital allocation opportunities.  Higher expenses in the nine month period were primarily due to the decline in cash surrender value growth of corporate-owned life insurance policies as we continued to pay down policy loans throughout 2015 and then the surrendering of these polices in the first quarter of this year.  The decline in cash surrender value growth of corporate-owned life insurance policies, net of expenses was $379,000 in the current three month period and $920,000 during the nine month period.  Approximately 60% of this growth was in selling, general and administrative expenses and the remaining 40% was in cost of goods sold.  The elimination of this growth is partially offset by the elimination of interest expense.  The higher selling, general and administrative percentages in the current year are due to higher expenditures and lower sales impairing absorption for fixed costs.         10        
       As a result, operating losses as a percentage of net sales were 17.9% for the current three month period and 12.0% for the current nine month period compared to income of 4.3% in the prior year three month period and 0.7% in the prior year nine month period.         During the prior year nine month period we recorded income of $4.9 million from the receipt of funds under the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA).  No proceeds were received in the current three and nine month periods.         Interest (income) expense for the three and nine month periods of 2016 decreased $222,000 and $653,000, respectively, from the comparable 2015 periods.  Interest expense is composed of interest on loans against cash surrender value of insurance policies used to fund our legacy deferred compensation plan.  The decrease in expense is due to paying down these outstanding loans with excess cash starting in late 2015 and eventually paying them off when we liquidated our corporate-owned life insurance policies in the first quarter of 2016.            Our effective tax rates for the current three and nine month periods were negative 6.1% and 16.0%, respectively.  As indicated above, we surrendered our corporate-owned life insurance policies during the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in taxable income for the period.  The premiums paid and the growth in surrender value of these policies were excludable from taxable income over the life of these polices when held until death of the covered lives, but this growth, net of premiums paid, became taxable when we surrendered the policies.  The aggregate impact of the surrender of these policies in the first quarter of this year was $24.0 million in taxable income.  The income tax expense associated with the surrender of the corporate-owned life insurance policies was largely recognized during the first quarter when the policies were surrendered. The income tax expense recognized during the current three month period was the result of additional alternative minimum tax liability associated with the surrender of the corporate-owned life insurance policies and state income taxes.  The income tax expense recognized during the current nine month period was the result of federal alternative minimum tax and, to a lesser extent, the impact of surrendering these policies have on state income taxes.  The effective tax rates in the prior year three and nine month periods were a benefit of 1.8% and an expense of 1.6%, respectively.  The income tax expense in the prior year nine month period was driven by the impact of the alternative minimum tax limiting the ability to offset the income received from the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act during the period.  The major reconciling items between our effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate are the change in our valuation allowance and the cash surrender value on life insurance policies.          Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources          Sources of liquidity include cash on hand and cash generated from operations. While we believe that our business strategy will be successful, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impact on our revenues, operating costs and cash flow from operations.  We expect cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit facility to be adequate for ongoing operational and capital expenditures over the next twelve months.  At October 1, 2016, we had $7.3 million in cash and $663,000 in restricted cash.         Working capital, excluding cash and restricted cash, decreased to $19.3 million at October 1, 2016 from $21.2 million on December 31, 2015.  The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of our lower sales volumes, an increase in other accrued expenses driven by accrued taxes and a decrease in prepaid and other assets.  Partially offsetting these factors was an increase in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable.         Cash used by operations was $3.2 million in the current nine months of 2016 compared to cash generated from operations of $2.5 million in the comparable prior year period.  The cash generation in 2015 was the result of receiving $4.9 million on CDSOA proceeds during the period. Excluding these proceeds, the cash use was approximately $700,000 higher in the current nine months of 2016 due to the increase in operating losses tied to lower sales volumes and product discounting and from higher tax payments on the taxable income from the surrender of our corporate-owned life insurance policies, partially offset by lower freight costs and lower interest payments on loans against corporate owned life insurance policies.         11        
       Cash generated from investing activities in the first nine months of 2016 was due to $28.1 million in proceeds from the surrender of corporate-owned life insurance policies.  Cash provided by investing activities was $527,000 in the prior year nine months with the release of restricted cash.           Net cash used by financing activities in the current nine months of 2016 was $24.1 million compared to $4.3 million in the comparable nine months of 2015.  During the current year we used $17.6 million for a special dividend, $5.5 million to pay off the remaining outstanding life insurance policy loans in conjunction with our decision to surrender these corporate-owned life insurance policies and $1.0 million for the repurchase and retirement of 400,000 shares of our common stock.  In the first nine months of 2015 we used $4.3 million to pay-down life insurance policy loans.         Subsequent to quarter end, we entered into a revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association that provides for maximum borrowings of $4.0 million and matures October 2018. The facility is secured by our accounts receivable, inventory and certain other assets. The facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 times with an initial compliance date at December 31, 2017. As previously announced, the Board of Directors planned to declare an additional special dividend of $0.25 per share once we secured a revolving credit facility sufficient to fund fluctuations in working capital.  As a result of our securing the credit facility, the Board has declared a special dividend of $0.25 per share payable on November 18, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2016.          Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act ( CDSOA )          The CDSOA provides for distribution of monies collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( Customs ) for imports covered by antidumping duty orders entering the United States through September 30, 2007 to eligible domestic producers that supported a successful antidumping petition ( Supporting Producers ) for wooden bedroom furniture imported from China. Antidumping duties for merchandise entering the U.S. after September 30, 2007 have remained with the U.S. Treasury.          In November 2015, Customs distributed $1.2 million in collected duties that were available for distribution in 2015.  Our portion of this distribution was $412,000, representing 33.6% of the balance available for distribution.  As of April 30, 2016, Customs preliminarily reported that approximately $3.2 million is potentially available for distribution under the CDSOA during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016 to eligible domestic manufacturers in connection with the case involving bedroom furniture imported from China.  The final amounts available for distribution may be higher or lower than the preliminary amounts reported due to liquidations, reliquidations, protests, and other events affecting entries that may take place before the end of the government s fiscal year.  Assuming our percentage allocation in 2016 is the same as it was for the 2015 distribution (approximately 33.6% of the funds distributed) and the $3.2 million collected by the government as of April 30, 2016 does not change, we could receive approximately $1.1 million in CDSOA funds in the fourth quarter of 2016.         Due to the uncertainty of the administrative processes, we cannot provide assurances as to future amounts of additional CDSOA funds that ultimately will be received, if any, and we cannot predict when we may receive any additional CDSOA funds.             New Accounting Pronouncements          In February 2016, the FASB issued its final lease accounting standard, FASB Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC"),  Leases  (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The standard is to be applied under the modified retrospective method, with elective reliefs, which requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented.         In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ).  The amendments in ASU 2016-09 simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The effective date for the standard for public entities is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.         12        
       In August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows  (Topic 230).  The guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The effective date for the standard for public entities is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, provided all amendments are adopted in the same period.  The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method.  We do not anticipate ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.          Critical Accounting Policies          There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.          Forward-Looking Statements          Certain statements made in this report are not based on historical facts, but are forward-looking statements.  These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as  believes,   estimates,   expects,   may,   will,   should,   could , or  anticipates,  or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy.  These statements reflect our reasonable judgment with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  Such risks and uncertainties include disruptions from transitioning  to and using a single contract manufacturer for substantially all of our products including those arising in the event the manufacturer is not able to manufacture as anticipated in terms of cost, quality or timeliness or in the event we lost this relationship, disruptions in foreign sourcing including those arising from supply or distribution disruptions or those arising from changes in political, economic and social conditions, as well as laws and regulations, in countries from which we source products, international trade policies of the United States and countries from which we source products, the inability to raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs, lower sales due to worsening of current economic conditions, the cyclical nature of the furniture industry, business failures or loss of large customers, failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes, fashions and perceived values in a timely manner, competition in the furniture industry, environmental, health, and safety compliance costs, and failure or interruption of our information technology infrastructure.  Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.          ITEM 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk           None of our foreign sales or purchases are denominated in foreign currency and we do not have any foreign currency hedging transactions.  While our foreign purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S. dollar could result in an increase in the cost of our products obtained from offshore sourcing and reduce our earnings or increase our losses, unless we are able to increase our prices for these items to reflect any such increased cost.          ITEM 4.   Controls and Procedures           (a)       Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).  Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.         (b)       Changes in internal controls over financial reporting.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.         13       
        ITEM 5.  Other Information            On October 25, 2016, the Company entered into a secured $6 million revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the  Lender ) with an excess availability requirement of $2 million resulting in maximum borrowings of $4.0 million under the facility, subject to borrowing base eligibility requirements.   The Credit Facility matures in October 2018 and is secured by the Company s accounts receivable, inventory and certain other assets pursuant to a Security Agreement (the  Security Agreement ) among the Company, Stanley Furniture Company 2.0, LLC, a Virginia limited liability company ( Stanley 2.0 ) and the Lender. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable per annum rate equal to the daily three month London Bank Interbank Offered Rate plus 3.5%.           The Credit Facility contains certain customary warranties, representations and affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that, among other things limits the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur certain types of debt or liens, pay dividends except for the additional $0.25 per share special dividend declared October 25, 2016, enter into mergers and consolidations or use proceeds of borrowing for other than permitted uses. The Credit Facility also include a covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio of not less than 1.10 to 1.0 with an initial compliance date at December 31, 2017.         The Credit Facility contains customary events of default for similar financing transactions, including (a) failure to make payments when due, (b) default in compliance with covenants in the Credit Facility or material contracts, (c) insolvency of the Company or Stanley 2.0, (d) the existence or occurrence of a Material Adverse Change as defined in the Credit Facility, or (e) if a person or group acquires more than 25% of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of the Company; however, the event of default in clause (e) will not arise if the Company provides written notice to the Lender within two business days after the Company becomes aware of such acquisition or an SEC filing is made with respect to such acquisition and, within 10 days after such notice, such person or group passes background checks required by the Lender and the Lender, in its sole discretion, consents to such acquisition.    Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, the Lender may declare amounts due under the Credit Facility immediately due and payable.          The Company s subsidiary, Stanley 2.0, has unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of the Company under the Credit Facility.          The foregoing description of the Credit Facility and the Security Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Facility and the Security Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are hereby incorporated by reference.          14

 EXHIBIT 10.1

Exhibit 10.1           Exhibit 10.1       CREDIT AGREEMENT       THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT (this " Agreement ") is entered into as of October 25, 2016 (the   Closing Date  ), by and between STANLEY FURNITURE COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation (  Borrower  ), and WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (" Lender "). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 7.1.  The parties agree as follows:        ARTICLE I     CREDIT TERMS        SECTION 1.1.     LINE OF CREDIT.       (a)     Line of Credit.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Lender agrees to make advances to Borrower under this Section 1.1 (  Advances  ), from time to time up to and including the Termination Date, in a total amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of (a) $6,000,000 (the   Maximum Revolver Amount  ), and (b) the Borrowing Base minus the Excess Availability Requirement, where the  Borrowing Base  shall mean the sum of the following:       (i)   up to eighty-five percent (85%) of Eligible Accounts,  plus        (ii)   the lowest of  (x)  $2,500,000, or (y) up to twenty five percent (25%) of the Value of Eligible Inventory and Eligible Letter of Credit Inventory, or (z) the amount calculated pursuant to clause (i) above;  less        (iii)    Letter of Credit Usage;  less        (iv)   all Reserves.       The Borrowing Base will be determined by Lender upon receipt and review of all collateral reports required under this Agreement and such other documents and collateral information as Lender may from time to time require, which documents and information are subject to change in the sole discretion of the Lender at any time from and after the Closing Date.  If at any time the Maximum Revolver Amount is less than the amount of the Borrowing Base, the amount of Advances available pursuant to this Section may be reduced by the amount of any Reserves established by Lender with respect to amounts that may be payable by any Borrower to third parties.    Line of Credit   means the line of credit established under this Section 1.1.   Account   means an account as that term is defined in the Code.   Account Debtor   means an account debtor as that term is defined the Code.   Inventory   means inventory as that term is defined in the Code.   Dilution   means, with respect to any period of determination selected by Lender, a percentage that is the result of dividing the dollar amount of the aggregate of all bad debt write-downs, discounts, allowances, credits, deductions and other dilutive items for such period as determined by Lender with respect to Borrower s Accounts for such period, by Borrower s billings with respect to Accounts for such period.  If Dilution at any time exceeds five percent (5%) of Borrower s gross sales for any such period, or if there at any time exists any other matters, events, conditions or contingencies which Lender reasonably believes may affect payment of any portion of Borrower s Accounts, Lender may, in its sole discretion, establish, and adjust from time to time, Reserves in the Borrowing Base.   Net Liquidation Percentage   means the percentage of the Value of Borrower s Inventory that is estimated by Lender to be recoverable in an orderly liquidation of such Inventory, which may be based upon the most recent appraisal received by, and acceptable to, Lender and upon which Lender may rely, net of all operating expenses and associated costs and expenses of such liquidation.   Reserves   means, as of any date of determination, an amount or percentage of a specific category or item that Lender establishes in its sole discretion from time to time to reduce availability under the Line of Credit to reflect events, conditions, contingencies, or risks which might affect the assets, business or prospects of the Borrower or any of the Collateral or its value or the enforceability, perfection or priority of Lender s security interest in the Collateral, including without limitation reserves for Dilution and Bank Products.   Value   means, as determined by Lender in good faith, with respect to Inventory, the lower of (a) cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis in accordance with GAAP, or (b) market value,  provided  that for purposes of the calculation of the Borrowing Base, the Value of Inventory will be computed in the same manner and consistent with the most recent appraisal of Inventory received and accepted by Lender, if any.   (b)   " Eligible Accounts " consist solely of Accounts created and invoiced by Borrower in the ordinary course of Borrower's business that arise out of the sale of goods or the rendition of services, upon which Borrower s right to receive payment is absolute and not contingent upon the fulfillment of any condition, and in which Lender has a perfected first-priority security interest, but will not include:       1

        (c)     Eligible Inventory   means all finished goods Inventory owned by Borrower and held for sale in the ordinary course of Borrower s business, in which Lender has a perfected first priority security interest, but will not include:       (i)        Inventory that is (A) in-transit, (B) located at any premises leased by Borrower or any warehouse, unless Lender has received a Collateral Access Agreement from such lessor or warehouseman, (C) located at job site or other premises not owned by Borrower other than premises permitted under (B) above, (D) covered by any negotiable or non-negotiable warehouse receipt, bill of lading or other document of title; (E) on consignment from any consignor or (F) on consignment to any consignee or subject to any bailment unless the consignee or bailee has executed such agreements with Lender in such form as Lender shall specify (and such other steps have been taken as required by Lender to ensure that Lender maintains a first priority perfected security interest in such Inventory at all times);       (ii)              supplies, parts, packing, packaging or shipping materials, or sample Inventory, tooling Inventory, fabricated parts, customer-supplied Inventory, or customized or customer specific Inventory not supported by a valid purchase order;       (iii)         work-in-process and raw materials Inventory;       (iv)             Inventory that is damaged, defective, obsolete, perishable, contaminated, discontinued, or slow moving, or that has been held by Borrower more than twenty-four (24) months without being sold, or that is not currently saleable in the ordinary course of Borrower s business, or is past its expiration date, has been rejected or the amount of such Inventory that has been reduced by shrinkage; provided, however, that (x) the aggregate Value of Inventory held by Borrower for more than twelve (12) months but less than twenty-four (24) months that may be included as Eligible Inventory in the Borrowing Base may not at any time exceed $500,000, and (y) Lender may exclude any inventory held by Borrower for more than twelve (12) months but less than twenty-four (24) months in respect for which Borrower has not demonstrated sales activity deemed adequate by Lender in its sole discretion;       (v)          Inventory that Borrower has returned, attempted to return, is in the process of returning or intends to return to the vendor of the Inventory, or inventory returned to Borrower;       (vi)          Inventory manufactured or held for resale by Borrower pursuant to a license unless the applicable licensor has agreed in writing to permit Lender to exercise its rights and remedies against such Inventory;       (vii)          Inventory consisting of bill and hold goods;       (viii)         Inventory stored at locations holding less than $200,000 of the aggregate Value of Borrower s Inventory;       (ix)         Inventory that is subject to a security interest or Lien in favor of any third party;       (x)          Inventory located outside of the United States; or       (xi)          Any other Inventory deemed ineligible by Lender in its Permitted Discretion.       (d)     Eligible Letter of Credit Inventory   means Inventory which would otherwise be Eligible Inventory (other than for its location) as to which: (i) the Inventory is purchased with and subject to a Letter of Credit issued hereunder; (ii) the Inventory is then in transit (whether by vessel, air or land) from a location outside of the United States of America) to a location permitted hereunder and for which Lender shall have received such evidence thereof as Lender may reasonably require; (iii) the title of the Inventory has passed to, and such Inventory is owned by, Borrower and for which Lender shall have received such evidence thereof as Lender may reasonably require; (iv) Lender has received each of the following: (A) a copy of the certificate of marine cargo insurance in connection therewith in which Lender has been named as an additional insured and lender loss payee in a manner reasonably acceptable to Lender and (B) a copy of the invoice, packing slip and manifest with respect thereto; (v) the Inventory is either (A) subject to a negotiable bill of lading: (1) that is consigned to Lender either directly or by means of endorsements), (2) that was issued by the carrier in respect of such Inventory, and (3) is either in the possession of the customs broker, freight forwarder or other third party handling the shipping and delivery of such Inventory acting on behalf of Lender or (B) subject to a negotiable cargo receipt and is not the subject of a bill of lading (other than a negotiable bill of lading consigned to, and in the possession of a consolidator or Lender, or their respective agents) and such negotiable cargo receipt is (1) consigned to Lender either directly or by means of endorsements, (2) issued by a consolidator in respect of such Inventory, and (3) either in the possession of Lender or the customs broker, freight forwarder or other third party handling the shipping and delivery of such Inventory acting on behalf of Lender; (vi) such Inventory is insured against types of loss, damage, hazards, and risks, and in amounts, reasonably satisfactory to Lender; and (vii) such Inventory shall not have been in transit for more than ninety (90) days.       3        
        (e)    Borrowing and Repayment .  Borrower may from time to time during the term of the Line of Credit request Advances, partially or wholly repay amounts outstanding under the Line of Credit, and reborrow the same, subject to all of the limitations, terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. Any request for Advance must be received by Lender no later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Business Day that funding is requested.  If at any time the aggregate outstanding Advances under the Line of Credit exceeds the lesser of (i) the Maximum Revolver Amount minus Letter of Credit Usage minus Reserves in accordance with Section 1.1(a) above or (ii) the Borrowing Base minus the Excess Availability Requirement, Borrower will immediately pay Lender such excess. No request for an Advance will be deemed received until Lender acknowledges the request.  All Advances will be repaid by Borrower even if the Person requesting the Advance on behalf of the Borrower lacks authorization.       (f)    Letter of Credit Subfacility .  As a subfacility under the Line of Credit, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Lender agrees during the term of this Agreement to issue or cause an Affiliate to issue documentary and/or standby letters of credit for the account of Borrower for general business purposes reasonably acceptable to Lender (" Letters of Credit "); provided however, (i) that the aggregate Letter of Credit Usage will not at any time exceed $700,000 and (ii) Lender shall have determined that there is Availability for any such Letter of Credit. The form and substance of each Letter of Credit will be subject to approval by Lender, in its sole discretion, and Borrower shall execute and deliver such additional letter of credit agreements, applications and other documents required by Lender as a condition to the issuance of any Letter of Credit.  Each Letter of Credit will be issued for a term not to exceed 365 days, as designated by Borrower; provided that no Letter of Credit will have an expiration date after the Maturity Date.  Each Letter of Credit will be issued under, and subject to, the additional terms and conditions of the letter of credit agreements, applications and any related documents required by Lender.  Each drawing paid under a Letter of Credit will be deemed an Advance under the Line of Credit and will be repaid by Borrower in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to such Advances; provided however, that if Advances under the Line of Credit are not available for any reason at the time any drawing is paid by Lender, then Borrower will immediately pay to Lender the full amount drawn, together with interest on such amount from the date such drawing is paid to the date such amount is fully repaid by Borrower, at the rate of interest applicable to Advances under the Line of Credit. In such event Borrower agrees that Lender may debit any account maintained by Borrower with Lender for the amount of any such drawing.   Letter of Credit Usage   means, as of any date, the sum of (i) the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, and (ii) the aggregate amount of outstanding reimbursement obligations with respect to Letters of Credit which remain unreimbursed or which have not been paid through a deemed Advance.       (g)    Protective Advances: Advances to Pay Obligations Due .  Lender may make Advances under the Line of Credit in its sole discretion for any reason at any time without Borrower s request and without Borrower s compliance with any of the conditions of this Agreement, and (i) disburse the proceeds directly to third Persons in order to protect Lender s interest in Collateral or to perform any of Borrower s obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) apply the proceeds to any Obligations then due and payable.       (h)    Payments; Lockbox and Collection Account .  All payments by Borrower will be made as directed by Lender or as otherwise specified in the other Loan Documents, without setoff, counterclaim or defense. Borrower will instruct all Account Debtors to make payments either directly to the lockbox established with Lender (the   Lockbox  ), for deposit by Lender directly to a deposit account established with Lender (the   Collection Account  ), or instruct them to deliver such payments to Lender by wire transfer, ACH, or other means as Lender may direct for deposit to the Lockbox or Collection Account or for direct application to reduce outstanding Advances or such other Obligations as Lender shall determine. All payments received by Lender will be applied to reduce outstanding Obligations in such manner as Lender determines in its sole discretion. If Borrower receives payment or the proceeds of Collateral directly, Borrower will promptly deposit the payment or proceeds into the Collection Account.  Until deposited, Borrower will hold all such payments and proceeds in trust for Lender without commingling with other funds or property. For purposes of calculating Availability, unless otherwise provided in any cash management or other agreement between Borrower and Lender, each payment will be applied to the Obligations as of the first Business Day following the Business Day of deposit to the Collection Account of immediately available funds or other receipt of immediately available funds by Lender, provided such payment is received in accordance with Lender s usual and customary practices as in effect from time to time. Any payment received by Lender that is not a transfer of immediately available funds will be considered provisional until the item or items representing such payment have been finally paid under applicable law. Should any payment item not be honored when presented for payment, then Borrower will be deemed not to have made such payment, and that portion of Borrower s outstanding Obligations corresponding to the amount of such dishonored payment item will be deemed to bear interest as if the dishonored payment item had never been received by Lender.  If Borrower is required to report its Borrowing Base on a weekly basis (or more frequently) in accordance with Schedule D hereto, then each reduction in outstanding Obligations resulting from the application of such payment to the outstanding Obligations will be accompanied by an equal reduction in the amount of outstanding Accounts included in the Borrowing Base, but if Borrower is required to report its Borrowing Base on a monthly basis in accordance with such Schedule D, then each reduction in outstanding Obligations resulting from the application of such payment to the outstanding Obligations will not be accompanied by an equal reduction in the amount of such outstanding Accounts.       4        
        (i)    Charges to Loan Account; Clearance Charge .  Lender will maintain an account on its books and records in the name of Borrower (the   Loan Account  ) in which will be recorded all Advances made by Lender, all Letters of Credit issued and all other payment Obligations. Borrower authorizes Lender to collect all principal, interest and fees due under the Line of Credit facility by charging the Loan Account, or any other deposit account maintained by Borrower with Lender. Should there be insufficient funds in the Loan Account or any such other account to pay all such sums when due, the full amount of such deficiency will be immediately due and payable by Borrower. All cash, checks, notes, instruments, and other items of payment (including insurance proceeds, cash proceeds of asset sales, rental proceeds, and tax refunds) (collectively,   Collections  ) received by Lender will be applied as provided in Section 1.1(h). All monthly statements relating to the Loan Account or such account will be conclusively presumed to be correct and accurate and constitute an account stated between Borrower and Lender unless Borrower delivers written objection to Lender within 30 days after receipt by Borrower. Obligations paid with Collections will continue to accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Advances for one Business Day following the Business Day that such Collections were applied to the Obligations.

Each Grantor hereby waives any objection or defense to the appointment of any such receiver and any right that such Grantor has or may have to seek the posting of a bond or other security by Lender.         5         
       While an Event of Default exists:                                           (1)             Each Grantor will deliver to Lender from time to time, as requested by Lender, current lists of all Collateral;                          (2)             No Grantor will dispose of any Collateral except on terms approved by Lender;                          (3)             at Lender's request, each Grantor will assemble and deliver all Collateral, and books and records pertaining thereto, to Lender at a reasonably convenient place designated by Lender; and                          (4)              Lender may, without notice to any Grantor, enter onto a Grantor's premises and take possession of the Collateral.           12.                   CUMULATIVE RIGHTS.  All rights, powers, privileges and remedies of Lender shall be cumulative.  No delay, failure or discontinuance of Lender in exercising any right, power, privilege or remedy hereunder shall affect or operate as a waiver of such right, power, privilege or remedy; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, privilege or remedy preclude, waive or otherwise affect any other or further exercise or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege or remedy.         13.                   WAIVERS AND CONSENTS OF LENDER.  Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind by Lender of any default, or any such waiver of any provisions or conditions, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent set forth in writing.                          14.                   DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL AND PROCEEDS; TRANSFER OF INDEBTEDNESS.  In disposing of Collateral, Lender may disclaim all warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment and the like.  Any proceeds of any disposition of any Collateral, may be applied by Lender to the payment of expenses incurred by Lender, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and the balance of such proceeds may be applied by Lender toward the payment of the Obligations in such order of application as Lender may from time to time elect. Upon the transfer of all or any part of the Obligations, Lender may transfer all or any part of the Collateral and shall be fully discharged from all liability and responsibility with respect to such transferred Collateral, and the transferee shall be vested with all rights and powers of Lender hereunder; but with respect to any Collateral not so transferred, Lender shall retain all rights, powers, privileges and remedies. It is agreed that public or private sales or other dispositions, for cash or on credit, to a wholesaler or retailer or investor, or user of property of the types subject to this Agreement, or public auctions, are all commercially reasonable since differences in the prices generally realized in the different kinds of dispositions are ordinarily offset by the differences in the costs and credit risks of such dispositions. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least 10 days  notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification and such notice shall constitute a reasonable  authenticated notification of disposition  within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the Code.  Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.  Lender may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time, and such sale may be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each Grantor agrees that the internet shall constitute a  place  for purposes of Section 9-610(b) of the Code. Each Grantor agrees that any sale of Collateral to a licensor pursuant to the terms of a license agreement between such licensor and such Grantor is sufficient to constitute a commercially reasonable sale (including as to method, terms, manner, and time) within the meaning of Section 9-610 of the Code. Each Grantor grants to Lender a non-exclusive, worldwide and royalty-free license to use or otherwise exploit all intellectual property rights of such Grantor for the purpose of: (a) completing the manufacture of any in-process materials following any Event of Default so that such materials become saleable Inventory, all in accordance with the same quality standards previously adopted by any Grantor for its own manufacturing; and (b) selling, leasing or otherwise disposing of any or all Collateral following any Event of Default.         15.                     GRANTOR NOT AN OBLIGOR.   If any Grantor is not a Borrower or Guarantor (an   Obligor  ) under some or all of the Obligations:                                         (a)   such  Grantor authorizes Lender, from time to time, without affecting such Grantor's obligations under this Agreement, to enter into an agreement with Obligor to change the interest rate on or renew the Obligations or other Indebtedness to Lender; accelerate, extend, compromise, or otherwise change the repayment terms or any other terms of the Obligations or such Indebtedness; receive and hold, exchange, enforce, waive, fail to perfect, substitute, or release Collateral, including collateral not originally covered by this Agreement; sell or apply any Collateral in any order; or release or substitute any borrower, guarantor or endorser of the Obligations or such Indebtedness, or other person.         6         
                       (b)   such  Grantor waives any defense by reason of any Obligor's or any other person's defense, disability, or release from liability .   Lender can exercise its rights against the Collateral even if any Obligor or any other person no longer is liable on the Obligations because of a statute of limitations or for other reasons.                                         (c)   such  Grantor agrees that it is solely responsible for keeping itself informed as to the financial condition of the Obligors and of all circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment . Such  Grantor waives any right it may have to require Lender to disclose to such Grantor any information which Lender may now or hereafter acquire concerning the financial condition of Obligors.                                         (d)   such  Grantor waives all rights to notices of default or nonperformance by Obligors .

(e)   Such  Grantor represents and warrants to Lender that it will derive benefit, directly and indirectly, from the collective administration and availability of credit under the Obligations . Such  Grantor agrees that Lender will not be required to inquire as to the disposition by any Obligor of funds disbursed by Lender.                                         (f)  Until all obligations to Lender under the Obligations have been paid in full and any commitments of Lender or facilities provided by Lender with respect to the Obligations have been terminated, such Grantor waives any right of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution (contractual, statutory or otherwise), including without limitation, any claim or right of subrogation under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any successor statute, which such Grantor may now or hereafter have against any Obligor with respect to the Obligations .  Such  Grantor waives any right to enforce any remedy which  Lender now has or may hereafter have against any Obligor, and waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security now or hereafter held by Lender.                         (g)   Such  Grantor waives any right to require Lender to proceed against any Obligor or any other person; proceed against or exhaust any security; or pursue any other remedy. Further, such Grantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Grantor under this Agreement or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Grantor.                         (h)  In the event any amount paid to Lender on any Obligations or any interest in property transferred to Lender as payment on any Obligations is subsequently recovered from Lender in or as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency or fraudulent conveyance proceeding, such Grantor shall be liable to Lender for the amounts so recovered up to the fair market value of the Collateral whether or not the Collateral has been released or the security interest terminated.  In the event the Collateral has been released or the security interest terminated, the fair market value of the Collateral shall be determined, at Lender's option, as of the date the Collateral was released, the security interest terminated, or said amounts were recovered.         16.                   STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.  Until all Obligations shall have been paid in full and all commitments by Lender to extend credit under the Credit Agreement have been terminated, the power of sale or other disposition and all other rights, powers, privileges and remedies granted to Lender shall continue to exist and may be exercised by Lender at any time and from time to time irrespective of the fact that the Obligations or any part thereof may have become barred by any statute of limitations, or that the personal liability of any Grantor may have ceased, unless such liability shall have ceased due to the payment in full of all Obligations and Indebtedness secured by this Agreement.         17.                   WAIVERS OF GRANTORS.  Each  Grantor waives any right to require Lender to (a) proceed against any Grantor or any other Person, (b) marshal assets or proceed against or exhaust any security from any Grantor or any other Person, (c) perform any obligation of any Grantor with respect to any Collateral; and (d)    make any presentment or demand, or give any notice of nonpayment or nonperformance, protest, notice of protest or notice of dishonor hereunder or in connection with any Collateral or Proceeds.  Each Grantor further waives any right to direct the application of payments or security for any Indebtedness of such Grantor or indebtedness of customers of such Grantor.         18.

If any Grantor refuses or fails to execute or deliver any requested Additional Documents, such Grantor authorizes Lender to execute such Additional Documents in such Grantor s name, and authorizes Lender to file such executed Additional Documents in any appropriate filing office.   Each Grantor acknowledges that no Grantor is authorized to file any financing statement or amendment with respect to any financing statement filed in connection with this Agreement without the prior written consent of Lender, subject to such Grantor s rights under Section 9-509(d)(2) of the Code.                               7         
               20.                   SUBROGATION RIGHTS.  Until all Obligations shall have been paid in full and all commitments by Lender to extend credit under the Credit Agreement have been terminated, no Grantor shall have any right of subrogation or contribution or similar right, and each Grantor waives any benefit of or right to participate in any of the Collateral or any other security now or subsequently held by Lender.         21.
