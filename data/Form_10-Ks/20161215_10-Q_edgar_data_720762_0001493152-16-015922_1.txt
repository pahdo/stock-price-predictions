    NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  

  October
31, 2016  

The
following (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2016, which has been derived from audited financial statements,
and (b) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by Non-Invasive Monitoring
Systems, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the  Company  or  NIMS ) in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions
to the quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These statements reflect adjustments, all of which are of a
normal, recurring nature, and which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial
position as of October 31, 2016, and results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.
The results of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full
year. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have
been condensed or omitted. The Company s accounting policies continue unchanged from July 31, 2016. These condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2016.  

1.     ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS    

Organization.
  Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc., a Florida corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the  Company 
or  NIMS ), began business as a medical diagnostic monitoring company to develop computer-aided continuous monitoring
devices to detect abnormal respiratory and cardiac events using sensors on the human body s surface. It has ceased to operate
in this market and has licensed the rights to its technology. The Company now focuses on developing and marketing its Exer-Rest  
 line of acceleration therapeutic platforms based upon unique, patented whole body periodic acceleration ( WBPA )
technology. The Exer-Rest line of acceleration therapeutic platforms currently includes the Exer-Rest AT3800 and AT4700 models.  

Business.
  The Company is developing and marketing its Exer-Rest    line of acceleration therapeutic platforms based
upon unique, patented whole body periodic acceleration ( WBPA ) technology. The Exer-Rest line of acceleration therapeutic
platforms currently includes the Exer-Rest AT3800 and AT4700 models.  

During
the calendar years 2005 to 2007, the Company designed, developed and manufactured the first Exer-Rest platform (now the Exer-Rest
AT), a second generation acceleration therapeutics platform, and updated its operations to promote the Exer-Rest AT overseas as
an aid to improve circulation and joint mobility and to relieve minor aches and pains.   

The
Company has developed a third generation of Exer-Rest acceleration therapeutic platforms (designated the Exer-Rest AT3800 and
the Exer-Rest AT4700) that had been manufactured by Sing Lin Technologies Co. Ltd. ( Sing Lin ) based in Taichung,
Taiwan (see Note 10). In fiscal year 2009, NIMS began commercial sales of its third generation Exer-Rest therapeutic platforms.  

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming it will continue
as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had net
losses of approximately $127,000 and $94,000 for the three month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and has experienced cash outflows from operating activities. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of $25.6 million as of
October 31, 2016, and has potential purchase obligations at October 31, 2016 (see note 10). The Company had $59,000 of cash at
October 31, 2016 and negative working capital of approximately $2.9 million. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.  

Absent
any significant revenues from product sales, the Company will need to incur additional debt, equity financing or a strategic collaboration
for the Company to continue its business activities. Management intends to obtain any additional capital needed to continue its
business activities through new debt or equity financing, but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in this regard.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

  NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  

  October
31, 2016  

2.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Consolidation.
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems of Florida, Inc., which has no current operations, and NIMS of Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation,
which has no current operations. All material inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates.   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as accounts receivable,
inventory valuation, stock based compensation, warranty accrual and deferred taxes as estimates, that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such items include input variables for stock
based compensation, accounts receivable, inventory valuation, warranty accrual and deferred taxes. Actual results could differ
materially from these estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents.   The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with an original maturity
date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had approximately $59,000 and $87,000 on checking accounts at
October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016, respectively.  

Allowances
for Doubtful Accounts.   Receivables are recorded at the stated amount of the transactions. The Company provides an allowance
for receivables it believes it may not collect in full. Receivables are written off when they are deemed to be uncollectible and
all collection attempts have ceased. The amount of bad debt recorded each period and the resulting adequacy of the allowance at
the end of each period are determined using a combination of the Company s historical loss experience, customer-by-customer
analysis of the Company s accounts receivable each period and subjective assessments of the Company s future bad debt
exposure.  

Inventories.
  Inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method, and are evaluated
at least annually for impairment. Inventories at October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016 primarily consisted of finished Exer-Rest
units and accessories. Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory are made based on management s analysis
of inventory levels and historical obsolescence. Since July 31, 2016 the Company has classified its inventories as non-current
to reflect the extended time frame the Company expects to sell the inventory. 

Taxes
Assessed on Revenue-Producing Transactions.   The Company presents sales taxes assessed on revenue-producing transactions
between a seller and customer using the net presentation; thus, sales and cost of revenues are not affected by such taxes.  

Income
Taxes.   The Company provides for income taxes using an asset and liability based approach. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The deferred tax asset for loss carryforwards and other
potential future tax benefits has been fully offset by a valuation allowance since it is uncertain whether any future benefit
will be realized. The utilization of the loss carryforward is limited to future taxable earnings of the Company and may be subject
to severe limitations if the Company undergoes an ownership change pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Tax years
ranging from 2013 to 2016 remain open to examination by various taxing jurisdictions as the statute of limitations has not expired.
It is the Company s policy to include income tax interest and penalty expense in its tax provision.  

Revenue
Recognition.   Revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the goods are
shipped and title has transferred, the price is fixed or determinable, and the collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably
assured. The Company recognizes royalties as they are earned, based on reports from licensees. Research and consulting revenue
and revenue from sales of extended warranties on therapeutic platforms are recognized over the term of the respective agreements.  

Advertising
Costs.   The Company expenses all costs of advertising and promotions as incurred. There were no advertising and promotional
costs incurred for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  

Research
and Development Costs.   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, and primarily consist of payments to third
parties for research and development of the Exer-Rest device and regulatory testing and other costs to obtain FDA approval.  

Warranties.
  The Company s warranties are two years on all Exer-Rest products sold domestically and one year for products sold
outside of the U.S. and are accrued based on management s estimates and the history of warranty costs incurred. There were
no material warranty costs incurred during the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, and management estimates that the
Company s accrued warranty expense at October 31, 2016 will be sufficient to offset claims made for units under warranty.

Stock-based
compensation.   The Company recognizes all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, as operating expenses,
based on their grant date fair values. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting life of the underlying
stock options and is included in selling, general and administrative costs and expenses in the condensed consolidated comprehensive
statements of operations for all periods presented.   

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments.   Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent
information available to management as of October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet
financial instruments such as cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair values because they are
short term in nature or they bear current market interest rates.  

As
of October 31, 2016, the respective carrying value of the notes payable   related party and notes payable   other
approximate our current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable maturity and are considered Level 3 measurements
within the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are those that are unobservable and significant to
the fair value measurement.  

Foreign
Currency Translation.   The functional currency for the Company s foreign subsidiary is the local currency. Assets
and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date while income and expense amounts are translated
at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are disclosed as a separate
component of stockholders  deficit and other comprehensive loss. There were no foreign currency translation adjustments
for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  

Comprehensive
Income (Loss).   Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period
from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including foreign currency translations.  

Loss
Contingencies.   We recognize contingent losses that are both probable and estimable. In this context, we define probability
as circumstances under which events are likely to occur. In regards to legal costs, we record such costs as incurred.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements.   In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which affects the revenue recognition
of entities that enter into either (1) certain contracts to transfer goods or services to customers or (2) certain contracts for
the transfer of nonfinancial assets. The update indicates an entity should recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration
the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services transferred by the entity. The update is to be applied
to the beginning of the year of implementation or retrospectively and is effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2017 and in interim periods in that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect the update will have on its financial statements.  

3.     INVENTORIES   

The
Company s inventory consisted of the following at October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016 (in thousands):  

The
Company recorded inventory valuation impairment adjustments of $327,000 for the year ended July 31, 2016. The $327,000
inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended July 31, 2016 is related to management s year-end business review and
related assessment of the net realizable value of the Exer-Rest units. Factors in this determination included the age of inventory,
recent historical sales, and the uncertainty of when the Company would have a sales team, either internal or through an alliance
or collaboration, for the Exer-Rest. Previous to year end, factors similar to those above led management to conclude that inventory
was recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value (or lower-of-cost or market for previous years). Given the change in
circumstances around year end which included a lower likelihood of having a sales force, management reassessed its determination
and recorded a provision on inventory. Additionally the inventory adjustment includes spare parts and a single used Exer-Rest
unit that is no longer in the possession of the Company.

  October

A
summary of the inventory valuation adjustment consists of the following (in thousands):  

Inventory 
 Valuation 
 Adjustment     
 
     Finished goods including landing costs    
     $  313     
 
     Spare parts

     Used inventory    
        3     
 
     Total inventory valuation adjustment    
     $  327     

Although
it does not plan to do so, if the Company were to dispose of the inventory outside the normal course of business, the amount recovered
by the Company may likely be substantially less than the carrying value.  

4.     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   

The
Company measures the cost of employee, officer and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based
on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of the Company s stock option awards is expensed over the vesting
life of the underlying stock options using the graded vesting method, with each tranche of vesting options valued separately.
The Company recorded stock-based compensation of $0 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  

The
Company s 2000 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the  2000 Plan ), provides for the issuance of up to 2,000,000
shares of the Company s common stock. The 2000 Plan allows the issuance of incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights
and restricted stock awards. The exercise price of the options is determined by the compensation committee of the Company s
Board of Directors, but incentive stock options, if any, must be granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value
of the Company s common stock as of the grant date or an exercise price of not less than 110% of the fair value for a 10%
shareholder. Options expire up to ten years from the date of the grant and are exercisable according to the terms of the individual
option agreements. The 2000 Plan expired on March 1, 2012. No additional grants may be made under the 2000 Plan; however, previously
granted options will remain in force pursuant to the terms of the individual grants.  

In
November 2010, the Company s Board and Compensation Committee approved the Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. 2011 Stock
Incentive Plan (the  2011 Plan ). Awards granted under the 2011 Plan may consist of incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights (SAR), restricted stock grants, restricted stock units (RSU) performance shares, performance units or cash
awards. Subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, the 2011 Plan authorizes up to 4,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock for issuance pursuant to the terms of the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan was approved by our shareholders in March 2012
and no awards have been granted under the 2011 Plan as of October 31, 2016.  

The
Company did not grant any stock options during the three months ended October 31, 2016 or 2015.

31, 2016  

A
summary of the Company s stock option activity for the three months ended October 31, 2016 is as follows:  

Of
the 200,000 options outstanding at October 31, 2016, all were issued under the 2000 Plan and none were issued outside of shareholder
approved plans. There were no options exercised during the three month periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. There were no
options forfeited or expired during the three month periods ending October 31, 2016 and 2015.  

As
of October 31, 2016, there was no unrecognized costs related to outstanding stock options.  

5.     ROYALTIES   

The
Company is a party to two licensing agreements with SensorMedics and VivoMetrics. The Company previously received royalty income
from the sale of its diagnostic monitoring hardware and software from SensorMedics and previously received royalties from VivoMetrics
prior to its bankruptcy.  

There
was no royalty income from the SensorMedics license for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. SensorMedics indicated
they will discontinue licensed product sales after inventory is depleted. We believe SensorMedics inventory is depleted and, therefore,
we do not anticipate any future royalty revenue from SensorMedics. There were no royalties recognized from VivoMeterics for the
three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. VivoMetrics ceased operations in July 2009 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
in October 2009. Under VivoMetrics  approved bankruptcy plan of reorganization, our license with VivoMetrics was assigned
to another company; however, there can be no assurance as to the future amount of royalty income, if any, that may result from
this license or from our existing license with SensorMedics.

At
October 31, 2016, the Company was obligated under the above described Credit Facility and promissory notes to make future principal
payments (excluding interest) as follows:  

7.     SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY   

The
Company has three classes of Preferred Stock. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred
Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of common stock as a single class on all matters.  

Series
B Preferred Stock is not redeemable by the Company and has a liquidation value of $100 per share, plus declared and unpaid dividends,
if any. Dividends are non-cumulative, and are at the rate of $10 per share, if declared.  

Series
C Preferred Stock is redeemable by the Company at a price of $0.10 per share upon 30 days prior written notice. This series has
a liquidation value of $1.00 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends, if any. Dividends are non-cumulative, and are at the
rate of $0.10 per share, if declared. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into 25 shares of the Company s
common stock upon payment of a conversion premium of $4.20 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and the conversion premium
are subject to adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits and certain other events.  

Series
D Preferred Stock is not redeemable by the Company. This series has a liquidation value of $1,500 per share, plus declared and
unpaid dividends, if any. Each share of Series D Preferred Stock is convertible into 5,000 shares of the Company s common
stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits and certain
other events.  

The
Company did not issue any shares of the Company s common stock during the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  

No
preferred stock dividends were declared for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  

8.     BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE   

Basic
net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential
common shares that were outstanding during the period. Diluted potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable
upon exercise of stock options and warrants and conversion of preferred stock. In computing diluted net loss per share for the
three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, no dilution adjustment has been made to the weighted average outstanding common
shares because the assumed exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the conversion of preferred stock would be anti-dilutive.

10.     COMMITMENTS    

Leases .  

The Company is under an
operating lease agreement for our corporate office space that expired in 2012 and currently continues on a month to month
basis at no cost. 

We
house our inventory in approximately 4,000 square feet of warehouse space in Pembroke Park, Florida. The lease commenced September
15, 2014 and originally expired on September 30, 2015 and we have exercised our option to renew that extended the expiration to
September 15, 2017.  

Generally,
the lease agreements require the payment of base rent plus escalations for increases in building operating costs and real estate
taxes. Rental expense for operating leases amounted to $11,000 and $14,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  

Future
minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable leases are as approximately follows for the years ended July 31:  

Product
Development and Supply Agreement.   

On
September 4, 2007, the Company entered into a Product Development and Supply Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Sing
Lin Technologies Co. Ltd., a company based in Taichung, Taiwan ( Sing Lin ). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company
consigned to Sing Lin the development and design of the next generation Exer-Rest and related devices. The Agreement commenced
as of September 3, 2007 and had a term that extended three years from the acceptance by NIMS of the first run of production units.
Thereafter, the Agreement automatically renewed for successive one year terms unless either party sent the other a notice of non-renewal.
Either party was permitted to terminate the Agreement with ninety days prior written notice. Upon termination, each party s
obligations under the Agreement were to be limited to obligations related to confirm orders placed prior to the termination date.  

Pursuant
to the Agreement, Sing Lin designed, developed and manufactured the tooling required to manufacture the acceleration therapeutic
platforms for a total cost to the Company of $471,000. Sing Lin utilized the tooling in the performance of its production obligations
under the Agreement. The Company paid Sing Lin $150,000 of the tooling cost upon execution of the Agreement and $150,000 upon
the Company s approval of the product prototype concepts and designs. The balance of the final tooling cost became due and
payable in September 2008 upon acceptance of the first units produced using the tooling, and was paid in full during the year
ended July 31, 2009.  

Under
the now-terminated Agreement, the Company also granted Sing Lin the exclusive distribution rights for the products in certain
countries in the Far East, including Taiwan, China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and certain other countries. Sing
Lin agreed not to sell the Products outside its geographic areas in the Far East.  

The
Agreement provided for the Company to purchase approximately $2.6 million of Exer-Rest units within one year of the September
2008 acceptance of the final product. The Agreement further provided for the Company to purchase $4.1 million and $8.8 million
of Exer-Rest products in the second and third years following such acceptance, respectively. These minimum purchase amounts were
based upon 2007 product costs multiplied by volume commitments. Through October 31, 2016, the Company had paid Sing Lin $1.7 million
in connection with orders placed through that date. Of this amount, $90,000 was previously included as advances to contract manufacturer.
As of October 31, 2016, the Company has approximately $41,000 of payables due to Sing Lin. As of October 31, 2016 and July 31,
2016, aggregate minimum future purchases under the Agreement totaled approximately $13.9 million.  

As
of October 31, 2016, the Company had not placed orders sufficient to meet the first-year or second-year minimum purchase obligations
under the Agreement. The Company notified Sing Lin in June 2010 that it was terminating the Agreement effective September 2010,
and Sing Lin in July 2010 demanded that the Company place orders sufficient to fulfill the three year minimum purchase obligations
in the Agreement. As of October 31, 2016, Sing Lin has not followed up on its July 2010 demand. There can be no assurance that
Sing Lin will not attempt to enforce its remedies under the Agreement, or pursue other potential remedies.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK   

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to risk consist principally of cash, royalties and other receivables, and purchases
and advances to contract manufacturer.  

Cash.
 The Company does not have cash deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) limit.  

Inventories:
 The provision on inventory is an estimate based on multiple factors as further described in Note 3. The ultimate realization
of the inventory amounts may be materially different. During 2016, the Company did not renew its FDA registration for the Exer-Rest
and as of the date of these financial statement, the Company had started the process to renew its registration and does not anticipate
any significant delays or effects on operations. If the registration were to be rejected or significantly delayed, the Company s
sales could be affected. Also, during 2016, the Company did not renew its International Organization for standardization ( ISO )
certification which could prevent sales from being permitted in Europe and other areas that may require ISO certification. The
Company does not anticipate this will significantly affect its expected revenues, in part because the Company does not anticipate
significant potential future revenues from Europe.  

Royalties
and Other Receivables.  The Company currently grants credit to a limited number of customers, substantially all of whom are
corporations and medical providers located throughout the United States and Canada. The Company typically does not require collateral
from these customers.  

Purchases
from and Advances to Contract Manufacturer.  Substantially all of the Company s current inventory has been acquired from
Sing Lin pursuant to the now-terminated Agreement. The Company notified Sing Lin in June 2010 that it was terminating the agreement
effective September 2010. If the Company is unable to establish a contract and obtain a sufficient alternative supply from Sing
Lin or another supplier, it may not be able to procure additional inventory on a timely basis or in the quantities required. Sing
Lin and its subcontractors currently maintain custody of the Company s specialized tooling, which could adversely impact
the Company s ability to reallocate production to other vendors.  

Major
Customers.  Substantially all of the Company s revenue for the year ended July 31, 2016 resulted from sales from 1 customer
who was a distributor outside the United States. There is no guarantee such sales will be made in the future to this customer.
Sales to foreign distributors generally require prepayment by such distributors or letter of credit guarantees in respect of payments
by such distributors.

Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-looking Statements .    

This
Interim Report on Form 10-Q contains, in addition to historical information, certain forward-looking statements regarding Non-Invasive
Monitoring Systems, Inc. (the  Company  or  NIMS,  also referred to as  us ,  we 
or  our ). These forward-looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning the Company s operations,
performance, financial condition, business strategies, and other information and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
For this purpose, any statements contained in this Report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking
statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as  may,   will,   expect, 
 believe,   anticipate,   intend,   could,   estimate,  or  continue 
or the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The
Company s actual results of operations, some of which are beyond the Company s control, could differ materially from
the activities and results implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to the Company s: history of operating losses and accumulated deficit; immediate need for additional
financing; the Company s inability to repay the Credit Facility currently due on July 31, 2017 or promissory notes due on
July 31, 2017, dependence on future sales of the Exer-Rest    motion platforms; current and future purchase commitments;
competition; dependence on management; changes in healthcare rules and regulations; risks related to proprietary rights; government
regulation, including regulatory approvals; other factors described herein as well as the factors contained in  Item 1A
- Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2016. We do not undertake any obligation to
update forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are only predictions
and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance.   

Overview   

We
are primarily engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of non-invasive, whole body periodic acceleration ( WBPA )
therapeutic platforms, which are motorized platforms that move a subject repetitively head to foot. Our acceleration therapeutic
platforms are the inventions of Marvin A. Sackner, M.D., our founder, former Chief Executive Officer and a current member of our
Board of Directors. Over thirty peer reviewed scientific publications attest to the benefits of whole body periodic acceleration
in animal and human research investigations. According to those studies, the application of this technology causes increased release
of beneficial substances such as nitric oxide from the inner lining of blood vessels throughout the vasculature for improved circulation
and the reduction of inflammation. These findings are not being claimed as an intended use of the device for marketing purposes,
but demonstrate a potential mechanism for its benefits.  

The
development and commercialization of the Exer-Rest has necessitated substantial expenditures and commitments of capital, and we
anticipate expenses and associated losses to continue for the foreseeable future. We will be required to raise additional capital
to fulfill our business plan, but no commitment to raise such additional capital exists or can be assured. We are also examining
strategic alternatives. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to expand sales and/or raise capital, or some other strategic alternative,
we will not be able to continue operations.

Whole
Body Periodic Acceleration ( WBPA ) Therapeutic Devices   

The
original AT-101 was a comfortable gurney-styled device that provided movement of a platform repetitively in a head-to-foot motion
at a rapid pace. Sales of the AT-101 commenced in October 2002 in Japan and in February 2003 in the United States. QTM Incorporated
( QTM ), an FDA registered manufacturer located in Oldsmar, Florida, manufactured the device, which was built in accordance
with ISO and current Good Manufacturing Practices. As discussed above, we ceased manufacturing and selling the AT-101 in the United
States in January 2005 as we began development of the Exer-Rest AT. We continued selling our existing inventory of AT-101 devices
overseas until the Exer-Rest AT became available in October 2007, at which time we discontinued marketing of the AT-101.  

The
Exer-Rest AT is based upon the design and concept of the AT-101, but has the dimensions and appearance of a commercial extra long
twin bed. The Exer-Rest AT, which was also manufactured by QTM until we stopped production in July 2009, weighs about half as
much as the AT-101, has a much more efficient and less costly drive mechanism, has a much lower selling price than did the AT-101
and is designed such that the user can utilize and operate it without assistance. The wired hand held controller provides digital
values for speed, travel and time, rather than analog values for speed and arbitrary force values as in the AT-101. Sales of the
Exer-Rest AT began outside the United States in October 2007 and in the United States in February 2009. We discontinued manufacturing
of the Exer-Rest AT in July 2009, and we no longer have any of these units available.

The
Exer-Rest AT3800 and Exer-Rest AT4700, which were manufactured for us by Sing Lin prior to the termination of our agreement with
them, are next generation versions of the Exer-Rest AT and further advance the acceleration therapeutic platform technology. The
AT3800 (38  wide) and AT4700 (47  wide) models combine improved drive technology for quieter operation, a more comfortable
 memory-foam  mattress, more convenient operation with a multi-function wireless remote and a more streamlined look
to improve the WBPA experience. Sales of the Exer-Rest AT3800 and Exer-Rest AT4700 platforms began outside the United States in
October 2008, and U.S. sales commenced in February 2009.  

LifeShirt      

The
LifeShirt is a patented Wearable Physiological Computer that incorporates transducers, electrodes and sensors into a sleeveless
garment. These sensors transmit vital and physiological signs to a miniaturized, battery-powered, electronic module which saves
the raw waveforms and digital data to the compact flash memory of a Personal Digital Assistant ( PDA ) attached to
the LifeShirt. Users of the LifeShirt can enter symptoms (with intensity), mood and medication information directly into the PDA
for integration with the physiologic information collected by the LifeShirt garment. The flash memory can then be removed from
the LifeShirt and the data uploaded and converted into minute-by-minute median trends of more than 30 physical and emotional signs
of health and disease. Vital and physiological signs can therefore be obtained non-invasively, continuously, cheaply and reliably
with the comfortably worn LifeShirt garment system while resting, exercising, working or sleeping. The LifeShirt was sold exclusively
by VivoMetrics, but has not been marketed since VivoMetrics ceased operations in July 2009. Under VivoMetrics  approved
bankruptcy plan of reorganization, our license with VivoMetrics was assigned to another company; however, there can be no assurance
as to the future amount of LifeShirt sales, if any, that may result from this license.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates     

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below under  Results of Operations 
and  Liquidity and Capital Resources  should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto
appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounts receivable, inventory,
property and equipment, intangible assets, contingencies and litigation. Regarding inventories, the provision is an estimate based
on multiple factors as further described in Notes 2 and 3. The ultimate realization of the inventory amount may be materially
different. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting
policies can be found in Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K. While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound
accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates
requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates.  

Results
of Operations    

In
January 2005, we began developing the Exer-Rest line of acceleration therapeutic platforms, which were designed to be more efficient
and less expensive than the original AT-101 platform. The Exer-Rest AT platform was first available for delivery to certain locations
outside of the United States in October 2007. Our newest platforms, the Exer-Rest AT3800 and AT4700, which we developed under
our former agreement with Sing Lin, became available for sale in October 2008. In January 2009, the Exer-Rest line of therapeutic
platforms was registered by the FDA in the United States as Class I (Exempt) Medical Devices. During 2016, we did not renew our
FDA registration for the Exer-Rest and as of the date of these financial statement, the Company had started the process to renew
its registration and does not anticipate any significant delays or effects on operations.  

We
began our US and international sales activity with aggressive marketing and promotional pricing beginning in February 2009. We
opened our first demonstration and therapy center in Toronto, Canada in April 2009; however we closed that facility in January
2010 to focus our marketing and sales efforts on healthcare providers as well as individuals. We currently market the Exer-Rest
to hospitals, cardiac rehabilitation clinics, chiropractic and physical therapy centers, senior living communities and other healthcare
providers, as well as to their patients, professional athletes and other individuals.

Three
months ended October 31, 2016 compared to three months ended October 31, 2015     

Revenues.
 Total revenues decreased to $0 for the three months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to $8,000 for the three months ended
October 31, 2015. This $8,000 decrease resulted from the sale of an Exer-Rest unit during the three months ended October 31, 2015
as compared to none sold during the three months ended October 31, 2016.  

Cost
of Sales.  Cost of sales for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $3,000, respectively. This $3,000
decrease resulted from the sale of an Exer-Rest unit during the three months ended October 31, 2015 as compared to none sold during
the three months ended October 31, 2016.  

Selling, general and
administrative costs and expenses.  Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) costs and expenses increased
to $79,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 from $59,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2015. This $20,000
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional fee accruals related to the timing of invoices and partially
offset with a reduction in legal fees. 

Research
and development costs and expenses.  There was no Research and development ( R D ) costs and expenses for the
three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  

Total
operating costs and expenses.  Total operating costs and expenses increased to $79,000 for the three months ended October 31,
2016 from $54,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2015. This $25,000 increase was primarily attributable to the increased
SG A costs and expenses discussed above.  

Other
expense . Other expense was $48,000 and $40,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $8,000
increase was primarily related to an increase in interest expense resulting from the addition of interest bearing promissory notes
entered into by the Company (see Note 6).  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources     

The
Company s operations have been primarily financed through private sales of its equity securities and advances under Credit
Facility and promissory notes. At October 31, 2016, we had approximately $59,000 of cash and negative working capital of approximately
$2,971,000. We believe that the cash on hand at October 31, 2016 will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements
for operations over the next 12 months.  

We
expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future. It is likely that we will not be able to generate significant
additional revenue and we will be required to obtain additional external financing through public or private equity offerings,
debt financings or collaborative agreements to continue operations. No assurance can be given that such additional financing will
be available on acceptable terms or at all. We are also examining strategic alternatives. Our ability to sell additional shares
of our stock and/or borrow cash could be materially adversely affected by the current climate in the global equity and credit
markets. Current economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile and continued instability in these market conditions
may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business and to replace, in a timely manner, maturing
liabilities or to successfully examine strategic alternatives. Additionally, the sales of equity or convertible debt securities
may result in dilution to our stockholders.  

Net cash used in operating
activities was $28,000 and $70,000 for three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This $42,000 decrease
is primarily due to higher accrual of accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the three months ended October 31, 2015
compared to the three months ended October 31, 2016. 

No
cash was used or provided by investing activities for three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $0 and $125,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The $125,000 increase was a result of the $125,000 related party promissory notes (see Note 6).  

2010
Credit Facility.  On March 31, 2010, the Company entered into a new Note and Security Agreement with Frost Gamma Investments
Trust, a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, which beneficially owns in excess of 10% of the Company s common stock ( Frost
Gamma ), and Hsu Gamma Investments, LP, an entity controlled by the Company s Chairman and Interim Chief Executive
Officer, Jane H. Hsiao ( Hsu Gamma  and together with Frost Gamma, the  Lenders ), pursuant to which the
Lenders have provided a revolving credit line (the  Credit Facility ) in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0
million, secured by all of the Company s personal property. The Company is permitted to borrow and reborrow from time to
time under the Credit Facility until July 31, 2017 (the  Credit Facility Maturity Date ). The interest rate payable
on amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility is 11% per annum, and increases to 16% per annum after the Credit Facility Maturity
Date or after an event of default. All amounts owing under the Credit Facility are required to be repaid by the Credit Facility
Maturity Date, and amounts outstanding are prepayable at any time. As of October 31, 2016, the Company had drawn an aggregate
of $1,000,000 under the Credit Facility and there is no available balance remaining.

2016
Promissory Notes.  On June 1, 2016, the Company entered into a promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000 with Frost
Gamma (the  June 2016 Frost Gamma Note ), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, which beneficially owns in excess

The June 2016 Hsu Gamma Note may be prepaid in advance of the Promissory Notes Maturity Date without premium or penalty.  

As of December 10, 2016,
the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $43,000, and did not have any further funding available under
the Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate significant revenues from sales of Exer-Rest platforms, we will have insufficient
funds to repay our existing debt and continue operations without raising additional capital. We are also examining strategic alternatives.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all or that we
will be successful in our examination of strategic alternatives. This uncertainty, along with the Company s limited remaining
cash balances, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

Not
required for smaller reporting companies as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures as of October 31, 2016 were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect, or
are reasonably likely to affect, our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended October 31, 2016. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
