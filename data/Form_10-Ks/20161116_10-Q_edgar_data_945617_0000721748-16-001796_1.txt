Note 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Accounting    

  The financial
statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S.
GAAP ). The Company has elected a fiscal year ending on December 31. Certain balance sheet reclassifications have been made
to prior period balances to reflect the current period s presentation format; such reclassifications had no impact on the
Company s consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows and had no material impact on the
Company s consolidated balance sheets.  

Reclassifications    

Prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  

Use
of Estimates in Financial Reporting    

  The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of
assets and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements during
the periods presented. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically,
and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary.
Significant estimates made in the accompanying financial statements include but are not limited to following: those related to
revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled services, lives and recoverability of equipment and other long-lived
assets, contingencies and litigation. The Company is subject to uncertainties, such as the impact of future events, economic,
environmental and political factors, and changes in the business climate; therefore, actual results may differ from those estimates.
When no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other when estimating contingent liabilities, the low end of
the range is accrued. Accordingly, the accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements will
change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company's operating
environment changes. Changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant. Such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies
are reflected in reported results of operations; if material, the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to
the financial statements.  

Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements    

  The accompanying
unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the
instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information
and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial
position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the financial statements presented
not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year.  

Table of Contents        4        

Significant
Clients and Customers    

For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, three customers individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company s revenues;
these customers accounted for approximately 41% of the Company s total revenues for the period. For the three months ended
September 30, 2015, two customers individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company s revenues; these customers accounted
for approximately 63% of the Company s total revenues for the period.  

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, three customers individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company s total revenues;
these customers accounted for approximately 53.2% of the Company s total revenues for the period. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, three customers individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company s total revenues; these customers
accounted for approximately 68% of the Company s total revenues for the period.  

Beneficial
Conversion Feature    

  If the
conversion features of conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value at issuance,
this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF ). A BCF is recorded by the Company as a debt
discount pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ACF )
Topic 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options. In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount
related to the BCF, and the Company amortizes the discount to interest expense, over the life of the debt using the effective
interest method.  

Revenue
Recognition    

  Revenue
is recognized in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, the related services are rendered or delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability
is reasonably assured.  

Net
Income (Loss) Per Common Share    

  The Company
reports net income (loss) per common share in accordance with FASB ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . This statement requires
dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings with a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the earnings per share
computations. Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and excludes the effects of any potentially dilutive
securities. Diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to any dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period.
The computation does not assume conversion, exercise or contingent exercise of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect
on earnings.  

Due to
the Company s net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, any potentially
dilutive shares outstanding for these periods, respectively, were not presented in the EPS computations, as their effect would
have been antidilutive.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

The
Company has reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and it does not believe any of
these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.  

Reclassifications    

Prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Note
8. Convertible Notes Payable   

As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company reflected convertible notes payable as follows:  

The Company
had convertible debentures which were originally issued on April 24, 2014, maturing on April 24, 2016, paid zero interest, and
were convertible until maturity at the holders  discretion into shares of the Company s common stock at $0.08 per
share. On April 11, 2016, the maturity date on this note was renegotiated to April 24th, 2018. On April 12, 2016, the Company
received notice of a partial conversion of this note in the amount of $58,000 that was converted into 725,000 shares of common
stock at a price of $0.08 per share. On May 6, 2016, the Company received notice for the conversion of the balance of the note
in the amount of $13,500 that was converted into 168,750 shares of common stock at a price of $0.08 per share. Based on this conversion,
as of September 30, 2016, the Company had remaining convertible debentures in the total amount of $0, and any unamortized debt
discount remaining on the date of conversion was amortized in full to interest expense.  

On
June 23, 2016, the Company entered into two convertible promissory notes: one for $50,000 and one for $330,000. As of the
date of this filing, the Company received $150,000 in proceeds recorded a discount of $10,935. The maturity date for each
note is February 14, 2017. Each note pays 8% fixed interest and was convertible at the holder s discretion into shares
of the Company s common stock at a conversion formula used to determine the conversion price per share. On August 4,
2016, the notes were amended and restated to change the conversion formula used to determine the conversion price per share
to a fixed price of $0.1135 per share and to delete a provision that provided for repayment of the notes through a separate
investment agreement providing for the Company to sell its registered shares to an investor.  Based on the August 4,
2016 amendment to the convertible feature of the note payable, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $59,128. In
addition, we calculated the beneficial conversion valuation before and after the amendment which yielded a change in
derivative liabilities of $64,419. 

Note
9. Accrued and Other Current Liabilities

and other current liabilities was comprised of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

warrants or new issuances of warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2016; consequently, no stock-based compensation
expense associated with warrants was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The statements
contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact, including without limitation, statements containing the words
 believes,   expects,   anticipates  and similar words, constitute forward-looking statements
that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. From time to time we may make other forward-looking statements. Investors
are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may materially differ as
a result of many factors, including the risks discussed from time to time in this report, including the risks described under
 Risk Factors  in any filings we have made with the SEC.  

Our discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On
an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to useful lives of real estate assets, cost reimbursement
income, bad debts, impairment, net lease intangibles, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There
can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.

The following
table presents our consolidated operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015:  

Revenues    

  Total revenues
were $236,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $343,129 for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
a decrease of $106,229. Although consulting service revenues remain steady for the three months ended September 2016, $143,610
or 60.6% of total revenues, versus $143,072 or 41.7% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015, we experienced
a decrease in our product and equipment revenues as amounts for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $93,290 or 39.4%
of total revenues, versus $200,057 or 58.3% of total revenues for three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was attributed
to the lifecycle of client contracts with the company experiencing spikes in product revenues during facility build-outs. The
company was not performing any facility build-outs for the three months ended September 30, 2016, while two facility build-outs
were in-progress during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Costs
of Revenues    

  Costs of
revenues primarily consist of labor, travel, and other costs directly attributable to providing services or products. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, our total costs of revenues were $104,734, or 44.2% of total revenues. This compares to
total costs of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $269,792 or 78.6% of total revenues. The decrease in
costs of revenues of $165,058 was primarily due to the change in operating activities discussed changes in our internal infrastructure.
For the three months ended September 30, 2016, consulting-related costs were $38,120, or 16.1% of total revenue, as compared to
costs of $79,245, or 23.1% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Costs associated with products and equipment
were $66,614, or 28.1% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $190,547, or 55.5% of total
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015. As a percentage of revenues the decrease was attributed to the lifecycle
of client contracts with the company experiencing spikes in product revenues during facility build-outs. The company was not performing
any facility build-outs for the three months ended September 30, 2016, while two facility build-outs were in-progress during the
three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Gross
Profit   

Total gross
profit was $132,166 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, comprised of consulting services gross profit of $105,490 and
products and equipment gross profit of $26,676. This compares to total gross profit of $73,337 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, comprised of consulting services gross profit of $63,827 and products and equipment gross profit of $9,510. These increases
of $41,663 for consulting services gross profit and $17,166 for products and equipment gross profit were primarily due to growth
in our client base and volume of operations and further establishment of our products and equipment offerings. As a percentage
of total revenues, gross profit was 55.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 21.4% for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to client state licensing approval bonuses earned by the company during
the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Operating
Expenses   

  Total operating
expenses were $387,796, or 163.7% of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $256,423, or 74.7%
of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase in general and
administrative expenses as the Company has incurred higher expenses for accounting, bad debts and legal fees all attributed to
costs of running a public company; the increase was also attributed to reduced labor allocations transferred out of general and
administrative expenses to direct project costs (cost of revenues) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
September 30, 2015. Also, the company has reduced selling and marketing efforts due to achieving stronger brand recognition in
the market place during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015,
which has resulted in less investment in trade shows and conferences expenses. As part of the efforts on strengthening current
products and services in the market in 2016, the company incurred less research and development costs for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015.

of debt of $59,128 and also an interest expense reflecting $19,605 related to convertible notes payable discount amortization
for the period, which was offset by a $64,419 gain on change in derivative liabilities for the same period. For the three months
ended September 30, 2015 the company had interest expense of $8,924.

  As a result
of the factors discussed above, net income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a net loss of $269,944
or 113.9% of total revenues for the period, as compared to a net loss of 192,010, or 56.0% of total revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2015.

equipment revenues as amounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $617,869 or 50.6% of total revenues, versus $648,411
or 51.6% of total revenues for nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was attributed to the changes in client lifecycle
activities in 2016 and increased competition from vendors as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the company incurred a non-cash interest expense
reflecting $29,935 related to convertible notes payable discount amortization for the period as compared to $26,547 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the company had income of $64,419 related to changes
in derivative liabilities, while recognizing a loss on extinguishment of debt of $59,128 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 as compared to a gain on extinguishment of debt of $72,771 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As of September
30, 2016, our primary internal sources of liquidity were our working capital, which included cash and cash equivalents of $71,572
and accounts receivable of $185,754. We also have the ability to raise additional capital as needed through external equity financing
transactions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of non-cash expenses, the Company s operating
cash flows were a use of $619,983 due to an increase in accounts receivable of $203,900, an increase in prepaid expenses and other
current assets of $16,150 and a decrease in accrued and other current liabilities of $91,484 and a decrease in accounts payable
of $117,206. These amounts were offset by decreases in Deposits of $2,845 and an increase in advances from clients of $57,326.
Additionally, considering that our fixed overhead costs are low, and we have the ability to issue stock to compensate employees
and management, we believe our liquidity and capital resources to be adequate to fund our general and administrative expenses.
The Company will continue to explore capital raising opportunities in the future.  

Operating
Activities   

Net cash
used in operating activities for the nine months September 30, 2016 was $619,983 and cash provided was $98,192 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The $619,983 use of cash was due to loss of $368,276 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 along with an increase in accounts receivable of $203,900 and a $117,206 decrease in accounts payable, offset by an increase
in advances from clients of $57,326 and an increase in deposits of $2,845. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 was $98,192, consisting of net loss of $462,462, noncash adjustments reconciling net income to
net cash provided by operating activities of $211,894 and a net source of cash of $348,760 from changes in operating assets and
liabilities. The net noncash adjustments of $211,894 were due to stock-based compensation granted to service providers of $146,655,
employee stock-based compensation of $102,857, amortization of the discount on convertible notes payable of $26,703, bad debt
expense of $6,015, and depreciation expense of $2,435, partially offset by a gain on debt extinguishment of $72,771 related to
a negotiated settlement of accumulated legal fees. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, a net source of cash of $348,760,
were the result of an increase in deferred revenue of $676,144 primarily related to customer prepayments on large product and
equipment orders and an increase in accounts payable of $89,472, partially offset by an increase in deposits of $193,794, an increase
in accounts receivable of $138,156, an increase inventory $67,847 that primarily reflects the receipt of Satchel inventory during
the period, and a decrease in accrued and other current liabilities of $1,993.   

Investing
Activities   

  For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, investing activities were a use of cash of $3,290 and $24,583, respectively. This
was due to purchases of office furniture and computer equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

issuance of a convertible promissory note. Net cash provided by financing activities of $250,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 reflected the sale of 833,333 shares of common stock to an investor during the period.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements    

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures    

We use
Adjusted EBITA, a non-GAAP metric, to monitor our overall business performance. We define Adjusted EBITA as net income (loss)
before interest expense, net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, stock-based compensation and certain non-recurring expenses,
which to date have been limited to costs associated with the Reverse Merger. We believe that such adjustments to arrive at Adjusted
EBITA provides us with a more comparable measure for managing our business. We also believe that it is a useful measure for securities
analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our Company.  

A reconciliation
of net loss to Adjusted EBITA is provided below:  

ITEM
3.  QUANTITATIVE   QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

We
are a smaller reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item.  

ITEM
4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Management
of the Company is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that financial information
required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeframes specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms, consistent with Items 307 and 308 of Regulation S-K.  

In
addition, the disclosure controls and procedures must ensure that such financial information is accumulated and communicated to
the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required financial and other required disclosures.  

As
of September 30, 2016, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) was carried out under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other persons carrying
out similar functions for the Company. Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the
Company concluded that during the period covered by this report, such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  

The
Company continues to employ and refine a structure in which critical accounting policies, issues and estimates are identified,
and together with other complex areas, are subject to multiple reviews by accounting personnel. In addition, the Company evaluates
and assesses its internal controls and procedures regarding its financial reporting, utilizing standards incorporating applicable
portions of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board s 2009 Guidance for Smaller Public Companies in Auditing Internal
Controls Over Financial Reporting as necessary and on an on-going basis.  

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of the prevention or
detection of misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.  

Changes
in Internal Controls   

The
Company had no reportable changes to its internal controls over financial reporting for the period covered by this report.     

The
Company will continually enhance and test its internal controls over financial reporting on a continuing basis. Additionally,
the Company s management, under the control of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will increase its
review of its disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. Finally, the Company plans to designate, in conjunction
with its Chief Financial Officer, individuals responsible for identifying reportable developments and the process for resolving
compliance issues related to them. The Company believes these actions will focus necessary attention and resources in its internal
accounting functions.
