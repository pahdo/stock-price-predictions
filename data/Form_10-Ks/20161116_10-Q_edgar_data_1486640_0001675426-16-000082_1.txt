NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

  (UNAUDITED)    

  NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
AND   BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

  Formerly
known as Nevada Legacy Enterprises Corporation   and NL One Corporation,  Flagship Global Corporation (the
 Company ) was incorporated on October 17, 2007 in the State of Nevada.   

Our
focus is to develop and market new and innovative electronic, fiber optic, and information technologies. We currently own
the rights to two patent pending technologies for health care monitoring devices. However, while our current technologies
focus on health care, we plan to expand these technologies into applications for other market segments, and we may also pursue
new technologies in areas not related to the health care industry.   

On May 11, 2016, Thomas DeNunzio, the
largest control shareholder at the time of NL One Corporation (the  Company ), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement
(the  Agreement ) with Stansbridge Limited, ( Stansbridge ), a United Kingdom company. Pursuant to the
Agreement, Mr. DeNunzio transferred to Stansbridge 40,501,000 post-split (324,008,000 (presplit)) shares of our common stock,
which represents approximately 92.87% of our issued and outstanding shares. 

On May 31, 2016, the Company s Board
of Directors and majority vote of shareholders approved a one-for-eight stock split of the Company s issued and outstanding
common stock, par value $.0001 per share and to change the name of the Company from  NL One Corporation  to  Flagship
Global Corporation.  In addition, the board of directors and shareholders approved and voted to change our ticker symbol
from NLLN to FGCN. 

Effective as of June 17, 2016, the total outstanding
shares of the Company following the reverse stock split is now 43,611,250 shares of common stock. Our controlling shareholder,
Stansbridge Limited now owns approximately 40,501,000 shares of our common stock. Stansbridge Limited is owned and controlled by
our sole officer and director, Gary Richard Brown. All references to common stock shares amounts have been retroactively adjusted.
The total number of the authorized shares of common stock after the effective date of the reverse split is 500,000,000 common shares
with a par value of $0.0001 per share. 

The Company s accounting and reporting
policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company s fiscal year end
is December 31.  

The accompanying unaudited interim financial
statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
or the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation SX. In the opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments,
which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position as of September 30, 2016, and the results
of operations and cash flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Results for the interim periods presented
are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. When
used in these notes, the terms  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our  mean the Company. Certain
information and note disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America has been omitted from these interim financial statements pursuant to such accounting
principles and, accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive interim financial statements
and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN  

The Company s interim unaudited
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to
a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The
Company has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Company will engage in very limited activities without incurring any
liabilities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured. The Company will offer noncash consideration and
seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue producing contracts or financing
or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur, it may substantially
curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions or other arrangements
that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to
continue as a going concern. 

  NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

  Contributed Capital  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
there were capital contributions of $5,863 from Frontier Limited LLC, a Company owned by our former majority shareholder, Thomas
DeNunzio. These contributions were for expenses and professional fees.

ITEM 2   
     
            MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
        FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    
 
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we had a net
loss of $11,646 which is $3,434 less when compared to our net loss of $15,080 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We attribute
this decrease to a decrease in operating expenses of which are comprised mostly of professional fees. 

PLAN OF OPERATION   

 Our cash balance is $0 as of September 30,
2016.  We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We
may utilize funds from our President and CEO as well as our majority shareholder, who has informally agreed to contribute funds
to allow us to pay for filing fees, and professional fees for no further consideration. The President, CEO and sole Director,
however, have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company. The Company has no
debt payable to the CEO, President or sole Director as of September 30, 2016. 

In order to achieve our business plan
goals, we will need to obtain additional funding. We are a growth stage company and have generated no revenue to date. At the present
time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional funds. 

If we need additional cash and cannot
raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. 

  LIQUIDITY  

We have no known demands or commitments
and are not aware of any events or uncertainties as of September 30, 2016 that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially
increase or decrease our current liquidity. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES  

We had no material commitments for capital
expenditures as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Table of Contents  

  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

 The Company does not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

We prepare our unaudited interim financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates
and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the
interim financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain,
materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we
review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our interim financial statements. 

While we believe that the historical
experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.  

ITEM 3   
     
            QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK     
 
 As a  smaller reporting
company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this
Item. 

ITEM 4   
         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

 Our Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on
that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report were ineffective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in
reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 

Material weaknesses noted were: lack
of a functioning audit committee; lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight
in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with
control objectives affecting authorization, recordkeeping, custody of assets, and reconciliations; and, management is dominated
by a single individual/small group without adequate compensating controls. 

Management believes that the material
weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning
audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the
establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our
financial statements in future periods.  

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  

 There have been no significant
changes to the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.  

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    
 
 There are no legal proceedings
against the Company and the Company is unaware of such proceedings contemplated against it. 

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS    
 
 As a  smaller reporting
company  defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM 2 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS    
 
 During the period between our previous fiscal year-end
of December 31, 2015 through the date of this filing there have been no unregistered sales of securities.

RELEASE 34-46427  

 I, Gary Richard Brown, certify that: 

1.  
      I have reviewed this report on Form 10-Q of Flagship Global Corporation.    

2.  
      Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;   

3.  
      Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;   

4.  
      As the registrant s Principal Executive officer and Principal Financial Officer, I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and I have:   

a) designed such disclosure
controls and procedures or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material
information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities,
particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b) designed such internal

to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 

c) evaluated the effectiveness
of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness

report any change in registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most
recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of the annual report) that has materially affected,

5.  
      I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
