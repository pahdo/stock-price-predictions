      Note 1   Interim Financial Data  
 Basis of Presentation 
 The information furnished in these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ).  In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.  The results of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 do not necessarily indicate the results which may be expected for the full fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 ( fiscal 2017 ). 
 These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, significant accounting policies, and other Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Toyota Motor Credit Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Form 10-K ) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 ( fiscal 2016 ), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 2, 2016.

    Note 1   Interim Financial Data (Continued)  
 New Accounting Guidance 
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.  This comprehensive standard will supersede virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance.  This standard applies to all contracts with customers except leases, insurance contracts, financial instruments, guarantees, and certain nonmonetary exchanges.  In August 2015, the FASB issued a one-year deferral of the effective date, with early adoption as of the original effective date permitted.  In March 2016, the FASB clarified the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB amended the guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses. In May 2016, the FASB amended the guidance on certain implementation and transition issues. The revenue guidance will be effective for us on April 1, 2018.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In May 2015, the FASB issued new guidance that requires additional disclosures related to short-duration insurance contracts.  This accounting guidance is effective for us for the annual period beginning April 1, 2016 and for interim periods within annual periods beginning April 1, 2017.  The adoption of this guidance is limited to disclosure and will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.   
 In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments and will require entities to measure equity investments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in earnings.  This accounting guidance will be effective for us on April 1, 2018.   We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet and aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in the new revenue recognition standard. The new leasing standard represents a wholesale change to lease accounting.  This accounting guidance will be effective for us on April 1, 2019.   We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a designated derivative hedging instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.  This accounting guidance will be effective for us on April 1, 2017.   The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which clarifies whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to the debt host when bifurcating an embedded derivative. This accounting guidance will be effective for us on April 1, 2017.   The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that introduces a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses for certain types of financial instruments. It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. This accounting guidance will be effective for us on April 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that is intended to reduce diversity in practice in the classification of certain items in the statement of cash flows. This accounting guidance will be effective for us on April 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance that further amends the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain legal entities.  The guidance specifically addresses interests held through related parties that are under common control.  This accounting guidance will be effective for us on April 1, 2017.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

    Note 1   Interim Financial Data (Con  tinued)  
 Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance 
 In April 2016, we adopted new FASB accounting guidance that amends the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain legal entities.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In April 2016, we adopted new FASB accounting guidance that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset.  As a result of adopting this guidance, we have reclassified our debt issuance costs from Other assets to Debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and conformed applicable footnote disclosures for all periods presented. These amounts are not material to our consolidated financial statements. 
 In April 2016, we adopted new FASB accounting guidance to help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement.  While similar guidance existed previously under US GAAP for cloud service providers, this update provides explicit guidance for a customer's accounting.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In April 2016, we adopted new FASB accounting guidance that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Note 2   Fair Value Measurements has been updated, for all periods presented, to reflect the adoption of this guidance which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The following tables summarize our financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy except for certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and are excluded from the leveling information provided in the table below.  Fair value amounts presented below are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

    Note 2   Fair Value Measurements   (Continued)  
 Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of their respective reporting periods.  Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 resulted from changes in the transparency of inputs and were not significant. 
 The following tables summarize the rollforward of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs:

 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
 Nonrecurring fair value measurements include Level 3 net finance receivables that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments utilizing the fair value of the underlying collateral when there is evidence of impairment. We did not have any significant nonrecurring fair value items as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016. 
 Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value which are subject to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurement, and the corresponding change in the fair value measurements of these assets and liabilities, were not significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Income as of and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and as of and for the year ended March 31, 2016.

The carrying value of each class of finance receivables includes accrued interest and deferred fees and costs, net of deferred income and the allowance for credit losses.  Finance receivables, net, excludes related party transactions, for which the fair value approximates the carrying value, of $123 million and $128 million at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. 
 The carrying value of unsecured notes and loans payable represents the sum of unsecured notes and loans payable and carrying value adjustment as described in Note 9   Debt.

    Note 3   Investments in Marketable Securities   (Continued)  

The Fixed income mutual funds, exclusive of the Total return bond funds, are investments in funds that are privately placed and managed by an open-end investment management company (the  Trust ).  If we elect to redeem shares, the Trust will normally redeem all shares for cash, but may, in unusual circumstances, redeem amounts exceeding the lesser of $250 thousand or 1 percent of the Trust s asset value by payment in kind of securities held by the respective fund during any 90-day period. 
 The Total return bond funds are investments in actively traded open-end mutual funds.  Redemptions are subject to normal terms and conditions as described in each fund s prospectus.

 Unrealized Losses on Securities 
 Investments in marketable securities in a continuous loss position for less than twelve months and for greater than twelve months were not significant as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016. 
 Realized Gains and Losses on Securities 
 The following table represents realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment on our available-for-sale securities: 

In October 2016, we sold our remaining Equity mutual fund portfolio to take advantage of favorable market conditions.  The sale resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $262 million and realized gains of approximately $154 million, which will be reflected in our results of operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  The proceeds are expected to be utilized for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of retail and lease contracts and the payment of debt.  
 Contractual Maturities 
 The amortized cost, fair value, and contractual maturities of available-for-sale debt instruments are summarized in the following table.  Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.

 Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are shown separately from other maturity groupings as these securities do not have a single maturity date.

    Note 4   Finance Receivables, Net  
 Finance receivables, net consist of retail receivables and dealer financing, which includes accrued interest and deferred fees and costs, net of the allowance for credit losses and deferred income.  Finance receivables, net include securitized retail receivables, which represent retail receivables that have been sold for legal purposes to securitization trusts but continue to be included in our consolidated financial statements, as discussed further in Note 10   Variable Interest Entities.  Cash flows from these securitized retail receivables are available only for the repayment of debt issued by these trusts and other obligations arising from the securitization transactions.  They are not available for payment of our other obligations or to satisfy claims of our other creditors. 
 Finance receivables, net consisted of the following: 

Credit Quality Indicators 
 We are exposed to credit risk on our finance receivables.  Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the failure of customers or dealers to meet the terms of their contracts with us or otherwise fail to perform as agreed. 
 Retail Loan Portfolio Segment 
 The retail loan portfolio segment consists of one class of finance receivables. While we use various credit quality metrics to develop our allowance for credit losses on the retail loan portfolio segment, we primarily utilize the aging of the individual accounts to monitor the credit quality of these finance receivables.  Based on our experience, the payment status of borrowers is the strongest indicator of the credit quality of the underlying receivables.  Payment status also impacts charge-offs. 
 Individual borrower accounts within the retail loan segment are segregated into aging categories based on the number of days outstanding.  The aging for each class of finance receivables is updated monthly.

    Note 4   Finance Receivables, Net   (Continued)  
 Dealer Products Portfolio Segment 
 For the three classes of finance receivables within the dealer products portfolio segment (wholesale, real estate and working capital), all loans outstanding for an individual dealer or dealer group, which includes affiliated entities, are aggregated and evaluated collectively by dealer or dealer group.  This reflects the interconnected nature of financing provided to our individual dealer and dealer group customers, and their affiliated entities. 
 When assessing the credit quality of the finance receivables within the dealer products portfolio segment, we segregate the finance receivables account balances into four categories representing distinct credit quality indicators based on internal risk assessments.  The internal risk assessments for all finance receivables within the dealer products portfolio segment are updated on a monthly basis. 
 The four credit quality indicators are: 

Performing   Account not classified as either Credit Watch, At Risk or Default     

Credit Watch   Account designated for elevated attention     

At Risk   Account where there is an increased likelihood that default may exist based on qualitative and quantitative factors     

Default   Account is not currently meeting contractual obligations or we have temporarily waived certain contractual requirements     

 The tables below present each credit quality indicator by class of finance receivables:

 Impaired Finance Receivables 
 The following table summarizes the information related to our impaired loans by class of finance receivables:  

As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the impaired finance receivables balance for accounts in the dealer products portfolio segment that were on nonaccrual status was $221 million and $299 million, respectively, and there were no charge-offs against the allowance for credit losses for these finance receivables.  Therefore, the impaired finance receivables balance is equal to the unpaid principal balance.  As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, impaired finance receivables in the retail portfolio segment recorded at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs were not significant and therefore excluded from the table above.  Refer to Note 6   Allowance for Credit Losses for detail about the impaired account balances which are aggregated and evaluated for impairment when determining the allowance for credit losses.

    Note 4   Finance Receivables, Net   (Continued)  
 The following table summarizes the average impaired loans by class of finance receivables as of the balance sheet date and the interest income recognized on these loans: 

The primary source of interest income recognized on the loans in the table above is from performing troubled debt restructurings.  In addition, interest income recognized using a cash-basis method of accounting during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was not significant. Average Impaired Finance Receivables and Interest Income Recognized during the three and six months ended September 30, 2015 related to our commercial finance business were not significant.  As discussed in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2016, we sold our commercial finance business on October 1, 2015.

 Troubled Debt Restructuring 
 For accounts not under bankruptcy protection, the amount of finance receivables modified as a troubled debt restructuring during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was not significant for each class of finance receivables.  Troubled debt restructurings for non-bankrupt accounts within the retail loan class of finance receivables are comprised exclusively of contract term extensions that reduce the monthly payment due from the customer.  For the three classes of finance receivables within the dealer products portfolio segment, troubled debt restructurings include contract term extensions, interest rate adjustments, waivers of loan covenants, or any combination of the three.  Troubled debt restructurings of accounts not under bankruptcy protection did not include forgiveness of principal or interest rate adjustments during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
 We consider finance receivables under bankruptcy protection within the retail loan class to be troubled debt restructurings as of the date we receive notice of a customer filing for bankruptcy protection, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings.  The bankruptcy court may impose modifications as part of the proceedings, including interest rate adjustments and forgiveness of principal.  For the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the financial impact of troubled debt restructurings related to finance receivables under bankruptcy protection was not significant to our Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
 Payment Defaults 
 Finance receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings for which there was a subsequent payment default during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for which the modification occurred within twelve months of the payment default, were not significant for all classes of such receivables.

 Investments in operating leases, net consist of leases, net of deferred fees and costs, deferred income, accumulated depreciation and the allowance for credit losses.  Securitized investments in operating leases represent beneficial interests in a pool of certain vehicle leases that have been sold for legal purposes to securitization trusts but continue to be included in our consolidated financial statements as discussed further in Note 10 - Variable Interest Entities.  Cash flows from these securitized investments in operating leases are available only for the repayment of debt issued by these trusts and other obligations arising from the securitization transactions.  They are not available for payment of our other obligations or to satisfy claims of our other creditors.

 The ending balance of finance receivables collectively evaluated for impairment in the preceding table includes approximately $224 million of finance receivables within the retail loan portfolio segment that are specifically identified as impaired.  These amounts are aggregated within their respective portfolio segment when determining the allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2016, as they are deemed to be insignificant for individual evaluation, and we have determined that the allowance for credit losses is not significant and would not be materially different if the amounts had been individually evaluated for impairment.  The ending balance of finance receivables for the dealer products portfolio segment collectively evaluated for impairment as of September 30, 2016 includes $1,054 million in finance receivables that are guaranteed by Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. ( TMS ), and $158 million in finance receivables that are guaranteed by third party private Toyota distributors.  These finance receivables are related to certain Toyota and Lexus dealers and other third parties to whom we provided financing at the request of TMS and third party private Toyota distributors. 

Included in the tables above are the allowance for credit losses and finance receivables from our commercial portfolio segment related to the commercial finance business that was sold on October 1, 2015.

    Note 7   Derivatives, Hedging Activities and Interest Expense  
 Derivative Instruments 
 Our liabilities consist mainly of fixed and floating rate debt, denominated in various currencies, which we issue in the global capital markets, while our assets consist primarily of U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate receivables.  We enter into interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps and foreign currency swaps to hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks that result from the different characteristics of our assets and liabilities.  Our use of derivative transactions is intended to reduce long-term fluctuations in the fair value of assets and liabilities caused by market movements.  All of our derivative activities are authorized and monitored by our management and our Asset Liability Committee which provides a framework for financial controls and governance to manage market risk. 
 Credit Risk Related Contingent Features 
 Our derivative contracts are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) Master Agreements.  Substantially all of these ISDA Master Agreements contain reciprocal ratings triggers providing either party with an option to terminate the agreement at market value in the event of a ratings downgrade of the other party below a specified threshold.  As of September 30, 2016, we have daily valuation and collateral exchange arrangements with all of our counterparties.  Our collateral agreements with substantially all of our counterparties include a zero threshold, full collateralization arrangement.  However, due to the time required to move collateral, there may be a delay of up to one day between the exchange of collateral and the valuation of our derivatives.  We would not be required to post additional collateral to the counterparties with whom we were in a net liability position at September 30, 2016 if our credit ratings were to decline, since we fully collateralize without regard to credit ratings with these counterparties.

 The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, including the location and amount of gains and losses on derivative instruments and related hedged items, as reported in our Consolidated Statement of Income: 

Interest expense on debt and derivatives represents net interest settlements and changes in accruals.  Gains and losses on hedge accounting derivatives and debt dominated in foreign currencies exclude net interest settlements and changes in accruals.  Cash flows associated with hedge accounting, non-hedge accounting, and de-designated derivatives are reported in Net cash provided by operating activities in our Statement of Cash Flows. 
 The relative fair value allocation of derivative credit value adjustments for counterparty and non-performance credit risk within interest expense was not significant for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as we are fully collateralized on substantially all of our derivatives without regard to credit ratings.

    Note 9   Debt  
 Debt and the related weighted average contractual interest rates are summarized as follows: 

Included in the carrying value of our debt are unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs of $297 million and $280 million as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.  The face value of commercial paper, unsecured notes and loans payable and secured notes and loans payable was $27.8 billion, $52.3 billion, and $14.2 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2016, and $26.6 billion, $53.0 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2016. 
 As of September 30, 2016, our commercial paper had a weighted average remaining maturity of 95 days, while our unsecured and secured notes and loans payable mature on various dates through fiscal 2047.  Weighted average contractual interest rates are calculated based on original notional or par value before consideration of premium or discount. 
 Our unsecured notes and loans payable consist of both fixed and variable rate debt with contractual interest rates ranging from 0 percent to 9.4 percent at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.  Upon issuance of fixed rate notes, we generally elect to enter into interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate payments on notes to floating rate payments. 
 Our unsecured notes and loans payable contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  We are currently in compliance with these covenants and conditions. 
 Certain unsecured notes and loans payable are denominated in various foreign currencies, and include the impact of translation adjustments.  At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the carrying values of these foreign currency denominated notes and loans payable were $13.5 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively.  Concurrent with the issuance of these foreign currency unsecured notes and loans payable, we entered into foreign currency swaps in the same notional amount to convert non-U.S. currency payments to U.S. dollar denominated payments. 
 Our secured notes and loans payable are denominated in U.S. dollars and consist of both fixed and variable rate debt with contractual interest rates ranging from 0.7 percent to 1.7 percent at September 30, 2016 and 0.5 percent to 1.7 percent at March 31, 2016.  Secured notes and loans payable are issued using on-balance sheet securitization trusts, as further discussed in Note 10   Variable Interest Entities.  These notes are repayable only from collections on the underlying securitized retail finance receivables and the beneficial interests in investments in operating leases and from related credit enhancements. 
 The carrying value adjustment on debt represents the effects of fair value adjustments to debt in hedging relationships, accrued redemption premiums, and the unamortized fair value adjustments on the hedged item for terminated fair value hedge accounting relationships.  The carrying value adjustment on debt increased by $26 million at September 30, 2016 compared to March 31, 2016 primarily as a result of changes in U.S. dollar rates relative to certain other currencies in which our hedged debt is denominated.

    Note 10   Variable Interest Entities  
 Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 We use one or more special purpose entities that are considered Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs ) to issue asset-backed securities to third party bank-sponsored asset-backed securitization vehicles and to investors in securitization transactions.  The securities issued by these VIEs are backed by the cash flows related to retail finance receivables and beneficial interests in investments in operating leases ( Securitized Assets ).  We hold variable interests in the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs.  We determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the securitization trusts because (i) our servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs, and (ii) our variable interests in the VIEs give us the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. 
 The following tables show the assets and liabilities related to our VIE securitization transactions that were included in our financial statements: 

Restricted Cash shown in the table above represents collections from the underlying Gross Securitized Assets and certain reserve deposits held by TMCC for the VIEs and is included as part of the Restricted cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Gross Securitized Assets represent finance receivables and beneficial interests in investments in operating leases securitized for the asset-backed securities issued.  Net Securitized Assets are presented net of deferred fees and costs, deferred income, accumulated depreciation and the allowance for credit losses.  Other Assets represent used vehicles held-for-sale that were repossessed by or returned to TMCC for the benefit of the VIEs.  The related debt of these consolidated VIEs is presented net of $1,469 million and $1,264 million of securities retained by TMCC at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.  Other Liabilities represents accrued interest on the debt of the consolidated VIEs. 
 The assets of the VIEs and the restricted cash held by TMCC serve as the sole source of repayment for the asset-backed securities issued by these entities.  Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do not have recourse to us or our other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase provisions and indemnities. 
 As the primary beneficiary of these entities, we are exposed to credit, residual value, interest rate, and prepayment risk from the Securitized Assets in the VIEs.  However, our exposure to these risks did not change as a result of the transfer of the assets to the VIEs.  We may also be exposed to interest rate risk arising from the secured notes issued by the VIEs. 
 In addition, we entered into interest rate swaps with certain special purpose entities that issue variable rate debt.  Under the terms of these swaps, the special purpose entities are obligated to pay TMCC a fixed rate of interest on certain payment dates in exchange for receiving a floating rate of interest on notional amounts equal to the outstanding balance of the secured debt.

    Note 10   Variable Interest Entities (Continued)  
 This arrangement enables the special purpose entities to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in issuing variable rate debt that is secured by fixed rate Securitized Assets. 
 The transfers of the Securitized Assets to the special purpose entities in our securitizations are considered to be sales for legal purposes.  However, the Securitized Assets and the related secured debt remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We recognize financing revenue on the Securitized Assets and interest expense on the secured debt issued by the special purpose entities.  We also maintain an allowance for credit losses on the Securitized Assets to cover estimated probable credit losses using a methodology consistent with that used for our non-securitized asset portfolio.  The interest rate swaps between TMCC and the special purpose entities are considered intercompany transactions and therefore are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. 
 Non-consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 We provide lending to Toyota and Lexus dealers through the Toyota Dealer Investment Group s Dealer Capital Program ( TDIG Program ) operated by our affiliate TMS, which has an equity interest in these dealerships.  Dealers participating in this program have been determined to be VIEs.  We do not consolidate the dealerships in this program as we are not the primary beneficiary and any exposure to loss is limited to the amount of the credit facility.  Amounts due from these dealers under the TDIG Program that are classified as Finance receivables, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 and revenues received from these dealers during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.  
 We also have other lending relationships, which have been determined to be VIEs, but these relationships are not consolidated as we are not the primary beneficiary.  Amounts due under these relationships as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 were not significant.

 The ability to make draws is subject to covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  These agreements may be used for general corporate purposes and none were drawn upon as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.  We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above. 
 Other Unsecured Credit Agreements 
 TMCC has entered into additional unsecured credit facilities with various banks.  As of September 30, 2016, TMCC had committed bank credit facilities totaling $5.4 billion of which $1.9 billion, $775 million, $1.7 billion, and $1.0 billion mature in fiscal 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. 
 These credit agreements contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  These credit facilities were not drawn upon as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016. We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above.

    Note 12     Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)  
 Commitments 
 We provide fixed and variable rate working capital loans, revolving lines of credit, and real estate financing to dealers and various multi-franchise organizations referred to as dealer groups for facilities construction and refurbishment, working capital requirements, real estate purchases, business acquisitions and other general business purposes.  These loans are typically secured with liens on real estate, vehicle inventory, and/or other dealership assets, as appropriate, and may be guaranteed by individual or corporate guarantees of affiliated dealers, dealer groups, or dealer principals.  Although the loans are typically collateralized or guaranteed, the value of the underlying collateral or guarantees may not be sufficient to cover our exposure under such agreements.  Our pricing reflects market conditions, the competitive environment, the level of support dealers provide our retail, lease and insurance business and the credit worthiness of each dealer.  Amounts drawn under these facilities are reviewed for collectability on a quarterly basis, in conjunction with our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses.  
 On April 28, 2014, the Company announced that our corporate headquarters will move from Torrance, California to Plano, Texas as part of TMC s planned consolidation of its three North American headquarters for manufacturing, sales and marketing to a single new headquarters facility.  To date, the Company has not incurred significant costs related to employee relocation, lease termination or other related relocation expenses as a result of this planned headquarters move.  These moving costs are currently estimated to be approximately $118 million and will be expensed as incurred over the next several years.  The moving costs incurred during the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 were not significant. 
 Guarantees and Other Contingencies 
 TMCC has guaranteed bond obligations totaling $100 million in principal that were issued by Putnam County, West Virginia and Gibson County, Indiana to finance the construction of pollution control facilities at manufacturing plants of certain TMCC affiliates.  The bonds mature in the following fiscal years ending March 31: 2028 - $20 million; 2029 - $50 million; 2030 - $10 million; 2031 - $10 million; and 2032 - $10 million.  TMCC would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event of non-payment on the bonds and other related obligations.  TMCC is entitled to reimbursement by the affiliates for any amounts paid.  TMCC receives an annual fee of $78 thousand for guaranteeing such payments.  TMCC has not been required to perform under any of these affiliate bond guarantees as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016. 
 Indemnification 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements containing indemnification provisions standard in the industry related to several types of transactions, including, but not limited to, debt funding, derivatives, securitization transactions, and our vendor and supplier agreements.  Performance under these indemnities would occur upon a breach of the representations, warranties or covenants made or given, or a third party claim. In addition, we have agreed in certain debt and derivative issuances, and subject to certain exceptions, to gross-up payments due to third parties in the event that withholding tax is imposed on such payments.  In addition, certain of our funding arrangements may require us to pay lenders for increased costs due to certain changes in laws or regulations.  Due to the difficulty in predicting events which could cause a breach of the indemnification provisions or trigger a gross-up or other payment obligation, we are not able to estimate our maximum exposure to future payments that could result from claims made under such provisions.  We have not made any material payments in the past as a result of these provisions, and as of September 30, 2016, we determined that it is not probable that we will be required to make any material payments in the future.  As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, no amounts have been recorded under these indemnification provisions.

 Litigation and Governmental Proceedings 
 Various legal actions, governmental proceedings and other claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  Certain of these actions are or purport to be class action suits, seeking sizeable damages and/or changes in our business operations, policies and practices.  Certain of these actions are similar to suits that have been filed against other financial institutions and captive finance companies.  We perform periodic reviews of pending claims and actions to determine the probability of adverse verdicts and resulting amounts of liability.  We establish accruals for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  When we are able, we also determine estimates of reasonably possible loss or range of loss, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability.  Given the inherent uncertainty associated with legal matters, the actual costs of resolving legal claims and associated costs of defense may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts for which accruals have been established.  Based on available information and established accruals, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the results of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 
 We have received a request for documents and information from the New York State Department of Financial Services relating to our lending practices (including fair lending), and a request for documents and information pursuant to a civil investigative demand from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General relating to our financing of guaranteed auto protection insurance products on retail contracts.  We are cooperating with these requests, but are unable to predict their outcome given their preliminary status.

    Note 13     Income Taxes     
 Our effective tax rate was 37 percent for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 38 percent and 37 percent for the same periods in fiscal 2016, respectively.  Our provision for income taxes was $95 million and $241 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $161 million and $231 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The change in the provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 is consistent with the change in our income before tax compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016.   
 Tax-related Contingencies 
 As of September 30, 2016, we remain under IRS examination for fiscal 2016 and 2017.  The IRS examination for fiscal 2015 was concluded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. 
 We periodically review our uncertain tax positions.  Our assessment is based on many factors including any ongoing IRS audits.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, our assessment did not result in a material change in unrecognized tax benefits. 
 Our deferred tax assets were $1.3 billion and $1.9 billion at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, and were primarily due to the deferred deduction of allowance for credit and residual value losses and federal tax loss carryforwards that expire in fiscal 2035.  The total deferred tax liability at September 30, 2016, net of these deferred tax assets, was $8.2 billion compared to $8.0 billion at March 31, 2016.  Realization with respect to the federal tax loss carryforwards is dependent on sufficient income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards.  Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.  The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced if management s estimates change.

OVERVIEW  
 Key Performance Indicators and Factors Affecting Our Business 
 In our finance operations, we generate revenue, income, and cash flows by providing retail, lease, and dealer financing to dealers and their customers.  We measure the performance of our financing operations using the following metrics: financing volume, market share, financial leverage, financing margins, operating expense, residual value and credit loss metrics. 
 In our insurance operations, we generate revenue through marketing, underwriting, and providing claims administration for products that cover certain risks of vehicle dealers and their customers.  We measure the performance of our insurance operations using the following metrics: issued agreement volume, average number of agreements in force, loss metrics, and investment income. 
 Our financial results are affected by a variety of economic and industry factors including, but not limited to, new and used vehicle markets, Toyota and Lexus sales volume, new vehicle incentives, consumer behavior, employment levels, our ability to respond to changes in interest rates with respect to both contract pricing and funding, the actual or perceived quality, safety or reliability of Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles, the financial health of the dealers we finance, and competitive pressure. All of these factors can influence consumer contract and dealer financing volume, the number of consumer contracts and dealers that default and the loss per occurrence, our inability to realize originally estimated contractual residual values on leased vehicles, the volume and performance of our insurance operations, and our gross margins on consumer contract and dealer financing volume.  Changes in the volume of vehicle sales, utilization of our insurance programs, or the level of coverage purchased by affiliates could materially and adversely impact our insurance operations.  Additionally, our funding programs and related costs are influenced by changes in the global capital markets, prevailing interest rates, and our credit ratings and those of our parent companies, which may affect our ability to obtain cost effective funding to support earning asset growth.  
 Our financial results may also be affected by the regulatory environment in which we operate, including compliance costs and changes to our business practices required by the consent orders we entered into in February 2016 with the CFPB and the Department of Justice with respect to our discretionary dealer compensation practices.  The compliance costs and the changes to our business practices required by the consent orders, including our implementation of the reduced dealer participation caps, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition, including our financing volume, market share, financing margins, and net earning assets.

Fiscal 2017 First Six Months Operating Environment  
 During the first half of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 ( fiscal 2017 ), the United States ( U.S. ) economy experienced stability as the housing market remained strong and unemployment rates were relatively consistent.  However, consumer debt levels remained elevated as a result of increased consumer spending.  As consumers assume higher debt levels, we could experience an increase in our delinquencies and credit losses.   
 Used vehicle values for Toyota and Lexus vehicles decreased during the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.  In addition, the supply of used vehicles has increased which has also contributed to the decline in used vehicle values.  Further declines in used vehicle values, an increase in the supply of used vehicles and a larger lease portfolio resulting in higher future maturities could continue to unfavorably impact return rates, depreciation expense and credit losses in the future. 
 Conditions in the global capital markets were generally stable during the first half of fiscal 2017.  However, concerns regarding global economic growth and changing expectations of the future path of U.S. monetary policy led to intermittent periods of volatility.  We continue to maintain broad global access to both domestic and international markets.  Future changes in interest rates in the U.S. and foreign markets could result in volatility in our interest expense, which could affect our results of operations. 
 Industry-wide vehicle sales in the U.S. have declined slightly despite elevated sales incentives during the first half of fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.  Vehicle sales by TMS decreased 3 percent in the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 due to lower consumer demand for new vehicles.  Financing volume decreased 7 percent for the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 due to increased competition from financial institutions and a decline in demand for new vehicles.  Overall market share decreased 4 percentage points for the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased competition from financial institutions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
 The following table summarizes total net income by our reportable operating segments: 

1       
 
 Refer to Note 15 - Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the total asset balances of our finance and insurance operations.    

 Our consolidated net income was $404 million and $163 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to $400 million and $265 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The increase in net income for the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a $331 million increase in operating lease revenues, a $112 million increase in investment and other income, net and a $107 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a $466 million increase in depreciation on operating leases and a $63 million increase in provision for credit losses.  The decrease in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a $237 million increase in depreciation on operating leases, a $94 million increase in interest expense and a $56 million increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $136 million increase in operating lease revenues, a $98 million increase in investment and other income, net and a $66 million decrease in provision for income taxes. 
 Our overall capital position increased $0.4 billion, bringing total shareholder s equity to $9.8 billion at September 30, 2016 as compared to $9.4 billion at March 31, 2016.  Our debt increased to $94.1 billion at September 30, 2016 from $93.6 billion at March 31, 2016.  Our debt-to-equity ratio decreased to 9.6 at September 30, 2016 from 10.0 at March 31, 2016.

Finance Operations  
   
 The following table summarizes key results of our Finance Operations: 

Our finance operations reported net income of $342 million and $133 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to $349 million and $246 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  Finance operations results for the first half of fiscal 2017 decreased compared to the same period in fiscal 2016, driven by a $466 million increase in depreciation on operating leases and a $63 million increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $331 million increase in operating lease revenues, a $91 million increase in investment and other income, net, and a $107 million decrease in interest expense.  Finance operations results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased compared to the same period in fiscal 2016, primarily due to a $237 million increase in depreciation on operating leases, a $94 million increase in interest expense and a $56 million increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $136 million increase in operating lease revenues, a $78 million increase in investment and other income, net, and a $70 million decrease in provision for income taxes. 
 Financing Revenues 
 Total financing revenues increased 8 percent and 6 percent during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 due to the following: 

Operating lease revenues increased 9 percent and 8 percent in the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher average outstanding earning asset balances, partially offset by lower portfolio yields.     

Retail contract revenues decreased slightly in the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 due to lower average outstanding earning asset balances, largely offset by an increase in our portfolio yields.     

Dealer financing revenues increased 11 percent and 13 percent in the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in our portfolio yields as well as higher average outstanding earning asset balances.     

 Our total portfolio yield, which includes operating lease, retail and dealer financing revenues, decreased to 3.3 percent and 3.2 percent during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to 3.7 percent for the same periods in fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower operating lease portfolio yields. 
   
 51 

Depreciation on Operating Leases  
 Depreciation on operating leases increased 17 percent and 16 percent during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The increase in depreciation was attributable to an increase in average operating lease units outstanding as well as deterioration in actual and expected used vehicle values for Toyota and Lexus vehicles during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016. 
 52 

Interest Expense  
 Our liabilities consist mainly of fixed and floating rate debt, denominated in various foreign currencies, which we issue in the global capital markets, while our assets consist primarily of U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate receivables.  We enter into interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps and foreign currency swaps to hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks that result from the different characteristics of our assets and liabilities.  The following table summarizes the consolidated components of interest expense: 

During the first half of fiscal 2017, total interest expense decreased to $604 million from $711 million in the same period in fiscal 2016.  The decrease in total interest expense for the first half of fiscal 2017 can be primarily attributed to gains on U.S. dollar non-hedge accounting interest rate swaps and non-hedge accounting debt denominated in foreign currencies, net of foreign currency swaps as compared to losses for the same period in fiscal 2016.  These gains were partially offset by an increase in interest expense on debt and derivatives in the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, interest expense increased to $297 million from $203 million in the same period in fiscal 2016.  The increase in total interest expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by lower gains on non-hedge accounting debt denominated in foreign currencies, net of foreign currency swaps, as well as an increase in interest expense on debt and derivatives.   
 Interest expense on debt primarily represents contractual net interest settlements and changes in accruals on secured and unsecured notes and loans payable and commercial paper, and includes amortization of discounts, premiums, debt issuance costs, and basis adjustments.  Interest expense on debt in the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 increased to $736 million and $377 million, respectively, from $630 million and $307 million in the same periods in fiscal 2016 due to the impact of higher weighted average interest rates on our commercial paper and our secured notes and loans payable. 
 Interest  (income) expense on derivatives represents contractual net interest settlements and changes in accruals on both hedge and non-hedge accounting interest rate and foreign currency derivatives.  During the first half of fiscal 2017, we recorded net interest income of $7 million compared to net interest income of $5 million in the same period in fiscal  2016 .  During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded net interest income of $5 million compared to net interest expense of $6 million in the same period of fiscal 2016.  
 Gain or loss on non-hedge accounting debt denominated in foreign currencies represents the impact of translation adjustments.  We use non-hedge accounting foreign currency swaps to economically hedge the debt denominated in foreign currencies. During the first half of fiscal 2017, the net gains of $30 million on our debt denominated in foreign currencies, net of foreign currency swaps, resulted primarily from a decrease in most foreign currency swap rates in which our debt is denominated.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, changes in debt denominated in foreign currencies directly offset changes in foreign currency swaps as a result of minimal changes in foreign currency swap rates.  During the first half of fiscal 2016, we recorded net losses of $61 million on debt denominated in foreign currencies, net of foreign currency swaps, resulting from an increase in foreign currency swap rates.  For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we recorded net gains of $59 million on our debt denominated in foreign currencies, net of foreign currency swaps, resulting from a decrease in foreign currency swap rates. 
   
 53 

Gain or loss on U.S. dollar non-hedge accounting interest rate swaps represents the revaluation of interest rate swaps.  During t  he first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded gains of $95 million and $75 million, respectively, primarily as a result of an increase in U.S. dollar swap rates in the short and medium term tenors.  During the first half of fiscal 2016, we e  xperienced losses of $26 million on U.S. dollar non-hedge accounting interest rate swaps, due to a slight decrease in U.S. dollar swap rates in the medium and longer term tenors.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, U.S. dollar swap rates had a more   significant decrease in the medium and longer term tenors resulting in gains of $50 million.  
 Future changes in interest and foreign exchange rates could continue to result in significant volatility in our interest expense, thereby affecting our results of operations. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 We recorded a provision for credit losses of $213 million and $161 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to $150 million and $105 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The increase in the provision for credit losses for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 was due to higher default frequency and loss severity, and overall portfolio growth. 
 Operating and Administrative Expenses    
 Our operating and administrative expenses increased 4 percent and 8 percent during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The increase for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 is primarily due to higher information technology expenditures, resulting from enhancements to our core servicing systems.  We continue to incur expenses associated with the planned relocation of our headquarters to Plano, Texas.  We expect to incur additional expenses over the next few years relating to our planned relocation.

Insurance Operations  
 The following table summarizes key results of our Insurance Operations: 

Our insurance operations reported net income of $62 million and $30 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to $51 million and $19 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The increase in net income for the first half of fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to a $40 million increase in insurance earned premiums and contract revenues and a $21 million increase in investment and other income, net, largely offset by a $23 million increase in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and a $21 million increase in operating and administrative expenses.  The increase in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to the same period in fiscal 2016, was attributable to a $21 million increase in insurance earned premiums and contract revenues and a $20 million increase to investment and other income, net, largely offset by a $13 million increase in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses and a $13 million increase in operating and administrative expenses.  
 Agreements issued increased 10 percent during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The average number of agreements in force increased 14 percent during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The increases in the issued and the average in force agreements in both periods was primarily due to increased sales of prepaid maintenance agreements, certified pre-owned warranties, guaranteed auto protection agreements and tire and wheel protection agreements. 
 Revenue from Insurance Operations 
 Our insurance operations reported insurance earned premiums and contract revenues of $392 million and $199 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to $352 million and $178 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  Insurance earned premiums and contract revenues represent revenues from in force agreements and are affected by sales volume as well as the level, age, and mix of in force agreements.  Insurance earned premiums and contract revenues are recognized over the term of the agreements in relation to the timing and level of anticipated claims and administrative expenses.  The increase in the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the average in force agreements.   
   
 55 

Our insurance operations reported investment and other income, net of $30 million and $12 million for the first half and second quart  er of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to $9 million and a loss of $8 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  Investment and other income, net consists primarily of dividend and interest income, realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary i  mpairment on available-for-sale securities, if any.    The increase in investment and other income, net for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in other-than-temporary i  mpairment on our fixed income mutual funds, partially offset by a decrease in dividend income.  
 Insurance Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 Our insurance operations reported insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses of $180 million and $91 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to $157 million and $78 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred are a function of the amount of covered risks, the frequency and severity of claims associated with in force agreements and the level of risk retained by our insurance operations.  Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses include amounts paid and accrued for reported losses, estimates of losses incurred but not reported, and any related claim adjustment expenses. The increase  in the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016  was primarily due to an increase in the number of prepaid maintenance claims as a result of a higher number of average in force agreements and an increase in the severity of prepaid maintenance claims. 
 Operating and Administrative Expenses 
 Our insurance operations reported operating and administrative expenses of $144 million and $75 million for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to $123 million and $62 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The increase  in the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016  was attributable to higher insurance dealer back-end program expenses and product expenses driven by the continued growth of our insurance business. Insurance dealer back-end program expenses are incentives or expense reduction programs we provide to dealers based on certain performance criteria. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Our overall provision for income taxes for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $241 million and $95 million, respectively, compared to $231 million and $161 million for the same periods in fiscal 2016.  Our effective tax rate was 37 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to 37 percent and 38 percent for the same periods in fiscal 2016, respectively. The change in the provision for income taxes for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 is consistent with the change in our income before tax compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  
 Vehicle Financing Volume and Net Earning Assets 
 The composition of our vehicle contract volume and market share is summarized below: 

l    
 
 Represents total domestic TMS sales of new Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles excluding sales under dealer rental car and commercial fleet programs and sales of a private Toyota distributor.  TMS new sales volume is comprised of 84 percent Toyota and Scion and 16 percent Lexus for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016.    

2    
 
 Total financing volume is comprised of approximately 79 percent Toyota and Scion, 18 percent Lexus, and 3 percent non-Toyota/Lexus for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016.    

3    
 
 Represents the percentage of total domestic TMS sales of new Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles financed by us, excluding sales under dealer rental car and commercial fleet programs and sales of a private Toyota distributor.    

 57 

Vehicle Financing Volume  
 The volume of our retail and lease contracts, which are acquired primarily from Toyota and Lexus dealers, is substantially dependent upon TMS new sales volume.  Vehicle sales by TMS decreased 3 percent and 2 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, largely due to a decrease in demand for new vehicles as compared to recent years.  Our financing volume decreased 7 percent for the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased competition from financial institutions and a decline in demand for new vehicles.  Overall market share decreased 4 percentage points and 5 percentage points, respectively, in the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased competition from financial institutions.  
 The composition of our net earning assets is summarized below:  

1    
 
 Includes wholesale and other credit arrangements in which we participate as part of a syndicate of lenders.    

 Retail Contract Volume and Earning Assets 
 Our new retail contract volume decreased 12 percent and 8 percent and our retail market share decreased 4 percentage points and 2 percentage points during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016.  The decreases in retail contract volume and market share are primarily due to increased competition from financial institutions and a decline in demand for new vehicles. Despite decreases in new retail contract volume and market share, our retail finance receivables, net increased 1 percent at September 30, 2016 as compared to March 31, 2016 as the average amount financed has increased. 
 Lease Contract Volume and Earning Assets 
 Our lease contract volume decreased 3 percent and 7 percent and our lease market share decreased 1 percentage point and 3 percentage points during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016.  Much of the decrease in both lease financing volume and market share during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017 was attributable to increased competition from financial institutions and a decline in the volume of subvened contracts.  Despite the decrease in lease financing volume and market share, our investments in operating leases, net increased 3 percent at September 30, 2016, as compared to the balance at March 31, 2016 due to lease portfolio growth in recent years.   
 Dealer Financing and Earning Assets 
 Dealer financing, net at September 30, 2016, decreased 3 percent  from March 31, 2016 due to decreases in dealer inventory outstanding and a decline in  the total number of dealers receiving financing .  
 58 

Residual Value Risk  
 The primary factors affecting our exposure to residual value risk are the levels at which residual values are established at lease inception, current economic conditions and outlook, projected end-of-term market values, and the resulting impact on lease return rates and loss severity. 
 On a quarterly basis, we review the estimated end-of-term market values of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of our carrying values.  To the extent the estimated end-of-term market value of a leased vehicle is lower than the residual value established at lease inception, the residual value of the leased vehicle is adjusted downward so that the carrying value at lease end will approximate the estimated end-of-term market value.  For investments in operating leases, adjustments are made on a straight-line basis over the remaining terms of the lease contracts and are included in Depreciation on operating leases in the Consolidated Statement of Income as a change in accounting estimate.   
 Depreciation on Operating Leases 
   
 Depreciation on operating leases and average operating lease units outstanding are as follows:  

Depreciation expense on operating leases increased 17 percent and 16 percent during the first half and second quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively, as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016, due primarily to an increase in the average operating lease units outstanding as well as deterioration in actual and expected used vehicle values for Toyota and Lexus vehicles.  The increase in the lease portfolio over the past several years, in addition to higher volume of shorter term leases originated in the last few years, will result in maturities increasing 37 percent in fiscal 2017.  We expect higher maturities to continue in the future as a result of higher leasing volume in recent years.  Higher average operating lease units outstanding and the resulting increase in future maturities or deterioration in actual and expected used vehicle values for Toyota and Lexus vehicles could unfavorably impact return rates, residual values, depreciation expense and the supply of used vehicles held for sale. 
 59 

Credit Risk  
 Credit Loss Experience 
 Our credit loss experience may be affected by a number of factors including the economic environment, our purchasing and servicing practices, used vehicle market conditions and subvention.  We continuously evaluate and refine our purchasing practices and collection efforts to minimize risk.  In addition, subvention contributes to our overall portfolio quality, as subvened contracts typically have higher credit scores than non-subvened contracts. 
   
 The following table provides information related to our credit loss experience: 

2       
 
 Average loss per unit upon disposition of repossessed vehicles or charge-off prior to repossession.    

3       
 
 Substantially all retail, direct finance lease and operating lease receivables do not involve recourse to the dealer in the event of customer default.    

4       
 
 Includes accounts in bankruptcy and excludes accounts for which vehicles have been repossessed.    

 The level of credit losses primarily reflects two factors: default frequency and loss severity.  Net charge-offs as a percentage of average gross earning assets increased from 0.31 percent at September 30, 2015 to 0.43 percent at September 30, 2016 due to increased default frequency and loss severity.  Default frequency as a percentage of outstanding contracts increased to 1.46 percent for the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to 1.19 percent in the same period in fiscal 2016 as a result of higher delinquencies.  Our delinquencies increased to 0.33 percent for first half of fiscal 2017 compared to 0.31 percent in the same period in fiscal 2016 as a result of higher consumer debt levels.   The increase in our delinquencies from March 31, 2016 to September 30, 2016 reflects our typical seasonal pattern for delinquency.   Our average loss severity for the first half of fiscal 2017 increased to $7,631 from $6,491 in the first half of fiscal 2016 due primarily to declines in used vehicle values for Toyota and Lexus vehicles.   
 60 

Allowance for Credit Losses  
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses to cover probable and estimable losses as of the balance sheet date resulting from the non-performance of our customers and dealers under their contractual obligations.  The determination of the allowance involves significant assumptions, complex analyses, and management judgment. 
 The allowance for credit losses for our consumer portfolio is established through a process that estimates probable losses incurred as of the balance sheet date based upon consistently applied statistical analyses of portfolio data.  This process utilizes delinquency migration analysis, in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio, and incorporates current and expected trends and other relevant factors, including used vehicle market conditions, economic conditions, unemployment rates, purchase quality mix, and operational factors.  This process, along with management judgment, is used to establish the allowance to cover probable and estimable losses incurred as of the balance sheet date.  Movement in any of these factors would cause changes in estimated probable losses. 
 The allowance for credit losses for our dealer portfolio is established by aggregating dealer financing receivables into loan-risk pools, which are determined based on the risk characteristics of the loan (e.g. secured by either vehicles, real estate or dealership assets).  We analyze the loan-risk pools using internally developed risk ratings for each dealer.  In addition, we have established procedures that focus on managing high risk loans in our dealer portfolio.  Our field operations management and special assets group are consulted each quarter to determine if any specific dealer loan is considered impaired.  If impaired loans are identified, specific reserves are established, as appropriate, and the loan is removed from the loan-risk pool for separate monitoring. 
 The following table provides information related to our allowance for credit losses: 

1    
 
   Amount relates to the commercial finance business which was sold on October 1, 2015.    

Our allowance for credit losses increased $53 million from $473 million at September 30, 2015 to $526 million at September 30, 2016 due to higher default frequency and loss severity and general portfolio growth.  Our allowance for credit losses decreased $9 million from March 31, 2016 to September 30, 2016 due to an improvement in the financial performance of certain dealers as well as a reduction in the specific reserves for certain impaired dealers, which was partially offset by higher default frequency and loss severity and general portfolio growth.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
 Liquidity risk is the risk relating to our ability to meet our financial obligations when they come due.  Our liquidity strategy is to ensure that we maintain the ability to fund assets and repay liabilities in a timely and cost-effective manner, even in adverse market conditions.  Our strategy includes raising funds via the global capital markets and through loans, credit facilities, and other transactions as well as generating liquidity from our earning assets.  This strategy has led us to develop a borrowing base that is distributed across a variety of markets, geographies, investors and financing structures, among other factors. 
 The following table summarizes the components of our outstanding funding sources at carrying value: 

1    
 
   Includes unamortized premium/discount.    

2

 Liquidity management involves forecasting and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet our cash needs, including unanticipated events.  To ensure adequate liquidity through a full range of potential operating environments and market conditions, we conduct our liquidity management and business activities in a manner that will preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility and diversity.  Key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on developing and maintaining direct relationships with commercial paper investors and wholesale market funding providers and maintaining the ability to sell certain assets when and if conditions warrant. 
 We develop and maintain contingency funding plans and regularly evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances, allowing us to assess how we will be able to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of capital is constrained.  The plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress, specify and quantify sources of liquidity, and outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period. In addition, we monitor the ratings and credit exposure of the lenders that participate in our credit facilities to ascertain any issues that may arise with potential draws on these facilities if that contingency becomes warranted. 
 We maintain broad access to a variety of domestic and global markets and may choose to realign our funding activities depending upon market conditions, relative costs, and other factors.  We believe that our funding sources, combined with operating and investing activities, provide sufficient liquidity to meet future funding requirements and business growth. Our funding volume is primarily based on the expected net change in earning assets and debt maturities. 
 For liquidity purposes, we hold cash in excess of our immediate funding needs.  These excess funds are invested in short-term, highly liquid and investment grade money market instruments, which provide liquidity for our short-term funding needs and flexibility in the use of our other funding sources.  We maintained excess funds ranging from $7.5 billion to $11.7 billion with an average balance of $9.6 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
 We may lend to or borrow from affiliates on terms based upon a number of business factors such as funds availability, cash flow timing, relative cost of funds, and market access capabilities. 
 Credit support is provided to us by our indirect parent Toyota Financial Services Corporation ( TFSC ), and, in turn to TFSC by Toyota Motor Corporation ( TMC ).  Taken together, these credit support agreements provide an additional source of liquidity to us, although we do not rely upon such credit support in our liquidity planning and capital and risk management.  The credit support agreements are not a guarantee by TMC or TFSC of any securities or obligations of TFSC or TMCC, respectively.  The fees paid pursuant to these agreements are disclosed in Note 14   Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

TMC s obligations under its credit support agreement with TFSC rank pari passu with TM  C s senior unsecured debt obligations.  Refer to Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31,   2016 for further discussion.  
 We routinely monitor global financial conditions and our financial exposure to our global counterparties, particularly in those countries experiencing significant economic, fiscal or political strain and the corresponding likelihood of default.  We do not currently have exposure to these or any other sovereign counterparties.  Refer to the  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity Facilities and Letters of Credit  section and  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - The failure or commercial soundness of our counterparties and other financial institutions may have an effect on our liquidity, operating results or financial condition  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 for further discussion. 
 Commercial Paper 
 Short-term funding needs are met through the issuance of commercial paper in the U.S.  Commercial paper outstanding under our commercial paper programs ranged from approximately $26.4 billion to $29.2 billion during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, with an average outstanding balance of $27.6 billion.  Our commercial paper programs are supported by the liquidity facilities discussed under the heading  Liquidity Facilities and Letters of Credit.   We believe we have ample capacity to meet our short-term funding requirements and manage our liquidity. 
 Unsecured Notes and Loans Payable 
 The following table summarizes the components of our unsecured notes and loans payable: 

1    
 
 Amounts represent par values and as such exclude unamortized premium/discount, debt issuance costs, fair value adjustments to debt in hedge accounting relationships, accrued redemption premiums, and the unamortized fair value adjustments on the hedged item for terminated hedge accounting relationships.      

2    
 
 MTNs and domestic bonds issued during the first half of fiscal 2017 had terms to maturity ranging from approximately 1 year to 30 years, and had interest rates at the time of issuance ranging from 1 percent to 3.1 percent.    

3    
 
 Consists of long-term borrowings, with terms to maturity ranging from approximately 1 year to 5 years, and interest rates at the time of issuance ranging from 0.6 percent to 2.75 percent.    

4    
 
 Consists of fixed and floating rate debt and other obligations.  Upon the issuance of fixed rate debt and other obligations, we generally elect to enter into pay float interest rate swaps.  Refer to  Derivative Instruments  for further discussion.    

63 

We maintain a shelf registration statement with the SEC to provide for the issuance of debt securities in t  he U.S. capital markets to retail and institutional investors. We qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules, which allows us to issue under our registration statement an unlimited amount of debt securities during the three year period ending   February 2018  .  Debt securities issued under the U.S. shelf registration statement are issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture which requires TMCC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge and cross-default provisions.  We are curren  tly in compliance with these covenants.  
 Our EMTN program, shared with our affiliates Toyota Motor Finance (Netherlands) B.V., Toyota Credit Canada Inc. and Toyota Finance Australia Limited (TMCC and such affiliates, the  EMTN Issuers ), provides for the issuance of debt securities in the international capital markets.  In September 2016, the EMTN Issuers renewed the EMTN program for a one year period.  The maximum aggregate principal amount authorized under the EMTN Program to be outstanding at any time is  50.0 billion or the equivalent in other currencies, of which  27.0 billion was available for issuance at September 30, 2016.  The authorized amount is shared among all EMTN Issuers.  The authorized aggregate principal amount under the EMTN program may be increased from time to time.  Debt securities issued under the EMTN program are issued pursuant to the terms of an agency agreement.  Certain debt securities issued under the EMTN program are subject to negative pledge provisions.  Debt securities issued under our EMTN program prior to October 2007 are also subject to cross-default provisions.  We are currently in compliance with these covenants. 
 TMCC has entered into term loan agreements with various banks.  These term loan agreements contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  We are currently in compliance with these covenants and conditions.  In addition, we may issue other debt securities through the global capital markets or enter into other unsecured financing arrangements. 
 Secured Notes and Loans Payable 
 Overview 
 Asset-backed securitization of our earning asset portfolio provides us with an alternative source of funding.  We securitize finance receivables and beneficial interests in investments in operating leases ( Securitized Assets ) using a variety of structures.  Our securitization transactions involve the transfer of Securitized Assets to bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities.  These bankruptcy-remote entities are used to ensure that the Securitized Assets are isolated from the claims of creditors of TMCC and that the cash flows from these assets are available solely for the benefit of the investors in these asset-backed securities.  Investors in asset-backed securities do not have recourse to our other assets, and neither TMCC nor our affiliates guarantee these obligations.  We are not required to repurchase or make reallocation payments with respect to the Securitized Assets that become delinquent or default after securitization.  As seller and servicer of the Securitized Assets, we are required to repurchase or make a reallocation payment with respect to the underlying assets that are subsequently discovered not to have met specified eligibility requirements.  This repurchase obligation is customary in securitization transactions. 
 We service the Securitized Assets in accordance with our customary servicing practices and procedures.  Our servicing duties include collecting payments on Securitized Assets and submitting them to a trustee for distribution to security holders and other interest holders.  We prepare monthly servicer certificates on the performance of the Securitized Assets, including collections, investor distributions, delinquencies, and credit losses.  We also perform administrative services for the special purpose entities. 
 Our use of special purpose entities in securitizations is consistent with conventional practice in the securitization market.  None of our officers, directors, or employees hold any equity interests or receive any direct or indirect compensation from our special purpose entities.  These entities do not own our stock or the stock of any of our affiliates.  Each special purpose entity has a limited purpose and generally is permitted only to purchase assets, issue asset-backed securities, and make payments to the security holders, other interest holders and certain service providers as required under the terms of the transactions. 
   
 64 

Our securitizations are structured to provide credit enhancement to reduce the risk of loss to security holders and other interest holders in the asset-backed securities.  Credit enhancement may include some or all of the fo  llowing:  

Overcollateralization  :  The principal of the Securitized Assets that exceeds the principal amount of the related secured debt.     

Excess spread  :  The expected interest collections on the Securitized Assets that exceed the expected fees and expenses of the special purpose entity, including the interest payable on the debt, net of swap settlements, if any.     

Cash reserve funds:    A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of asset-backed securities may be held by the securitization trust in a segregated reserve fund and may be used to pay principal and interest to security holders and other interest holders if collections on the underlying receivables are insufficient.     

Yield supplement arrangements  :  Additional overcollateralization may be provided to supplement the future contractual interest payments from securitized receivables with relatively low contractual interest rates.     

Subordinated notes  :  The subordination of principal and interest payments on subordinated notes may provide additional credit enhancement to holders of senior notes.     

 In addition to the credit enhancement described above, we may enter into interest rate swaps with our special purpose entities that issue variable rate debt.  Under the terms of these swaps, the special purpose entities are obligated to pay TMCC a fixed rate of interest on payment dates in exchange for receiving a floating rate of interest on notional amounts equal to the outstanding balance of the secured debt.  This arrangement enables the special purpose entities to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in issuing variable rate debt that is secured by fixed rate Securitized Assets. 
 Securitized Assets and the related debt remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We recognize financing revenue on the Securitized Assets.  We also recognize interest expense on the secured debt issued by the special purpose entities and maintain an allowance for credit losses on the Securitized Assets to cover estimated probable credit losses using a methodology consistent with that used for our non-securitized asset portfolio.  The interest rate swaps between TMCC and the special purpose entities are considered intercompany transactions and therefore are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. 
 Securitization 
 We maintain shelf registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to provide for the issuance of securities backed by Securitized Assets in the U.S. capital markets.  We regularly sponsor public securitization trusts that issue securities backed by retail finance receivables, including registered securities that we retain.  Funding obtained from our public term securitization transactions is repaid as the underlying Securitized Assets amortize.  None of these securities have defaulted, experienced any events of default or failed to pay principal in full at maturity.  As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we did not have any outstanding lease securitization transactions registered with the SEC. 
 We periodically enter into public term securitization transactions whereby we agree to use the proceeds solely to acquire retail and lease contracts financing new Toyota and Lexus vehicles of certain specified  green  models.  The terms of the securitization transaction are consistent with the terms of our other similar transactions except that the proceeds we receive are included in Restricted cash and cash equivalents in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, when applicable. 
 We also regularly execute private securitization transactions of Securitized Assets with bank-sponsored multi-seller asset-backed conduits.  Funding obtained from our private securitization transactions is repaid as the underlying Securitized Assets amortize.   
   
 65 

Liquidity Facilities and Letters of Credit  
 For additional liquidity purposes, we maintain syndicated credit facilities with certain banks. 
 364 Day Credit Agreement, Three Year Credit Agreement and Five Year Credit Agreement 
 In November 2015, TMCC, Toyota Credit de Puerto Rico Corp. ( TCPR ), and other Toyota affiliates entered into a $5.0 billion 364 day syndicated bank credit facility, a $5.0 billion three year syndicated bank credit facility and a $5.0 billion five year syndicated bank credit facility, expiring in fiscal 2017, 2019, and 2021, respectively. 
 The ability to make draws is subject to covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  These agreements may be used for general corporate purposes and none were drawn upon as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.  We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above. 
 Other Unsecured Credit Agreements 
 TMCC has entered into additional unsecured credit facilities with various banks.  As of September 30, 2016, TMCC had committed bank credit facilities totaling $5.4 billion, of which $1.9 billion, $775 million, $1.7 billion, and $1.0 billion mature in fiscal 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. 
 These credit agreements contain covenants and conditions customary in transactions of this nature, including negative pledge provisions, cross-default provisions and limitations on certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.  These credit facilities were not drawn upon as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016. We are currently in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit agreements described above. 
 Credit Ratings 
 The cost and availability of unsecured financing is influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation.  Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets.  Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating organization.  Each credit rating organization may have different criteria for evaluating risk, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each organization.  Our credit ratings depend in part on the existence of the credit support agreements of TFSC and TMC.  Refer to  Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on the credit ratings of TMCC and its parent companies and our credit support arrangements  in our fiscal 2016 Form 10-K. 

66 

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  
 Risk Management Strategy 
 Our liabilities consist mainly of fixed and floating rate debt, denominated in various currencies, which we issue in the global capital markets, while our assets consist primarily of U.S. dollar denominated, fixed rate receivables.  We enter into interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps and foreign currency swaps to hedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks that result from the different characteristics of our assets and liabilities.  Our use of derivative transactions is intended to reduce long-term fluctuations in the fair value of assets and liabilities caused by market movements.  All of our derivative activities are authorized and monitored by our management and our Asset-Liability Committee which provides a framework for financial controls and governance to manage market risk. 
 Accounting for Derivative Instruments 
 All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 We categorize derivatives as those designated for hedge accounting ( hedge accounting derivatives ) and those that are not designated for hedge accounting ( non-hedge accounting derivatives ).  At the inception of a derivative contract, we may elect to designate a derivative as a hedge accounting derivative. 
 We may also, from time-to-time, issue debt which can be characterized as hybrid financial instruments. These obligations often contain an embedded derivative which may require bifurcation.  Changes in the fair value of the bifurcated embedded derivative are reported in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  As of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we had no outstanding embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated. Refer to Note 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, and Note 7   Derivatives, Hedging Activities and Interest Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Derivative Assets and Liabilities 
 The following table summarizes our derivative assets and liabilities, which are included in Other assets and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet: 

Collateral represents cash received or deposited under reciprocal arrangements that we have entered into with our derivative counterparties.  As of September 30, 2016, we held collateral of $270 million, which offset derivative assets, and we posted collateral of $696 million, which offset derivative liabilities.  We also held excess collateral of $11 million which we did not use to offset derivative assets, and we posted excess collateral of $15 million which we did not use to offset derivative liabilities.  As of March 31, 2016, we held collateral of $320 million, which offset derivative assets, and we posted collateral of $718 million which offset derivative liabilities.  We held excess collateral of $2 million, which we did not use to offset derivative assets, and we posted excess collateral of $22 million which we did not use to offset derivative liabilities.   
   
 67 

Derivative Counterparty Credit Risk  
 We manage derivative counterparty credit risk by maintaining policies for entering into derivative contracts, exercising our rights under our derivative contracts, requiring the posting of collateral and actively monitoring our exposure to counterparties. 
 All of our derivative counterparties to which we had credit exposure at September 30, 2016 were assigned investment grade ratings by a credit rating organization.  Our counterparty credit risk could be adversely affected by deterioration of the global economy and financial distress in the banking industry. 
 Our International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) Master Agreements contain reciprocal collateral arrangements which help mitigate our exposure to the credit risk associated with our counterparties.  As of September 30, 2016, we have daily valuation and collateral exchange arrangements with all of our counterparties.  Our collateral agreements with substantially all our counterparties include a zero threshold, full collateralization requirement, which has significantly reduced counterparty credit risk exposure.  Under our ISDA Master Agreements, cash is the only permissible form of collateral.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to hold collateral in a segregated account.  Our collateral agreements include legal right of offset provisions, pursuant to which collateral amounts are netted against derivative assets or derivative liabilities, the net amount of which is included in Other assets or Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 In addition, many of our ISDA Master Agreements contain reciprocal ratings triggers providing either party with an option to terminate the agreement and related transactions at market value in the event of a ratings downgrade below a specified threshold.  Refer to  Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our fiscal 2016 Form 10-K for further discussion. 
 A summary of our net counterparty credit exposure by credit rating (net of collateral held) is presented below: 

We exclude from the table above credit valuation adjustments of $2 million as of September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 related to non-performance risk of our counterparties.  All derivative credit valuation adjustments are recorded in Interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.  Refer to Note 2   Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI  VE DISCLOSUR  ES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
 We have omitted this section pursuant to General Instruction H(2) of Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) evaluated the effectiveness of our  disclosure controls and procedures  as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules, regulations, and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

70 

PART II.  OTHE  R INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Litigation 
 Various legal actions, governmental proceedings and other claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  Certain of these actions are or purport to be class action suits, seeking sizeable damages and/or changes in our business operations, policies and practices.  Certain of these actions are similar to suits that have been filed against other financial institutions and captive finance companies.  We perform periodic reviews of pending claims and actions to determine the probability of adverse verdicts and resulting amounts of liability.  We establish accruals for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  When we are able, we also determine estimates of reasonably possible loss or range of loss, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability.  See Note 12   Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Given the inherent uncertainty associated with legal matters, the actual costs of resolving legal claims and associated costs of defense may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts for which accruals have been established.  Based on available information and established accruals, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the results of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS
