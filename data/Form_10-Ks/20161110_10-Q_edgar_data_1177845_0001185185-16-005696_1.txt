2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

The consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. These accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s fiscal 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2016.

Basis of consolidation and presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Xplore Technologies Corporation of America and Xplore Technologies International Corp.

Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. Estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, and would materially impact the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates, including those related to its revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, warranty reserves, tooling amortization, financial instruments, stock based compensation and income taxes. The estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from management s estimates and assumptions.

Motion Acquisition

On April 16, 2015, Xplore Technologies Corporation of America, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Foreclosure Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  Purchase and Sale Agreement ) with Motion Computing, Inc., Motion Computing Pty, Ltd., Motion Computing Holding Company, Inc. (collectively  Motion ) and Square 1 Bank, Motion s senior secured lender ( Square 1 ), pursuant to which the Company s subsidiary agreed to purchase certain of the assets of Motion, including cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, personal property and other assets of Motion for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9 million in cash, plus the assumption of approximately $6 million in certain liabilities, net of current assets, subject to the terms and conditions thereof (the  Motion Acquisition ). The assumed liabilities include certain accounts payable and obligations for service contracts and product warranties.  The closing of the Motion Acquisition occurred on April 17, 2015.

The Motion Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 805 Business Combinations (ASC 805).  The total purchase price for the Motion assets was approximately $9 million and was comprised of cash consideration paid by the Company to Square 1.

Under the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805, the total estimated purchase price of the acquired company is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Company has made significant estimates and assumptions in determining the preliminary allocation of the purchase price. The preliminary allocation of purchase consideration is subject to change based on further review of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The following table is the final allocation of the purchase price (in thousands, except years): 

Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given over the fair value of the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination and the potential synergy of combining the operations of the Company and Motion.  The Company expects the entire amount of goodwill recorded in this acquisition will be deducted for tax purposes ratably over a 15 year period.  The identified intangible assets consist of trademarks, copyrights, and developed technology, including patents.  The estimated fair values of the trademark, copyrights and developed technology were determined using the  Relief from Royalty  method.  Trademark, developed technology, non-compete and customer relationship will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  The Company expects the amortization of acquired intangibles will be approximately $400 per year for the remaining estimated useful lives.

Goodwill and other intangible assets  

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets received attributable to business acquisitions and combinations. Goodwill and other intangible assets are measured for impairment at least annually and/or whenever events and circumstances arise that indicate impairment may exist, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate. In assessing the value of goodwill, assets and liabilities are assigned to the reporting units and the appropriate valuation methodologies are used to determine fair value at the reporting unit level. Identified intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which are estimated to be between three and seven years.

Long-lived asset impairment  

Long-lived assets include property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. Definite-lived intangible assets consist of customer relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements. Long-lived assets are measured for impairment at least annually and/or whenever events and circumstances arise that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.

Cash and cash equivalents and liquidity

At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3,455, working capital of approximately $15,136 and total equity of approximately $29,249.  The Company s management believes that it has adequate cash and cash equivalents on hand and projected cash flow from operations to finance its operations for at least 12 months.

Foreign Currency Transactions

The Company does enter into transactions that are settled in a foreign currency.  The transactions are recorded in U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate in effect at the time a transaction is initiated.  When a transaction is settled, the foreign currency received to settle the transaction is converted to U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate in effect at the time of settlement.  A realized foreign currency exchange gain or loss is recorded based on the difference in the exchange rate in effect when a transaction is initiated, and the exchange rate in effect when a transaction is settled.  For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company reported a loss in foreign currency transactions of $99 and a gain in foreign currency transactions of $104, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended the existing accounting standards for employee share-based payment arrangements. The amendments require all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with share-based payments to be recognized as income tax expense or income tax benefit, respectively, rather than as additional paid-in capital. The amendments also increase the amount an employer can withhold in order to cover income taxes on awards, allows companies to recognize forfeitures of awards as they occur, and requires companies to present excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of these amendments on its Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

In February 2016, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for leases. The amendments require lessees to record, at lease inception, a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use ( ROU ) asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on their balance sheets. Lessees may elect to not recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets for most leases with terms of 12 months or less. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The ROU asset will be based on the liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, and the lessee s initial direct costs. For finance leases, lease expense will be the sum of interest on the lease obligation and amortization of the ROU asset, resulting in a front-loaded expense pattern. For operating leases, lease expense will generally be recognized on a straight-line basis. The amended lessor accounting model is similar to the current model, updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue standard. The current sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance applicable to real estate, is also replaced with a new model for both lessees and lessors. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of these amendments on its Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

4. LOSS PER SHARE

Loss per share has been computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during the period, and is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The effects of the options granted under the Company s option plans, the exercise of outstanding options and the exercise of outstanding warrants were excluded from the loss per share calculations for the periods presented as their inclusion is anti-dilutive. Accordingly, diluted loss per share has not been presented.

The following securities were not considered in the loss per share calculations for the three and six months ended:

5. SHORT-TERM INDEBTEDNESS

On April 17, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement in connection with the consummation of the Motion Acquisition.  The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Square 1 (the  Square 1 Credit Agreement ) pursuant to which Square 1 agreed to provide revolving loans of up to an aggregate principal amount of $15 million to the Company s subsidiary. The Square 1 Credit Agreement has a two-year term. Payment and performance under the Square 1 Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in and to substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Square 1 Credit Agreement, the loans consist of formula revolving loans and non-formula revolving loans. The maximum amount of formula revolving loans outstanding at any one time cannot exceed the lesser of $15 million or 85% of eligible accounts receivable of the Company s subsidiary. The maximum amount of non-formula revolving loans outstanding at any one time could not exceed $4 million through April 16, 2016, and thereafter steps-down in $480 increments every three months until the cap reaches $2.08 million, which will be maximum allowable amount outstanding at any one time thereafter until the maturity date.  The interest rate on the loans is variable, and will be equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time plus 1.25% per annum, provided that the interest rate on any day shall not be less than 4.5% per annum.

The Square 1 Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant regarding liquidity, which is tested monthly.  Failure to meet such covenant or the triggering of other events of default could result in acceleration of all payment obligations and the termination of the obligations of Square 1 to make loans and extend credit under the Square 1 Credit Agreement. The Square 1 Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties that must be made and certain other conditions that must be met for the Company and its subsidiary to cause Square 1 to make loans. The Square 1 Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and remedies upon default including acceleration. The Company agreed to a financial covenant requiring that the sum of the aggregate undrawn portion of the loans available under the Square 1 Credit Agreement plus the aggregate amount of all non-restricted cash and cash equivalents of the Company as shown on the Company s monthly financial statements provided to Square 1, as required under the Square 1 Credit Agreement, shall be at least $3 million.

On September 30, 2016, there was $9,246 in borrowings under the Square 1 Credit Agreement.

6. SHARE CAPITAL

The Company s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, has established the number of authorized shares of common stock of the Company as 15,000,000 and the number of authorized shares of preferred stock of the Company as 5,000,000.

Warrants Outstanding

At September 30, 2016, there were warrants to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock outstanding, all of which are fully exercisable, as detailed in the table below:

(1)

Exercise price may change subject to anti-dilutive terms.

Issuance of Dividend

On July 1, 2016, the Company s board of directors (the  Board of Directors ), declared a dividend of one right (a  Right ) for each of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.  The dividend was paid to the stockholders of record at the close of business on July 15, 2016. Each Right entitles the registered holder, subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement (as defined below), to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Company s Series E Participating Preferred Stock (the  Preferred Stock ) at a price of $14.40 (the  Exercise Price ), subject to certain adjustments.  The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement dated as of July 15, 2016 (the   Rights Agreement ) between the Company and American Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC, as Rights Agent.

The Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the tenth business day after a public announcement or filing that a person has, or group of affiliated or associated persons or persons acting in concert have, become an  Acquiring Person,  which is defined as a person or group of affiliated or associated persons or persons acting in concert who, at any time after the date of the Rights Agreement, have acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock, subject to certain exceptions or (ii) the close of business on the tenth business day after the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any person becoming an Acquiring Person (the earlier of such dates being called the  Distribution Date ). 

The Rights, which are not exercisable until the Distribution Date, will expire prior to the earliest of (i) July 1, 2019 or such later day as may be established by the Board of Directors prior to the expiration of the Rights, provided that the extension is submitted to the Company s stockholders for ratification at the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company.

Each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a preferential per share quarterly dividend payment equal to the greater of (i) $1.00 per share or (ii) an amount equal to 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of common stock. Each share of Preferred Stock will entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of common stock are converted or exchanged, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per one share of common stock.

The Exercise Price payable, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Preferred Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the then-current market price of the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends or dividends payable in Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). The number of outstanding Rights and the number of one one-thousandths of a Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of each Right are also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividends and other similar transactions.

In the event that, after a person or a group of affiliated or associated persons has become an Acquiring Person, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, or 50% or more of the Company s assets or earning power are sold, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then-current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a market value at the time of that transaction equal to two times the Exercise Price.

10 

Table of Contents 

With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Exercise Price will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent in the Exercise Price. No fractional shares of Preferred Stock will be issued (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts) and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of exercise.

At any time after any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition of beneficial ownership by such Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, the Board of Directors, at its option, may exchange each Right (other than Rights owned by such person or group of affiliated or associated persons which will have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of two shares of common stock per outstanding Right (subject to adjustment).

At any time before any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, the Board of Directors may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right (subject to certain adjustments). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.

The Board of Directors may amend or supplement the Rights Agreement without the approval of any holders of Rights, including, without limitation, in order to (a) cure any ambiguity, (b) correct inconsistent provisions, (c) alter time period provisions or (d) make additional changes to the Rights Agreement that the Board of Directors deems necessary or desirable. However, from and after any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, the Rights Agreement may not be supplemented or amended in any manner that would adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights.

7. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN

a)  Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units

On July 28, 2009, the Board of Directors adopted the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Stock Plan ). The Stock Plan provides for equity based awards in the form of incentive stock options and non-statutory options, restricted shares, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units. Awards are made to selected employees, directors and consultants to promote stock ownership among award recipients, encourage their focus on strategic long-range corporate objectives, and attract and retain exceptionally qualified personnel. The exercise price of an option is determined at the date of grant and is based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the stock exchange or quotation system on which the common stock is listed or traded on the day of grant. Unless otherwise provided for, the options are exercisable only during the term of engagement of the employee, officer or consultant or during the period of service as a director of the Company. The Stock Plan became effective as of June 10, 2009 and was approved by the Company s stockholders on January 14, 2010.

On March 24, 2016, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Stock Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock issuable under the plan to three million shares.

On August 3, 2016, the Company granted to an officer of the Company 30,000 restricted stock units ( RSUs ) valued at $71,700, based upon the closing price of the Company s common stock of $2.39 per share on the date of grant.  These RSUs have a three year vesting schedule.

A summary of the stock option activity in the Stock Plan during the six months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:

Table of Contents 

A summary of the RSU activity in the Stock Plan during the six months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:

At September 30, 2016, the total number of shares of common stock issued in connection with the exercise of options since the inception of the Stock Plan was 171,927 and the total number of shares of common stock issued in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards was 4,268.

A summary of the options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016 was as follows:

The weighted average exercise price of options exercisable at September 30, 2016 was $5.41 per share.

The options have been valued separately using the Black Scholes methodology. The options under the Stock Plan generally vest over a three-year period in equal annual amounts and expire five years after the issuance date.

The Company recorded stock compensation cost of $127 and $492 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded stock compensation cost of $302 and $1,099 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This expense was recorded in the employee related functional classification.

Compensation expense has been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for options and RSUs granted in the current fiscal year. The future compensation expense to be recognized for unvested option grants at September 30, 2016 was $757, which is to be recognized over the next three years.

b)  2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Board of Directors approved an employee stock purchase plan that was implemented on January 1, 2009 and approved by the Company s stockholders on November 4, 2009 (the  ESPP ).  The offering price per common share and number of common shares purchased for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

Overview

We are engaged in the development, integration and marketing of rugged mobile personal computer systems, or PCs. Our rugged tablet PCs are designed to withstand hazardous conditions, such as extreme temperatures, driving rain, repeated vibrations, dirt, dust and concussive shocks.  The intrinsically safe, ruggedized and reliable nature of our products facilitates the extension of traditional computing systems to a broader range of field personnel, including energy pipeline inspectors, public safety responders, warehouse workers and pharmaceutical scientists. Our tablets are fitted with a range of performance-matched accessories, including multiple docking solutions, wireless connectivity alternatives, global positioning system modules, biometric and smartcard options, as well as traditional peripherals, such as keyboards and cases.  Additionally, our most rugged tablets are waterproof for up to 30 minutes in water up to a depth of three feet, are impervious to drops from as high as seven feet, are readable in direct sunlight, can be mounted on vehicles and include LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity options for real-time data access.  Our end user customers include major telecommunications companies, leading heavy equipment manufacturers, oil and gas production companies, the military and first responders.

Until 2014, we competed and derived our revenue through the sale of our iX104 tablets in a subset of the rugged PC market, given the larger size and ultra-rugged attributes of our iX104 product family, which weighs approximately 5.4 pounds.  Since then, we have reduced our dependency upon the continued market acceptance of our iX104 systems by broadening the market for our products and increasing our opportunities for revenue growth.  We have broadened our product offering, through development and acquisition, to include multiple fully-rugged and rugged tablets that are lighter weight and less expensive than our iX104 family of products.  These new products have allowed us to compete in significantly larger segments of the rugged PC market.  In 2014, we introduced our first fully-rugged, lighter weight Android tablet and Windows tablet, and in 2015 we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Motion Computing, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which we refer to herein as Motion, in a transaction which we refer to herein as the Motion Acquisition.  This acquisition expanded our product lines to include multiple additional rugged tablet products, and expanded our domestic and international customer base.  We believe these lighter and less expensive tablets are ideal for field service applications and significantly more mobile market opportunities, as compared to our iX104.

Looking forward, our strategy is to build increased marketplace awareness of our product offerings, in an effort that we believe will enable us to increase our revenue and to expand our share of the markets addressed by those products.

We believe we are positioned for future revenue growth in the markets in which we compete.  We have introduced a family of computers that, based upon third party certifications, surpasses the performance standards and specifications that have been the accepted measuring sticks for rugged tablet computers in today s marketplace.

Critical Accounting Policies

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management believes that there have been no significant changes during the three months ended March 31, 2016 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements see Note 1,  Overview and Basis of Presentation , to the Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 1, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Results of Operations (in thousands of dollars)

Revenue.   We derive revenue from sales of our rugged wireless tablet PC systems, which encompass a family of active pen and touch tablet PC computers, embedded wireless, desktop, vehicle, fork-lift or truck docking stations and a range of supporting performance-matched accessories, peripherals and support services.  Our revenue also includes service revenue derived from out-of-warranty repairs and from separately priced extended warranty contracts which is deferred and recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the related contract period.

Cost of Revenue.   Cost of revenue consists of the costs associated with manufacturing, assembling and testing our products, related overhead costs, maintenance, compensation, freight and other costs related to manufacturing support, including depreciation of tooling assets and logistics.  We use contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and supporting components, which represents a significant majority of our cost of revenue.  In addition, the costs associated with providing warranty repairs, as well as the costs associated with generating service revenue, are included in cost of revenue.

Gross Profit.   Gross profit has been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including competition, product mix and average selling prices of products, maintenance, new product introductions and enhancements, the cost of components and manufacturing labor, fluctuations in manufacturing volumes, component shortages, the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold, and warranty costs.

Sales, Marketing and Support.   Sales, marketing and support expenses include salaries, commissions, agent fees and costs associated with co-operative marketing programs, as well as other personnel-related costs, travel expenses, advertising programs, trade shows and other promotional activities associated with the marketing and selling of our products.  We also believe part of our future success will be dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of resellers.

Product Research, Development and Engineering.   Product research, development and engineering expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for development and engineering personnel, and non-recurring engineering costs, including prototype costs, related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our product families.  We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred.  There may be components of our research and development efforts that require significant expenditures, the timing of which can cause quarterly fluctuation in our expenses.

General Administration.   General administration expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for finance, accounting, procurement and information technology personnel, investor relations, professional fees, including legal fees for litigation defense and litigation settlement payments, corporate expenses, and costs associated with being a U.S. public company, including regulatory compliance costs.

Interest.   Interest expense includes interest on borrowings or transaction processing fees related to our credit facility.

Other Income and Expense.   Other income and expense includes gains and/or losses on foreign currency balances, foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, dispositions of assets and other miscellaneous income and expense.

Inflation.   During the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we believe inflation and changing prices have not had material impact on our revenue or on net loss from continuing operations.

Foreign Currency Transactions.  The Company will enter into transactions that are settled in a foreign currency.  The transactions are recorded in U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate in effect at the time a transaction is initiated.  When a transaction is settled, the foreign currency received to settle the transaction is converted to U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate in effect at the time of settlement.  A realized foreign currency exchange gain or loss is recorded based on the difference in the exchange rate in effect when a transaction is initiated, and the exchange rate in effect when a transaction is settled

Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2016 vs. Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2015

Revenue.   Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $20,007, compared to $28,853 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $8,486, or approximately 31%.  This decline was a result of a decrease in unit sales of 14% and a decrease in the average selling price of 17%.  Total revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $36,480, compared to $52,896 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $16,416, or approximately 31%. This decline was a result of a decrease in unit sales of 21% and a decrease in the average selling price of 9%.  We believe that the decline in unit sales in fiscal 2017 is attributed to the pent up demand in the previous year for products that we were not able to ship in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to a disruption in the supply chain caused by the closing of a key screen manufacturing facility in South Korea.  The decline in average selling price is attributed to the mix of products sold, with a higher percentage being our lower priced XSLATE D10.

We operate in one segment, the sale of rugged mobile tablet PC systems. The United States accounted for approximately 73% and 72% of our total revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The United States accounted for approximately 69% and 73% of our total revenue for the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

We have a number of customers, and in any given period a single customer may account for a significant portion of our sales.  For the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, we had two customers located in the United States who accounted for approximately 53% and 41% of our revenue in each period.  For the three and six months ended September 30, 2015, we had two customers located in the United States who accounted for approximately 23% and 26% of our  revenue in each period.  At September 30, 2016, we had one customer with a receivable balance that totaled approximately 48% of our outstanding receivables.

Cost of Revenue.   Total cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $14,371, compared to $20,744 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $6,373, or approximately 31%.   Total cost of revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $25,980, compared to $36,637 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $20,847, or approximately 29%. The decline in cost of revenue in both periods is directly attributable to the decline in revenue discussed above.

We rely on three suppliers for the majority of our finished goods.  The inventory purchases and engineering services from these suppliers for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $20,779 and $22,419, respectively.  At September 30, 2016 and 2015, we owed these suppliers $5,257and $6,916, respectively, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.

Gross Profit.   Total gross profit decreased by $2,473 to $5,636 (28.2% of revenue) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $8,109,000 (28.1% of revenue) for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Total gross profit decreased by $20,847 to $10,500 (28.8% of revenue) for the six months ended September 30, 2016, from $16,259 (30.7% of revenue) for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in gross profit for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was due primarily to the decrease in revenues discussed above.  The decrease in the gross profit percentage in both periods was due to the changes in the product mix sold, and is consistent with our expectations based upon the performance of our current product lines.

Sales, Marketing and Support Expenses.   Sales, marketing and support expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $2,896, compared to $3,642 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease of $746, or approximately 20%, was due primarily to a decrease in headcount related costs of $753 and other marketing related expenses of $7.   Sales, marketing and support expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were $6,331, compared to $7,262 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $931, or approximately 13%. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in headcount related costs of $1,092, offset by an increase in marketing expense of $110 and various other expenses of $51. These savings were the result of our focus on cost management included in our efforts to improve future profitability.

Product Research, Development and Engineering Expenses.   Product research, development and engineering expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,317, a decrease of $260, or approximately 16%, compared to $1,577 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in these expenses was due primarily to a decrease in headcount related costs of $228, and changes in the product development schedule.  In any period we may be engaged in different stages of one or more product development efforts, resulting in different levels of related expenses.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we did not have the same level of product development activity as the prior year.  Product research, development and engineering expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were $2,270, a decrease of $1,137, or approximately 33%, compared to $3,407 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease is a result of incurring $863 less in product development in the current quarter, as compared to the same period last fiscal year, and a decrease in headcount costs of $274.

General Administration Expenses.   General administration expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,868, compared to $2,487 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $619, or approximately 25%.  The decrease primarily consists of a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $477 due to completion of the amortization of a grant of options to members of our Board of Directors and certain of our officers in April 2015 that were subject to a one year vesting, other payroll and general spending savings, and a positive variance in bad debt of $132. General administration expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were $3,907, compared to $4,818 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $911, or approximately 19%.  The decrease primarily consists of an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $780 and a favorable variance in bad debt of $128.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of employee stock-based compensation expense was $127 and $492, respectively.  For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the recorded employee stock-based compensation expense was $302, and $1,099, respectively.  The decrease in stock compensation expense was principally due to the full vesting of previously issued awards that were granted in prior periods having been completed in April of 2016.

Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $456 and $457, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $804 and $815, respectively.  The decrease was primarily due to completion of the depreciation period for certain tooling and other fixed assets, without needed replacement.  Depreciation and amortization is recorded in the related functional classification.

Interest Expense.   Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $69, compared to $52 expense for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $17.   Interest expense for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $77, compared to $58, for the six months ended September 30, 2015, and increase of $19.  The decrease in both periods was related to average debt balances under our credit facility being higher during the current period.

Other Income/Expense.   Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $91, compared to $305 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Other expense for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $195, compared to $918 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in both periods was related to integration expenses incurred in the previous year as a result of the Motion Acquisition.

Income Tax (Expense).   There was no income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Income tax expense for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $80, representing alternative minimum tax arising from the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, but paid and expensed in the current period.

Net Loss.  Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $536, compared to a net income of $98 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The net loss for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,283, compared to a net loss of $146,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase in net loss of $2,137. The increase in net loss was directly related to the lower revenues achieved during the current periods, as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Other than in fiscal years 2015 and 2013, we incurred net losses in each full fiscal year since our inception.  From inception, we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily from the gross proceeds of private and public sales of debt and equity securities totaling approximately $126.6 million.  As of September 30, 2016, our working capital was $15,136 and our cash and cash equivalents were $3,455.  

On April 17, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement in connection with the consummation of the Motion Acquisition.  We, along with our wholly-owned domestic subsidiary, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Square 1 Bank, pursuant to which Square 1 Bank agreed to provide revolving loans of up to an aggregate principal amount of $15 million to our subsidiary. The Square 1 Bank credit agreement has a two-year term. Payment and performance under the credit agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in and to substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the credit agreement, the loans consist of formula revolving loans and non-formula revolving loans. The maximum amount of formula revolving loans outstanding at any one time cannot exceed the lesser of $15 million or 85% of eligible accounts receivable of our subsidiary. The maximum amount of non-formula revolving loans outstanding at any one time could not exceed $4 million through April 16, 2016, and thereafter steps-down in $480,000 increments every three months until the cap reaches $2.08 million, which will be maximum allowable amount outstanding at any one time thereafter until the maturity date.

As of November 8, 2016, there was $8,425 in borrowings outstanding under the Square 1 Bank facility.

We believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations, working capital and capital spending needs for the next 12 months.

Cash Flow Results

The table set forth below provides a summary statement of cash flows for the periods indicated:

Net cash used in our operating activities was $10,488 for the six months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $6,875 for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3,613. The increase in net cash used by operating activities, while driven by an increase in our net loss for the year, was also impacted by our buildup in inventory of $4,293 related to anticipated shipments of our products in the coming quarters, and to meet our suppliers  minimum order quantities for some of our newer products and their accessories.  Favorable cash flow variances related to accounts receivable collections were partially offset by our use of that cash for the reduction of accounts payable.  While the reduction in accounts payable was less in the current period, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, that prior period included the pay down of significant accounts payable and accrued liabilities that we assumed in the Motion Acquisition.

Net cash used in investment activities for the six months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of investments in fixed assets of $652, mainly leasehold improvements of $242, software of $142, investments in demonstration units of $191 and other equipment and tooling of $77. Additionally, we paid $287 of additional liabilities we assumed in the Motion Acquisition.  For the six months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of the net cash of $669 we received in the Motion Acquisition, offset by investments in fixed assets of $300, mainly tooling of $232, and investments in demonstration units of $129.  The increased need for demonstration units was driven by our two new products introduced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.

Our financing activities used $9,246 of net cash for the six months ended September 30, 2016, entirely due to net borrowings under our bank facility. Our financing activities used $8,933 of net cash for the six months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to net repayments of our bank indebtedness of $3,865.  We received cash flows from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of $42.

(a)     Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our  disclosure controls and procedures  (as that term is defined under the Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of the period covered by this report that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.

(b)     Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.

At September 30, 2016, we were not involved in any legal actions, arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise.  From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  We believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters would not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or the results of operations.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016 includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.

Risks Relating to our Business

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had two customers that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.  If we are unable to replace revenue generated from one of our major resellers or end-user customers with revenue from others in future periods, our revenue may decrease and our growth would be limited.

Historically, in any given quarter a single customer, either reseller or end-user customer, could account for more than 10% of our revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, two customers located in the United States who accounted for approximately 53% of our total revenue.  If we are unable to replace revenue generated from our major customers, including resellers, with revenue from others our revenue may decrease and our growth would be limited.
