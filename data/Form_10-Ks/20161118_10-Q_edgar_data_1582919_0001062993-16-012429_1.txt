FLITWAYS TECHNOLOGY INC., formerly known as Cataca Resources,
Inc.    Notes to Condensed Financial Statements   (Unaudited)
   As of September 30, 2016    
  1.    Nature of the business  
 Flitways Technology Inc., formerly known as Cataca Resources,
Inc. (the  Company ), was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit
company on December 11, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of December 31.
The Company was initially engaged in the acquisition, exploration and
development of natural resource properties. On September 7, 2016, the Company
abandoned its mineral claim entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Share
Exchange Agreement ) with Flitways Technology Inc. ( Flitways ). The Company
refocused its efforts and is now involved in the  on demand  transportation
business providing businesses and private traveler s access to book and schedule
ground transportation online or by mobile device. The Company gives travelers
access to customizable travel rides through a network of ground travel
providers. It incorporates ride booking into the travel industry by making
travel ride booking available at various travel points of sale to allow
travelers to book rides that fit their lifestyle online and on its mobile
application. Effective November 9, 2016, the Company changed its name from
Cataca Resources, Inc. to Flitways Technology Inc.  
  2.      Summary of significant
accounting policies   
  Basis of Presentation     
 The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements are
presented in United States dollars and have been prepared using the accrual
method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and the
instructions for Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all
information and footnote disclosures necessary for a complete presentation of
the financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and stockholders 
deficit in conformity with GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations and
financial position have been included and all such adjustments are of a normal
recurring nature.  
 The unaudited condensed balance sheet of the Company as of
September 30, 2016, and the related balance sheet of the Company as of December
31, 2015, which is derived from the Company's audited financial statements as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the unaudited condensed statement
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
the unaudited condensed statement of cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 are included in this document. These unaudited
condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and related notes included in the Company s most recently
filed Form 10-K that was filed on March 28, 2016.  
 Unaudited interim results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. Therefore, period over period
comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future
periods.  
  Use of Estimates and Assumptions   
 The preparation of the Company s condensed financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the condensed financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FLITWAYS TECHNOLOGY INC., formerly known as Cataca Resources,
Inc.    Notes to Condensed Financial Statements   (Unaudited)
   As of September 30, 2016    
  2.      Summary of significant
accounting policies (continued)   
  Mineral Properties   
 Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized in
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) topic 930  Extractive Activities - Mining .
Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been
determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of
establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such
property are capitalized. 
  Subsequent Events   
 Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement with Flitways, which
became effective on October 14, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the issued
and outstanding shares of Flitways and in exchange Flitways issued to the
Company 20,000,000 restricted shares of its common stock. As a result of the
Share Exchange Agreement, Flitways became a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company. The transaction was accounted for as a reorganization and a  public
shell reverse merger  resulting in Flitways becoming a public company.  
 Subsequent to the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, the
Company entered into subscription agreements with various outside investors to
purchase 1,544,666 shares of the Company s common stock.  
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
 The Company s management has evaluated all the recently issued,
but not yet effective, accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by
the FASB or other standards-setting bodies through the filing date of these
condensed financial statements and does not believe the future adoption of any
such pronouncements will have a material effect on the Company s financial
position and results of operations or cash flows.  
  3.    Mineral claim   
 On December 17, 2012, the Company entered into Mineral Rights
Agreement with Benefacio Minerals LLC to purchase a 100% interest in a 9 unit
claim block (the  Lebak Gold Claim ), containing approximately 91.5 hectares,
located in the province of Sultan Kudarat, Philippines, for the sum of $5,000
(the  Assignment ). The Assignment was filed with the Mineral Resources
Department of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Government of
the Republic of the Philippines on December 20, 2012. On December 21, 2012, the
Republic of the Philippines, Department of Environment and Natural Resources
( DENR )   Mines and Geosciences granted the Company an annual license and
permit for mining and exploration of its Lebak Gold Claim (the  License and
Permit ). On December 17, 2013, the Company paid DENR $1,093 to renew its
License and Permit and was granted an annual extension to December 17, 2014. The
Company will be required to renew its License and Permit with the DENR prior to
commencing work the Lebak Gold Claim.  
 On September 6, 2016, the Company decided to abandon the Lebak
Gold Claim and disposed of the mineral claim. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company has no capitalized mineral property.

Inc.    Notes to Condensed Financial Statements   (Unaudited)
   As of September 30, 2016    
  4.      Related party
obligation payable   
 Due to related party at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 consisted of the following:  
 
 On December 1, 2013, March 31, July 18, and November 21, 2014,
January 29, April 13, April 24, May 8, June 5, July 30, December 8, 2015, and
March 14, 2016 Mr. Edward Barrios, the Company s President, CEO, and a Director,
advanced the Company $8,000, $10,000, $18,000 $4,000, $10,000, $4,000, $12,000,
$8,000, $15,000, $8,000, $8,000, and $20,000 as an unsecured obligation,
respectively. The aggregate obligation bore no interest, was due on demand and
was not evidenced by any written agreement.  
 On September 6, 2016, Mr. Barrios agreed to forgive the
aggregate obligation owed to him by the Company. The forgiveness of debt was
accounted for as a capital contribution.  
  5.      Going
concern   
 These condensed financial statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the
foreseeable future. Realization values may be substantially different from
carrying values as shown and these condensed financial statements do not give
effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and
classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2016, the Company had not yet
achieved profitable operations, had accumulated deficit of $157,657 since its
inception and expects to incur further losses in the development of its
business, all of which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon the Company s ability to generate future profitable operations
and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  
 Management of the Company believes that the Company s negative
working capital will continue to improve throughout the remainder of 2016.
Management expects the improvement to come from the Company s decision to
acquire Flitways mentioned in Note 2. Management anticipates that these
improvements will enable the Company to fund ongoing operations as well as
generate future revenues.  
  6.      Common stock
  
 The Company s capitalization is 75,000,000 shares of common
stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share, with 30,000,000 shares issued and
outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
  Safe Harbor Statement   
 This report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking
statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are
 forward-looking statements  for purposes of these provisions, including any
projections of earnings, revenues, or other financial items; any statements of
the plans, strategies, and objectives of management for future operation; any
statements concerning proposed new products, services, or developments; any
statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; statements of
belief; and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Such
forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the
forward-looking statements. 
 These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following: competition,
promotional costs, and risk of declining revenues. Our actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a
result of a number of factors. These forward-looking statements are made as of
the date of this filing, and we assume no obligation to update such
forward-looking statements. The following discusses our financial condition and
results of operations based upon our condensed financial statements which have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. It should be read in conjunction with our condensed
financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this
Form 10-Q. The discussions of results, causes and trends should not be construed
to imply any conclusion that these results or trends will necessarily continue
into the future.  
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   
  No Revenues   
 Since our inception to September 30, 2016, we have not yet
earned any revenues. As of September 30, 2016, we have an accumulated deficit of
$157,657. At this time, our ability to generate any significant revenues
continues to be uncertain.  
  Net Loss   
 Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
amounted to $12,256 and $31,168, respectively compared to our net loss for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $8,875 and $54,486,
respectively. The decrease in net loss for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was due
to a significant decrease in general and administrative expenses. The increase
in net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net loss
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was due to the disposition of the
mineral claim during the third quarter of 2016.  
  Expenses   
 Our total operating expenses for the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 were $7,256 and $26,168, respectively compared
to expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 of
$8,875 and $54,486. Our expenses were solely comprised of other general  
administrative expenses. 
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities   
 We have not generated positive cash flows from operating
activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in
operating activities was $24,537, compared to $54,265 for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2015.  
 8  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities   
 We have financed our operations primarily from related party
advancements. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 net cash
provided by financing activities was $20,000 compared to the nine month period
ended September 30, 2015, which was $57,000. 
  Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 As at September 30, 2016, we did not have any assets compared
to $9,537 in total assets at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, our
current liabilities were $2,657, which was comprised of accounts payable of
$2,561 and accrued liabilities of $96. Stockholders  deficit was $2,657 as of
September 30, 2016 compared to stockholders' deficit of $96,489 as of December
31, 2015. 
 These condensed financial statements have been prepared on the
assumption that we have the ability to continue as a going concern. Different
bases of measurement may be appropriate when a company is not expected to
continue operations for the foreseeable future. Our continuation as a going
concern is dependent upon our ability to attain profitable operations and
generate funds there-from, and/or raise equity capital or borrowings sufficient
to meet current and future obligations. Management plans to raise equity
financings over the next twelve months to finance operations. There is no
guarantee that we will be able to complete any of these objectives. We have
incurred losses from operations since inception and at September 30, 2016, have
an accumulated deficit that creates substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern.  
  Plan of Operation   
 Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to grow our
business through the expansion of our online booking engine and mobile app.  
  Going Concern   
 Our condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming
that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include
adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to
continue in operation.  
 We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long
term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through,
among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  
 Our independent auditors' audit report accompanying our
December 31, 2015 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph
expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a
going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy
our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.  
  Inflation   
 The amounts presented in the condensed financial statements do
not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position.
The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of
inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that
represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 As of September 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet
transactions that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.

 Not applicable.  
  ITEM
4.           CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES   
  Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.  
 Our Internal control over financial reporting is a process
that, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, was designed
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of our management and our trustees; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a
material effect on our financial statements.  
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
 As management, it is our responsibility to establish and
maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. As of September 30,
2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based
on our evaluation, we concluded that the Company maintained ineffective internal
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, based on criteria
established in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.
 
 This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of
the company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the
company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only
management's report in this quarterly report.  
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company's chief executive officer
and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation regarding the effectiveness
of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon the evaluation of
these controls and procedures, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
of the date of filing this annual report applicable for the period covered by
this report.  
  Changes in internal controls.  
 During the period covered by this report, no changes occurred
in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
