1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 Organization and Nature of Operations 
 Approach Resources Inc. ( Approach,  the  Company,   we,   us  or  our ) is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and gas properties.  We focus on finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves in oil shale and tight gas sands.  Our properties are primarily located in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We also own interests in the East Texas Basin. 
 Consolidation, Basis of Presentation and Significant Estimates 
 The interim consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited and contain all adjustments (consisting primarily of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year, due in part to the volatility in prices for oil, natural gas liquids ( NGLs ) and gas, future commodity prices for commodity derivative contracts, global economic and financial market conditions, interest rates, access to sources of liquidity, estimates of reserves, drilling risks, geological risks, transportation restrictions, the timing of acquisitions, product supply and demand, market competition and interruptions of production. You should read these consolidated interim financial statements in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, 2016. 
 The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.  In preparing the accompanying financial statements, management has made certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingencies. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant assumptions are required in the valuation of proved oil and gas reserves, which affect our estimate of depletion expense as well as our impairment analyses. Significant assumptions also are required in our estimation of accrued liabilities, commodity derivatives, income tax provision, share-based compensation and asset retirement obligations. It is at least reasonably possible these estimates could be revised in the near term, and these revisions could be material.  Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.  These classifications have no impact on the net loss reported. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting standards update for  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in  Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.  This accounting standard update provides new guidance concerning recognition and measurement of revenue and requires additional disclosures about the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This new guidance permits adoption through the use of either a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted. In July 2015, FASB delayed the effective date one year, making the new standard effective for interim periods and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We have not determined which transition method we will use and are continuing to evaluate our existing revenue recognition policies to determine whether any of our contracts will be affected by the new requirements. 
 In September 2015, FASB issued an accounting standards update for  Business Combinations,  which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. We adopted this new guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2016. This new guidance did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.  
 In February 2016, FASB issued an accounting standards update for  Leases,  which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This new guidance will be adopted under a modified retrospective approach, and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

    In March 2016, FASB issued an accounting standards update for  Compensation   Stock Compensation,  which amends existing guidance related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and financial statement presen  tation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies.  This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolida  ted financial statements.   
   
 2.  Earnings Per Common Share 
 We report basic earnings per common share, which excludes the effect of potentially dilutive securities, and diluted earnings per common share, which includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities unless their impact is antidilutive. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of our basic and diluted earnings per share (dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts). 

3. Long-Term Debt 
 The following table provides a summary of our long-term debt at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 (in thousands). 

Senior Secured Credit Facility 
   At September 30, 2016, the borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments under our amended and restated senior secured credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) were $325 million, with maximum commitments from the lenders of $1 billion. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of May 7, 2019.  The borrowing base is redetermined semi-annually based on our oil, NGL and gas

  reserves.  We, or the lenders, can each request one additional borrowing base redetermination each calendar year.     Our semi-annual borrowing base redetermination process is underway, but not yet final.  
 At September 30, 2016, borrowings under the Credit Facility bore interest based on the agent bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.50%, or the sum of the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.50%.  In addition, we pay an annual commitment fee of 0.50% of unused borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Margins vary based on the borrowings outstanding compared to the borrowing base of the lenders.  
 We had outstanding borrowings of $275 million under the Credit Facility at September 30, 2016, compared to $273 million of outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2015. The weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Facility for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was 3.8 %. We had outstanding unused letters of credit under the Credit Facility totaling $0.3 million at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, which reduce amounts available for borrowing under the Credit Facility. 
 Obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by mortgages on substantially all of the oil and gas properties of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company is required to grant liens in favor of the lenders covering the oil and gas properties of the Company and its subsidiaries representing at least 90% of the total value of all oil and gas properties of the Company and its subsidiaries. At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. 
 On May 3, 2016, we entered into a third amendment to the Credit Facility. The third amendment,  among other things, (a) decreased the borrowing base to  $325  million from $450 million, (b)   revised the Company s permitted ratio of EBITDAX (as defined in the Credit Facility)   to cash Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Facility) to 1.25 to 1.0 (or 1.0 to 1.0 following the issuance of second lien indebtedness), through December 31, 2017, 1.5 to 1.0 through December 31, 2018, and 2.0 to 1.0 thereafter; (c) increased the applicable margin rates on borrowings by 100 basis points, (d) permits the Company to issue up to $150 million of second lien indebtedness, subject to various conditions and limitations, (e) permits the Company to repurchase outstanding debt with proceeds of certain asset sales, equity issuances or second lien indebtedness, and (f) requires cash and cash equivalents in excess of $35 million held by the Company to be applied to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.  In connection with the third amendment to the Credit Facility, $0.6 million of debt issuance costs were written off as a result of the reduction in the borrowing base, and we incurred $0.2 million of debt issuance costs. 
 Covenants 
 The Credit Facility contains two principal financial covenants: 

a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant (as defined in the Credit Facility) that requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to cash Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Facility) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of not less than 1.25 to 1.0   (or 1.0 to 1.0 following the issuance of second lien indebtedness)   through December 31, 2017, a ratio of not less than 1.5 to 1.0 through December 31, 2018, and a ratio of not less than 2.0 to 1.0 thereafter, and       

a consolidated modified current ratio covenant (as defined in the Credit Facility) that requires us to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.     

 The Credit Facility also contains covenants restricting cash distributions and other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, incurrence of other debt, consolidations and mergers, the level of operating leases, asset sales, investment in other entities and liens on properties. 
 In addition, the obligations of the Company may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility). Events of Default include customary events for a financing agreement of this type, including, without limitation, payment defaults, the inaccuracy of representations and warranties, defaults in the performance of affirmative or negative covenants, defaults on other indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries, bankruptcy or related defaults, defaults related to judgments and the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Facility), which includes instances where a third party becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the Company s outstanding equity interests entitled to vote.

    Senior Notes  
 In June 2013, we completed our public offering of $250 million principal amount of 7% Senior Notes due 2021 (the  Senior Notes ). Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15. In August 2015, we repurchased a portion of our Senior Notes in the open market with an aggregate face value of $5 million for a purchase price of $3.5 million, including accrued interest.  This resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Subsequent to September 30, 2015, we repurchased a portion of our Senior Notes in the open market with an aggregate face value of $14.7 million, resulting in a gain of $9.1 million. At September 30, 2016, we had $230.3 million principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding.  
 We issued the Senior Notes under a senior indenture dated June 11, 2013, among the Company, our subsidiary guarantors and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as successor trustee to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The senior indenture, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated June 11, 2013, is referred to as the  Indenture.  
 As of June 15, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  If we sell certain of our assets or experience specific kinds of changes of control, we may be required to offer to purchase the Senior Notes from holders. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries, subject to certain customary release provisions. A subsidiary guarantor may be released from its obligations under the guarantee: 

in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a subsidiary guarantor, if the sale or other disposition otherwise complies with the Indenture;     

in connection with any sale or other disposition of the capital stock of that guarantor to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a subsidiary guarantor, if that guarantor no longer qualifies as a subsidiary of the Company as a result of such disposition and the sale or other disposition otherwise complies with the Indenture;     

if the Company designates any restricted subsidiary that is a guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the Indenture;     

upon defeasance or covenant defeasance of the notes or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, in each case, in accordance with the Indenture;     

upon the liquidation or dissolution of that guarantor, provided that no default or event of default occurs under the Indenture as a result thereof or shall have occurred and is continuing; or     

in the case of any restricted subsidiary that, after the issue date of the notes is required under the Indenture to guarantee the notes because it becomes a guarantor of indebtedness issued or an obligor under a credit facility with respect to the Company and/or its subsidiaries, upon the release or discharge in full from its (i) guarantee of such indebtedness or (ii) obligation under such credit facility, in each case, which resulted in such restricted subsidiary s obligation to guarantee the notes.     

The Indenture restricts our ability, among other things, to (i) sell certain assets, (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase, equity interests, (iii) incur additional debt, (iv) make certain investments, (v) enter into transactions with affiliates, (vi) incur liens and (vii) merge or consolidate with another company. These restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.  If at any time the Senior Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody s Investors Service and Standard   Poor s Ratings Services and no default (as defined in the Indenture) has occurred and is continuing, many of these restrictions will terminate.  The Indenture contains customary events of default. As further discussed in Note 9, on November 2, 2016, we entered into an exchange agreement with the largest holder of our Senior Notes. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, the closing of which is subject to stockholder approval, we will enter into a second supplemental indenture which, when effective upon the close of the exchange transaction, will remove certain events of default and covenants contained in the Indenture, and will remove all of the restrictions discussed above. 
 Subsidiary Guarantors 
   The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our consolidated subsidiaries.  Approach Resources Inc. is a holding company with no independent assets or operations. The subsidiary guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and  
 7 
 
 Approach Resources Inc. and Subsidiaries

 September 30, 2016 
   
  several, and any subsidiaries of the Company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor. There are no significant restrictions on the Company s ability, or the ability of any subsidiary guarantor, to obtain funds from its subsidiaries through dividend  s, loans, advances or otherwise.  
 At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants, and there were no existing defaults or events of default, under our debt instruments. 

4.  Commitments and Contingencies 
 Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating lease obligations, asset retirement obligations and employment agreements with our executive officers.  At September 30, 2016, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $275 million, compared to $273 million at December 31, 2015. Since December 31, 2015, there have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reached a legal settlement with a service provider of $1.1 million, which reduced our current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and is recorded as a reduction in additions to oil and gas properties on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business.  While we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings with certainty, we do not believe that an adverse result in any pending legal or regulatory proceeding, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to our consolidated financial condition or cash flows. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a contractual settlement of $1.4 million, which is recorded in other income on our consolidated statements of operations. 

5.  Income Taxes 
 The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was 35.1% and 35%, respectively.  Total income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, includes state taxes and the impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income.      
 The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was 35.5% and 35.6%, respectively. Total income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, differed from amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory tax rates to pre-tax income, due primarily to state taxes and the impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income. 

6.  Derivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurements 
 The following table provides our outstanding commodity derivative positions at September 30, 2016.

 Approach Resources Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
 September 30, 2016 
   
    After September 30, 2016, we entered into natural gas collars covering 100,000     MMBtu per month with a floor price of $3.00/MMBtu and a ceiling price of $3.65/MMBtu for   Ja  nuary 2017 through December 2017  , and natural gas collars covering 400,000     MMBtu per month with a floor price of $3.00/MMBtu and a ceiling price of $3.47/MMBtu for April 2017 through December 2017.  
   
 The following table summarizes the fair value of our open commodity derivatives as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 (in thousands). 

The following table summarizes the change in the fair value of our commodity derivatives (in thousands). 

Unrealized gains and losses, at fair value, are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non-current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts.  Changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations.  We estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange-quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities.  We internally valued the option contracts using industry-standard option pricing models and observable market inputs.  We use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.  Realized gains and losses are also included in income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations.   
 We are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions and have considered the exposure in our internal valuations. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions. 
 To estimate the fair value of our commodity derivatives positions, we use market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use the best available information. We determine the fair value based upon the hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  At September 30, 2016, we had no Level 1 measurements.     

Level 2   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or      

 9 
 
 Approach Resources Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
 September 30, 2016 

other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted   forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Our derivatives, which consist primarily of commodity swaps and collars,   are valued using commodity market data, which is derived by combining raw inputs and quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves. Where observable inputs are available, directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset o  r liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2.  At   September   30  , 2016, all of our commodity derivatives were valued using Level 2 measurements.     

Level 3   Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value.  The fair value of oil and gas properties used in estimating our recognized impairment loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, represents a nonrecurring Level 3 measurement. At September 30, 2016, we had no Level 3 measurements.     

 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  
 We recorded no impairment of our proved properties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Due to the impact of the decline in forward commodity prices during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, there were indications that the carrying values of certain of our oil and gas properties may be impaired and undiscounted cash flows attributable to these assets indicated their carrying amounts were not expected to be recovered. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized an impairment loss of $214.7 million related primarily to our vertical Canyon wells, due to the impact of the decline in forward commodity prices. At September 30, 2015, we had $22 million in value recorded for these properties, which was the estimated fair value. We estimated the fair value of the proved oil and gas properties and equipment using a discounted cash flow model, which is a Level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs used to determine the fair value include estimates of (i) future sales prices for oil and gas based on NYMEX strip pricing, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, and (vi) discount rates.  
  Certain leases outside of our core development project were impaired during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, as we did not plan to develop them. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of unproved property of $5.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value 
 The following table sets forth the fair values of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value on our financial statements (in thousands). 

The fair value of the Senior Notes is based on quoted market prices, but the Senior Notes are not actively traded in the public market. Accordingly, the fair value of the Senior Notes would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

7.  Termination Costs 
   
 In September 2015, we reduced our workforce to decrease costs and better align our workforce with the needs of our business and current oil and gas prices. In connection with the reduction, we incurred $1.4 million in expenses, which was recorded in termination costs on our consolidated statements of operations. We also recorded a benefit of $0.3 million in share-based compensation expense related to the forfeiture of outstanding unvested shares of restricted stock in connection with our workforce reduction, which was recorded in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of operations.

 In March 2016, we awarded 1,100,543 cash-settled performance awards, subject to certain performance conditions, and 550,272 shares, subject to three-year total shareholder return ( TSR ) conditions, assuming maximum TSR, were granted to our executive officers. The aggregate fair market value of the cash-settled shares and TSR shares, assuming target TSR is achieved, on the grant date was approximately $1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, to be expensed over a remaining service period of approximately 3.5 years, subject to performance and three-year TSR conditions. 
 The cash-settled performance awards represent a non-equity unit with a conversion value equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock at the vesting date. These awards are classified as liability awards due to the cash settlement feature. Compensation costs associated with the cash-settled performance awards are re-measured at each interim reporting period and an adjustment is recorded in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized $484,000 and $823,000 in expense, respectively, and at September 30, 2016, we recorded a liability of $823,000 related to the cash-settled performance awards in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  

9. Subsequent Events 
 On November 2, 2016, we entered into an exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with the largest holder of our Senior Notes to exchange $130,552,000 principal amount of our Senior Notes for 39,165,600 newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  Exchange ).  Accrued, unpaid interest on the Senior Notes held by the exchanging noteholder will be paid by the Company in cash at the closing of the Exchange. The Exchange is conditioned on stockholder approval. If the Exchange is approved by stockholders and closes, a second supplemental indenture will become effective, which will remove certain covenants and events of default from the Indenture governing our Senior Notes, and eliminate certain restrictive covenants discussed in Note 3. We also have agreed, subject to stockholder approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock, to offer to exchange our remaining  $99,768,000  principal amount of outstanding Senior Notes into shares of our common stock on similar economic terms to the holders of the remaining Senior Notes (the  Follow-On Exchange ).  
 The Exchange, if approved and closed, and the Follow-On Exchange, if approved and closed, are expected to reduce our interest expense and our outstanding long-term debt. Additionally, utilization of our federal net operating loss carryforwards likely will be limited as a result of the Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange. We are unable to quantify an estimate of the possible limitation of the utilization of our federal net operating loss carryforwards.

Overview 
 Approach Resources Inc. is an independent energy company focused on the exploration, development, production and acquisition of unconventional oil and gas reserves in the Midland Basin of the greater Permian Basin in West Texas, where we lease approximately 125,000 net acres as of September 30, 2016.  We believe our concentrated acreage position provides us an opportunity to achieve cost, operating and recovery efficiencies in the development of our drilling inventory.  Our long-term business strategy is to develop resource potential from the Wolfcamp shale oil formation.  Additional drilling targets could include the Clearfork, Canyon Sands, Strawn and Ellenburger zones.  We sometimes refer to our development project in the Permian Basin as  Project Pangea,  which includes  Pangea West.   Our management and technical team have a proven track record of finding and developing reserves through advanced drilling and completion techniques. As the operator of all of our estimated proved reserves and production, we have a high degree of control over capital expenditures and other operating matters. 
 At December 31, 2015, our estimated proved reserves were 166.6 million barrels of oil equivalent ( MMBoe ), made up of 33% oil, 30% NGLs, 37% gas and 37% proved developed reserves.  Substantially all of our proved reserves are located in the Permian Basin in Crockett and Schleicher counties, Texas.  At September 30, 2016, we owned working interests in 804 producing oil and gas wells. 
 Third Quarter and Current 2016 Activity 
   
  Although our long-term strategy remains to develop resource potential from the Wolfcamp shale oil formation, the growth of our reserves and production, as well as achievable rates of return, depends on commodity prices. During 2014-2015, we experienced dramatic price decreases in the commodities we produce. Through the third quarter of 2016, commodity prices have remained volatile, but improved compared to the first half of 2016; however, commodity prices have not recovered sufficiently to allow us to resume our long-term business strategy of growth.  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we produced 1,117 MBoe, or 12.1 MBoe/d.  We did not drill any horizontal wells and completed three horizontal wells. At September 30, 2016, we had four horizontal Wolfcamp wells waiting on completion.  We currently have one horizontal rig running in Project Pangea. 
   On November 2, 2016, we entered into an exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with the largest holder of our Senior Notes (the  Equitizing Noteholder ) to exchange $130,552,000 principal amount of our Senior Notes for 39,165,600 newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the  Exchange ). Accrued, unpaid interest on the Senior Notes held by the exchanging noteholder will be paid by the Company in cash at the closing of the Exchange. The Exchange is conditioned on  
 13 

stockholder approval. If the Exchange is approved by stockholders and closes, a second supplemental indenture will become effective, which will remove certain covenants and events of default from the Indenture governing our Senior Notes, and eliminate   certain restrictive covenants discussed in Note 3. We also have agreed, subject to stockholder approval   of an   increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock  ,   to offer to exchange our remaining   $  99,768,000     principal amount of outstanding Se  nior Notes into shares of our common stock on similar economic terms to the holders of the remaining Senior Notes (the  Follow-On Exchange ).  
 The Exchange, if approved and closed, and the Follow-On Exchange, if approved and closed, are expected to reduce our interest expense and our outstanding long-term debt. Additionally, utilization of our federal net operating loss carryforwards likely will be limited as a result of the Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange. We are unable to quantify an estimate of the possible limitation of the utilization of our federal net operating loss carryforwards. 
 2016 Capital Expenditures 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our capital expenditures totaled $5.5 million, consisting of $6.4 million for completion activities and $0.2 million for infrastructure projects and equipment, partially offset by a legal settlement with a service provider of $1.1 million.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our capital expenditures totaled $17.3 million, consisting of $15.8 million for drilling and completion activities and $2.6 million for infrastructure projects and equipment, partially offset by a legal settlement with a service provider of $1.1 million.  Our 2016 capital budget is a range of $20 million to $80 million. We have the operational flexibility to increase the lower end of the capital budget in case commodity prices recover further in 2016. 
 Our 2016 capital budget excludes acquisitions and lease extensions and renewals and is subject to change depending upon a number of factors, including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, NGLs and gas, results of horizontal drilling and completions, economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects, our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms. Although the impact of changes in these collective factors in a sustained, low commodity price environment is difficult to estimate, we currently expect to execute our development plan based on current conditions. To the extent there is a significant increase or decrease in commodity prices in the future, we will assess the impact on our development plan at that time, and we may respond to such changes by altering our capital budget or our development plan.

Results of Operations  
 The following table sets forth summary information regarding oil, NGL and gas revenues, production, average product prices and average production costs and expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  We determine a barrel of oil equivalent using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Boe, and one barrel of NGLs to one Boe. The ratios of six Mcf of natural gas to one Boe and one barrel of NGLs to one Boe do not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a Boe for natural gas or NGLs may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
 Oil, NGL and gas sales .  Oil, NGL and gas sales decreased $10.2 million, or 30%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, to $23.7 million, compared to $33.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in oil, NGL and gas sales was due to a decrease in average realized commodity prices ($1.1 million) and a decrease in production volumes ($9.1 million).  Production volumes decreased as a result of reduced drilling and completion activity.  
 Net loss .  Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $9.1 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $148.8 million, or $3.67 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, included a realized gain on commodity derivatives of $0.8 million and an unrealized gain on commodity derivatives of $0.8 million. The decrease in the net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to the impairment loss ($220.2 million) in the three months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by a decrease in the income tax benefit ($76.9 million).  
 Oil, NGL and gas production.   Production for the three months ended September 30, 2016, totaled 1,117 MBoe (12.1 MBoe/d), compared to production of 1,525 MBoe (16.6 MBoe/d) in the prior-year period, a 27% decrease.  Production for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was 27% oil, 35% NGLs and 38% gas, compared to 32% oil, 32% NGLs and 36% gas in the 2015 period.  Production volumes decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of reduced drilling and completion activity.  
 Commodity derivative activities.  Our commodity derivative activity resulted in a realized gain of $0.8 million and $12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $21.96 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $30.62 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives are derived from the relative movement of commodity prices in relation to the fixed notional pricing of our derivatives contracts for the respective periods.  The unrealized gain on commodity derivatives was $0.8 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As commodity prices increase or decrease, the fair value of the open portion of those positions decreases or increases, respectively.  
 Historically, we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash-flow hedges. We record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives. We record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled  unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives.

Lease operating.   Our lease operating expenses ( LOE ) decreased $  3.8   million, or   49  %, for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016, to $  3.9   million, or $  3.49     per Boe, compared to $  7.7   million, or $  5.04   per Boe, for the th  ree months ended   September   30  , 2015.  The   de  c  rease in LOE per Boe for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016, was due to increased efficiency in our water hauling operations,   lower pumpers and supervision costs due to a reduction in our workforce  ,   a dec  rease in compressor rental and repair   and   a   de  crease in well repairs, workovers and maintenance.   We expect LOE per Boe to increase   for the remainder of the year due to seasonal expenses and natural production decline  s  .     The following table summarizes LOE pe  r Boe.  

Production and ad valorem taxes.  Our production and ad valorem taxes decreased $0.7 million, or 25%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, to $2 million compared to $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in production and ad valorem taxes was primarily a function of the decrease in oil, NGL and gas sales between the two periods.  Production and ad valorem taxes were $1.80 per Boe and $1.77 per Boe and approximately 8.5% and 8% of oil, NGL and gas sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Exploration.  We recorded $1 million, or $0.94 per Boe, and $2 million, or $1.28 per Boe, of exploration expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease in exploration expense was primarily due to the early termination fee of a drilling contract in the three months ended September 30, 2015 of $1.7 million, partially offset by lease expirations in the current period.   
 General and administrative . Our general and administrative expenses ( G A ) decreased $1.5 million, or 20%, to $5.8 million, or $5.21 per Boe, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7.3 million, or $4.77 per Boe, for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in G A was primarily due to lower share-based compensation, salaries and benefits and other cost saving initiatives.  The following table summarizes G A in millions and G A per Boe.  

Impairment of oil and gas properties.  We did not recognize an impairment loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016. We recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $220.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to a decrease in our estimated future cash flows related to forward commodity prices. The impairment loss was primarily attributable to vertical Canyon wells in Ozona Northeast. Significant inputs used to assess proved property impairment include estimates of: (i) future sales prices for oil and gas based on NYMEX strip prices; (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials; (iii) production costs; (iv) capital expenditures; (v) future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof; and (vi) discount rate.   
 We may incur additional impairments to our oil and natural gas properties in the future if oil and gas prices continue to decline. The possibility and amount of any future impairment is difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon future oil and gas prices, estimates of proved reserves and future capital expenditures and production costs.  
   
 17 

Termination costs  .   We did not r  ecognize termination costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016.   We recorded $1.4 million in termination costs for the three months ended September 30, 2015, in connection with a reduction of our workforce.  
   
 Depletion, depreciation and amortization.   Our depletion, depreciation and amortization expense ( DD A ) decreased $11.8 million, or 38%, to $19.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $31.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Our DD A per Boe decreased by $3.09, or 15%, to $17.38 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $20.47 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in DD A expense over the prior-year period was primarily due to lower production.  The decrease in DD A per Boe over the prior-year period was primarily due to lower oil and gas property carrying costs relative to estimated proved developed reserves.  
 Interest expense, net.   Our interest expense, net, increased $0.6 million, or 9%, to $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was due to higher interest expense from increased borrowings and the applicable margin rates under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by interest savings of $0.3 million from our 2015 repurchase of $19.7 million aggregate face value of our 7% Senior Notes due 2021 ( Senior Notes ) on the open market.  We expect our interest expense to remain higher than the prior-year period as a result of a higher outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and an increase in the applicable margin rates under our revolving credit facility. If the Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange close, we expect our interest expense to decrease in 2017, due to the reduction in our outstanding long-term debt. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange.  
 Gain on extinguishment of debt.  We did not recognize a gain on debt extinguishment during the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased a portion of our Senior Notes in the open market with an aggregate face value of $5 million for a purchase price of $3.5 million, including accrued interest. This resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million.  
 Income taxes.  Our income tax benefit decreased $76.9 million to $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $81.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the income tax benefit was primarily due to the decrease in net loss before income taxes in the 2016 period.  Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was 35.1%, compared to 35.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
 Oil, NGL and gas sales .  Oil, NGL and gas sales decreased $42 million, or 40%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to $63.8 million, compared to $105.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in oil, NGL and gas sales was due to a decrease in average realized commodity prices ($22.6 million) and a decrease in production volumes ($19.4 million).  Production volumes decreased as a result of reduced drilling and completion activity.  
 Net loss .  Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $38.8 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to $168.3 million, or $4.16 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, included a realized gain on commodity derivatives of $5.7 million and an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $8.3 million. The decrease in the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to the impairment loss ($220.2 million) in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, lower revenues ($42 million) due to depressed commodity prices and lower production, partially offset by a decrease in the income tax benefit ($72.3 million).  
 Oil, NGL and gas production.   Production for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, totaled 3,431 MBoe (12.5 MBoe/d), compared to production of 4,202 MBoe (15.4 MBoe/d) in the prior-year period, an 18% decrease.  Production for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was 28% oil, 34% NGLs and 38% gas, compared to 35% oil, 30% NGLs and 35% gas in the 2015 period.  Production volumes decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of reduced drilling and completion activity.  
 Commodity derivative activities.  Our commodity derivative activity resulted in a realized gain of $5.7 million and $37.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our average realized price, including the effect of commodity derivatives, was $20.25 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $34.22 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives are derived from the relative movement of commodity prices in relation to the fixed notional pricing of our derivatives contracts for the respective periods.  The unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was $8.3 million and $22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  As commodity prices increase or decrease, the fair value of the open portion of those positions decreases or increases, respectively.

Lease operating.   Our LOE decreased $  6.2   million, or   29  %, for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, to $  15.5   million, or $  4.51   per Boe, compared to $  21.7   million, or $  5.  17   per Boe, for the   nine   months ended   S  eptember   30, 2015.  The   de  crease in LOE per Boe for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016, was primarily due to increased efficiency in our water hauling operations,   lower pumpers and supervision costs due to a reduction in our workforce   and     a decrease   in compressor rental and repair, partially offset by an increase in well repairs, workovers and maintenance. The following table summarizes LOE per Boe.  

Production and ad valorem taxes.  Our production and ad valorem taxes decreased $3 million, or 35%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to $5.5 million compared to $8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in production and ad valorem taxes was primarily a function of the decrease in oil, NGL and gas sales between the two periods.  Production and ad valorem taxes were $1.61 per Boe and $2.02 per Boe and approximately 8.7% and 8% of oil, NGL and gas sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
 Exploration.  We recorded $3.2 million, or $0.94 per Boe, and $4.2 million, or $1.00 per Boe, of exploration expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The decrease in exploration expense was primarily due to the early termination fee of a drilling contract in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 for $2.2 million, partially offset by lease expirations, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
 General and administrative . Our G A decreased $5.2 million, or 23%, to $17.7 million, or $5.16 per Boe, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $22.9 million, or $5.45 per Boe, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in G A was primarily due to lower salaries and benefits, share-based compensation and other cost saving initiatives.  The following table summarizes G A in millions and G A per Boe.  

Impairment of oil and gas properties.  We did not recognize an impairment loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $220.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due primarily to a decrease in our estimated future cash flows related to forward commodity prices. The impairment loss was primarily attributable to vertical Canyon wells in Ozona Northeast. Significant inputs used to assess proved property impairment include estimates of: (i) future sales prices for oil and gas based on NYMEX strip prices; (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials; (iii) production costs; (iv) capital expenditures; (v) future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof; and (vi) discount rate.   
 We may incur additional impairments to our oil and natural gas properties in the future if oil and gas prices continue to decline. The possibility and amount of any future impairment is difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon future oil and gas prices, estimates of proved reserves and future capital expenditures and production costs.  
   
 19 

Termination costs.   We did not recognize termination costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.   We recorded $1.4 million   in termination costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, in connection with a reduction of our workforce.  
   
 Depletion, depreciation and amortization.   Our DD A decreased $26.5 million, or 31%, to $59.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $86.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Our DD A per Boe decreased by $3.12, or 15%, to $17.38 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $20.50 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in DD A expense over the prior-year period was primarily due to lower production.  The decrease in DD A per Boe over the prior-year period was primarily due to lower oil and gas property carrying costs relative to estimated proved developed reserves.  
 Interest expense, net.    Our interest expense, net, increased $1.6 million, or 8%, to $20.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $18.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase was due to higher interest expense from increased borrowings and the applicable margin rates under our revolving credit facility, partially offset by interest savings of $1 million from our 2015 repurchase of $19.7 million aggregate face value of our Senior Notes on the open market.  We expect our interest expense to remain higher than the prior-year period as a result of a higher outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and an increase in the applicable margin rates under our revolving credit facility. If the Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange close, we expect our interest expense to decrease in 2017, due to the reduction in our outstanding long-term debt. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange.  
 Gain on extinguishment of debt.  We did not recognize a gain on debt extinguishment during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repurchased a portion of our Senior Notes in the open market with an aggregate face value of $5 million for a purchase price of $3.5 million, including accrued interest. This resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million.  
 Write-off of debt issuance costs.  We recorded a $0.6 million write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, related to the third amendment of our revolving credit facility, due to the reduction in our borrowing base from $450 million to $325 million.   
 Other income.  We recorded other income of $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was primarily due to a contractual settlement of $1.4 million.  
 Income taxes.  Our income tax benefit decreased $72.3 million to $20.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $93.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the income tax benefit was primarily due to the decrease in net loss before income taxes in the 2016 period.  Our effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was 35%, compared to 35.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generally will rely on cash generated from operations, borrowings, to the extent available, under our revolving credit facility and, to the extent that credit and capital market conditions will allow, future public or private equity and debt offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs.   Our primary cash requirements have included G A, LOE, capital expenditures, short-term working capital needs and interest payments on our outstanding debt.  Our ability to fund our cash requirements, including planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions, depends upon our future operating performance, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and more broadly, on the availability of equity and debt financing, which is affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.  We cannot predict whether additional liquidity from equity or debt financings beyond our revolving credit facility will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, in the foreseeable future. 
 Our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices, production volumes and the effect of commodity derivatives. Cash flows from operations are primarily used to fund exploration and development of our oil and gas properties. If commodity prices remain at their current depressed levels or decline further, our operating cash flows will decrease and our lenders may further reduce our borrowing base, thus limiting the amounts available to fund future capital expenditures. If we are unable to replace our oil, NGL and gas reserves through acquisition, development and exploration, we may also suffer a reduction in operating cash flows and access to funds under our revolving credit facility.   
   We believe we presently have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current development project.  However, we may determine to use various financing sources, including the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, debt, convertible securities and other securities for future development of reserves, acquisitions, additional working capital or other liquidity needs, if such financing  
 20 

is   available on acceptable terms.  We cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.  Using some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our revolving credit facility.  
   
 In addition, we have explored, and have discussed with select parties, including select holders of our securities, various alternatives to strengthen our balance sheet, and preserve financial flexibility. These alternatives have included additional debt buybacks, debt-for-debt or debt-for-equity exchanges or refinancings, strategic investments and joint ventures, sales of assets or working interests, and private or public equity raises and rights offerings. On November 2, 2016, we entered into an Exchange Agreement with the Equitizing Noteholder of our Senior Notes to exchange $130,552,000 principal amount of our Senior Notes for 39,165,600 newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share.  Accrued, unpaid interest on the Senior Notes held by the exchanging noteholder will be paid in cash by the Company at the closing of the Exchange. The Exchange is conditioned on stockholder approval. We also have agreed, subject to stockholder approval, to offer to exchange our remaining $99,768,000 principal amount of outstanding Senior Notes for shares of our common stock on similar economic terms to the holders of the remaining Senior Notes. The Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange, if approved and closed, are expected to improve our liquidity and operating cash flow through the reduction of interest expense related to the Senior Notes. Following the close of the Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange, we may resume these discussions to further pursue other transactions. 
 Liquidity 
 We define liquidity as funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents.  At September 30, 2016, we had $275 million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and liquidity of $52.4 million, compared to $273 million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and liquidity of $177.3 million at December 31, 2015. The table below summarizes our liquidity position at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands). 

Working Capital 
 Our working capital is affected primarily by our cash and cash equivalents balance and our capital spending program.  We had a working capital deficit of $13.4 million at September 30, 2016, compared to a working capital deficit of $8.1 million at December 31, 2015.  The change in working capital was due to the timing of settlement of current assets and liabilities, and the change in fair value of outstanding commodity derivative positions for the three months ended September 30, 2016. To the extent we operate, or end fiscal year 2016, with a working capital deficit, we expect such deficit to be offset by liquidity available under our revolving credit facility. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds for the periods noted (in thousands). 

Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by 76%, or $62.7 million, to $19.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in our cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in oil, NGL and gas sales from lower commodity prices and lower production.  
 21 

Investing Activities  
 Cash used in investing activities decreased by $188.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to $18.8 million, compared to the prior-year period. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily attributable to drilling and development ($15.8 million) and infrastructure projects and equipment ($2.6 million), partially offset by a legal settlement with a service provider ($1.1 million).  Cash used in investing activities included changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($1.5 million).  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we drilled a total of four and completed five horizontal wells. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities decreased by $123.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to $1.1 million, compared to the prior-year period. We had $275 million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at September 30, 2016, compared to $278 million in outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities included borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $40.6 million that were partially offset by repayments of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $38.6 million. 
   
 We have discussed with select parties transactions to recapitalize, refinance or otherwise restructure our capital structure. We have considered potentially accomplishing this through a variety of methods, including privately negotiated transactions, which may include, among other things, debt-for-debt or debt-for-equity exchanges or refinancings, repurchases of our outstanding debt, and private or public equity raises and rights offerings. As a result of this process, on November 2, 2016, we entered into a debt-for-equity exchange agreement with the Equitizing Noteholder that is further described in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Following the close of the Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange, we may resume these discussions to further pursue other transactions. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 At September 30, 2016, the borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments under our revolving credit facility were $325 million, with maximum commitments from the lenders of $1 billion and a maturity date of May 7, 2019.  We had outstanding borrowings of $275 million and $273 million under our revolving credit facility at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was 3.8%.  
 In order to provide more flexibility in managing our balance sheet, we entered into a third amendment to our revolving credit facility on May 3, 2016.  Specifically, the third amendment modified our interest coverage ratio covenant (as defined in the revolving credit facility) to 1.25 to 1.0  (or 1.0 to 1.0 following the issuance of second lien indebtedness),  through December 31, 2017, 1.5 to 1.0 through December 31, 2018, and 2.0 to 1.0 thereafter (from previous ratio of 2.5 to 1.0).  Additionally, the third amendment  (a) decreased the borrowing base to  $325  million from $450 million, (b) increased the applicable margin rates on borrowings by 100 basis points, (c) permits the Company to issue up to $150 million of second lien indebtedness, subject to various conditions and limitations, and (d) permits the Company to repurchase outstanding debt with proceeds of certain asset sales, equity issuances or second lien indebtedness.  Additional information regarding our credit arrangements is included in Note 3.  Long-Term Debt.  
 The borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is redetermined semi-annually based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserve levels. In addition to such semi-annual redeterminations, our lenders may request one additional redetermination during any 12-month period. We expect to maintain adequate liquidity to fund our operations after our borrowing base redetermination in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our semi-annual borrowing base redetermination process is underway, but not yet final. There is no assurance that the borrowing base will not be higher or lower than our $325 million borrowing base as of September 30, 2016. 
 At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants, and there were no existing defaults or events of default under our debt instruments. To date, we have experienced no disruptions in our ability to access our revolving credit facility.  However, our lenders have substantial ability to reduce our borrowing base on the basis of subjective factors, including the loan collateral value that each lender, in its discretion and using the methodology, assumptions and discount rates as such lender customarily uses in evaluating oil and gas properties, assigns to our properties.  
 Contractual Obligations 
   Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating lease obligations, asset retirement obligations and employment agreements with our executive officers. At September 30, 2016, outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $275  
 22 

million, compared to $273 million at December 31, 2015. Since December 31, 2015, there have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations.  
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 From time to time, we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off-balance sheet obligations. As of September 30, 2016, the off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include undrawn letters of credit and operating lease agreements. We do not believe that these arrangements have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 General Trends and Outlook 
   
 Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of oil, NGLs and gas.  Through the third quarter of 2016, commodity prices have remained volatile  but improved as compared to the first half of 2016.  However, commodity prices have not recovered sufficiently to allow us to resume our long-term business strategy of growth. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market demand, which is impacted by domestic and foreign supply of oil, NGL and gas, overall domestic and global economic conditions, commodity processing, gathering and transportation availability and the availability of refining capacity, price and availability of alternative fuels, price and quantity of foreign imports, domestic and foreign governmental regulations, political conditions in or affecting other oil and gas producing countries, weather and technological advances affecting oil, NGL and gas consumption.  As a result, we cannot accurately predict future oil, NGL and gas prices, and therefore, we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes and future revenues.  A substantial or extended decline, or a lack of recovery, in oil, NGL and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and liquidity that may be accessed through our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and through capital markets. 
 In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. Future finding and development costs are subject to changes in the industry, including the costs of acquiring, drilling and completing our projects.  We focus our efforts on increasing oil and gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long-term operations. Our future cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to manage our overall cost structure. 
 Like all oil and gas production companies, we face the challenge of natural production declines. Oil and gas production from a given well naturally decreases over time. Additionally, our production has a rapid initial decline, followed by a long period of shallower decline. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to develop and identify additional reserves, farm-ins or other joint drilling ventures, and by acquisitions. However, during times of severe price declines, such as the current one, we may from time to time reduce current capital expenditures and curtail drilling operations further in order to preserve liquidity.  A material reduction in capital expenditures and drilling activities could materially reduce our production volumes and revenues. 
 We also face the challenge of financing exploration, development and future acquisitions. We believe we presently have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and execution of our current, reduced development plan.  See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion related to the Exchange Agreement we entered into on November 2, 2016, which, if completed, we expect to increase our liquidity and operating cash flow due to the reduction of interest expense.  In addition, we may determine to use various financing sources, including the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, debt, convertible securities and other securities for future development of reserves, acquisitions, additional working capital or other liquidity needs, if such financing is available on acceptable terms.  We cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.  Using some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our revolving credit facility. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Some of the information below contains forward-looking statements. The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term  market risk  refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices, and other related factors. The disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses, but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. Our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for commodity derivative and investment purposes, not for trading purposes. 
 23 

Commodity Price Risk  
 Given the current economic outlook, we expect commodity prices to remain volatile.  Even modest decreases in commodity prices can materially affect our revenues and cash flow.  In addition, if commodity prices remain low for a significant amount of time, we could be required under successful efforts accounting rules to write down our oil and gas properties. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2016, the NYMEX WTI prompt month price ranged from a low of $39.51 per barrel to $48.99 per barrel. In the three months ended September 30, 2015, the NYMEX WTI prompt month price ranged from a low of $38.24 per barrel to $56.96 per barrel. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2016, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prompt month price ranged from a low of $2.55 per MMBtu to $3.06 per MMBtu. In the three months ended September 30, 2015, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prompt month price ranged from a low of $2.52 per MMBtu to $2.93 per MMBtu. 
 We enter into financial swaps and options to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations.  We do not designate such instruments as cash flow hedges.  Accordingly, we record open commodity derivative positions on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and recognize changes in such fair values as income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations as they occur. 
 The following table provides our outstanding commodity derivative positions at September 30, 2016. 

After September 30, 2016, we entered into natural gas collars covering 100,000 MMBtu per month with a floor price of $3.00/MMBtu and a ceiling price of $3.65/MMBtu for January 2017 through December 2017, and natural gas collars covering 400,000 MMBtu per month with a floor price of $3.00/MMBtu and a ceiling price of $3.47/MMBtu for April 2017 through December 2017. 
   
  At September 30, 2016, the fair value of our open derivative contracts was a net liability of $1.5 million, compared to an asset of $6.7 million at December 31, 2015. 
 We are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our commodity derivative positions. We do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions; however, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future.  All of the counterparties to our commodity derivative positions are participants in our revolving credit facility, and the collateral for the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility is used as collateral for our commodity derivatives. 
 Unrealized gains and losses, at fair value, are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non-current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts.  Changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations.  We estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange-quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities.  We internally valued the option contracts using industry-standard option pricing models and observable market inputs.  We use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.  Realized gains and losses are also included in income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. 
   For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $8.3 million and $22.9 million, respectively, from the change in fair value of our commodity derivatives positions.  A hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a $2 million decrease in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions  
 24 

recorded on our balance sheet at   September   30  , 2016, and a corresponding increase in the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives recorded on our consolidated statement of oper  ations for the three months ended   September   30  , 2016.  
     Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Such controls include those designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President ( CEO ), and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in that they ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations Inherent in All Controls 
 Our management, including the CEO and CFO, recognizes that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls (discussed above) cannot prevent all errors or all attempts at fraud. Any controls system, no matter how well-crafted and operated, can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, no evaluation or implementation of a control system can provide complete assurance that all control issues and all possible instances of fraud have been or will be detected.  

25 

PART II O    THER   INFORMATION  
     Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 There have been no material developments in the legal proceedings described in Part I, Item 3.  Legal Proceedings  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016. 
     Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in the following report that we have filed with the SEC, which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations: Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, under the headings Item 1.  Business   Markets and Customers; Competition; and Regulation,  Item 1A.  Risk Factors,  Item 7.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   General Trends and Outlook  and Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016. 
  Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016, which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov and our website at www.approachresources.com.  
   
 If the Exchange and the Follow-On Exchange (together, the  Transactions ) are not approved by stockholders, or if they are approved but not successful, we may seek alternative recapitalization transactions, which may place stockholders at significant risk of  incurring more dilution than would occur under the Transactions, or losing some or all of their interests in the Company. 
   
 We have been actively engaged in the process of analyzing various options to address our liquidity as well as assessing our overall capital structure.  If the Transactions are not approved by stockholders, or if they are approved but not successfully completed, we may determine to evaluate alternative transactions that would reduce leverage and increase liquidity and operating cash flow. These alternative transactions may not be as advantageous to the existing holders of our common stock as the Transactions. Some of these alternatives may include additional debt buybacks, debt-for-debt or debt-for-equity exchanges or refinancings, strategic investments and joint ventures, sales of assets or working interests, private or public equity raises or rights offerings or other restructuring plans or transactions which may have a more dilutive effect on our existing stockholders than the contemplated Transactions. 
   
 Our revolving credit facility borrowing base is subject to semi-annual redetermination, and current Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) guidelines may incent lenders to limit our borrowing capabilities. 
   
 In March 2016, the OCC issued revised guidelines for exploration and production companies that specify target leverage metrics that we currently exceed.  The lower a loan s credit rating, the more reserves a bank must set aside. This makes it more expensive for the bank to keep a negatively-rated, or classified, loan on its books.  A failure to complete the Transactions would result in our continuing with leverage significantly in excess of OCC guidelines, which would increase our risk of a negative semi-annual borrowing base redetermination, which could in turn materially decrease our liquidity or cause our borrowings to exceed our borrowing base and cause us to be in default under our credit agreement. 
   
 The issuances of our common stock in connection with the Transactions would cause substantial dilution, which could materially affect the trading price of our Common Stock. 
   
 If the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable is issued in connection with the Transactions, such shares would represent approximately 62.4% of our outstanding shares.  Such issuances could result in substantial decreases to our stock price.  In addition, subject to the terms of a Stockholders Agreement to be entered into between the Equitizing Noteholder and the Company (the  Stockholders Agreement ), our existing stockholders may have reduced input on matters for which a stockholder vote is requested or required. 
   
 The closing of the Exchange will concentrate significant voting power in the hands of one stockholder. 
   
 Upon closing of the Exchange, the Equitizing Noteholder will become the Company s largest individual stockholder.  Even assuming full participation in the Follow-On Exchange, the Equitizing Noteholder will continue to be the Company s largest individual stockholder.  Subject to the restrictions set forth in the Stockholders Agreement, the Equitizing Noteholder may have significant input on matters for which a stockholder vote is requested or required. 
   
 26 

The Transactions may not   be completed   on the expected timeline  ,   or at all. The failure to complete the Transactions could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and otherwise have an adverse impact on us.  
   
 The Transactions are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including stockholder approval of the Exchange, and the Follow-On Exchange.  Even if the Exchange is completed, the Follow-On Exchange may be delayed and, even if commenced, may not be completed or successful. Further, a failed transaction may result in negative publicity or a negative impression of us in the investment community and may affect our relationship with employees, vendors, creditors and other business partners. Accordingly, if the Transactions are not completed, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected. 
   Item 2.   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 The following table provides information relating to our purchase of shares of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The repurchases reflect shares withheld upon vesting of restricted stock under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan to satisfy statutory minimum tax withholding obligations.
