  Note 1   Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Matrix Service Company ( Matrix ,  we ,  our ,  us ,  its  or the  Company ) and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X for interim financial statements required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not include all information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  The information furnished reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described herein, that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, cash flows and financial position for the interim periods presented.  The accompanying condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended   June 30, 2016  , included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year then ended.  The results of operations for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for the full year ending   June 30, 2017  . 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 
  On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09.  The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  The core principle of the revenue model is that  an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.   The ASU also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enables users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The ASU's disclosure requirements are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards.  The ASU applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). 
  The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted on a limited basis.  Upon adoption, the Company may elect one of two application methods, a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application.  We expect to adopt this standard on July 1, 2018 and are currently evaluating its expected impact on our financial statements. 
  Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    
  On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements.  The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements.  Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is  substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.   The FASB believes that requiring management to perform the assessment will enhance the timeliness, clarity, and consistency of related disclosures and improve convergence with international financial reporting standards ("IFRSs") (which emphasize management s responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment).  However, the time horizon for the assessment (look-forward period) and the disclosure thresholds under U.S. GAAP and IFRSs will continue to differ.  The ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter; early adoption is permitted. 
  The ASU was adopted during the Company's first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016.  In connection with the adoption of the ASU, the Company now performs an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern on a quarterly basis.  Disclosure regarding the status of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is required when there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.

Accounting Standards Update 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments    
  On September 25, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments.  The ASU was issued in response to stakeholder feedback that restatements of prior periods to reflect adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination increase the cost and complexity of financial reporting but do not significantly improve the usefulness of the information.  Under the ASU, an acquirer must recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The ASU also requires acquirers to present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We adopted this standard on July 1, 2016 with no material impact to the Company's financial statements. 
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02. The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the ASU's expected impact on our financial statements. 
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which simplified several aspects of accounting for stock-based compensation transactions, including the accounting for income taxes and forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements.  The ASU is effective for the Company on July 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company adopted the ASU during its first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016.  The following is a description of the key provisions of the ASU and their impacts to the Company's financial statements: 
  Accounting for Income Taxes  : The amendments require the Company to recognize excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies in its provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of income during the period of vesting or exercise of its nonvested deferred share awards and stock options, respectively, for which it expects to receive an income tax deduction.  Previously, the Company recognized any excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital ("APIC") in the balance sheet and any tax deficiencies were recognized as a reduction of APIC to the extent the Company has accumulated excess tax benefits.  Any tax deficiencies in excess of accumulated excess tax benefits in APIC were recognized in the provision for income taxes.  The amendments also require the Company to only present excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the operating section of its statements of cash flows as a component of deferred tax activity.  Previously, the Company was required to present such items in both the financing section and operating section of its statements of cash flows.  Amendments related to the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income are required to be applied prospectively, and amendments related to the cash flow statement presentation of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies may be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. 
  The Company applied the amendments requiring the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income prospectively.  As a result, the Company recognized   $0.4 million   of excess tax benefits in its provision for income taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which increased basic and diluted earnings per share by   $0.01  .  Under the prior accounting standard, the Company would have recognized the excess tax benefits in equity as additional paid-in capital.    The amendments relating to the presentation of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the statement of cash flows were applied retrospectively.  The effect of the retrospective adjustment was to eliminate the presentation of an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow for excess tax benefits on exercised stock options and vesting of deferred shares.  These eliminations reduced both net cash used by operating activities and net cash provided by financing activities by less than $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net cash flows did not change as a result of the retrospective adjustment.

Accounting for Forfeitures  :  The amendments in this ASU allow the Company to elect, as a company-wide accounting policy, either to continue to estimate the amount of forfeitures to exclude from compensation expense or to exclude forfeitures from compensation expense as they occur.  Upon the adoption of the ASU during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.  The Company is required to apply these amendments on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year.  The Company recorded a modified retrospective adjustment to reduce the June 30, 2016 retained earnings balance and increase the additional paid-in capital balance by $0.1 million each. 
  Statutory Tax Withholding Requirements  : Under the prior accounting standard, an entire award must be classified as a liability if the fair value of the shares withheld exceeds the Company's minimum statutory withholding obligation.  Under the ASU, the Company is allowed to withhold shares with a fair value up to the amount of tax owed using the maximum statutory tax rate in the employee's applicable jurisdictions.  The Company is allowed to determine one maximum rate for all employees in each jurisdiction, rather than a rate for each employee in the jurisdiction.  Also, the ASU requires that cash outflows to reacquire shares withheld for taxes to be classified in the financing section of the statement of cash flows.   
  The Company adopted the ASU during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  Since the Company did not have any awards classified as liabilities due to statutory tax withholding requirements as of September 30, 2016, and since the Company already presented its cash outflows for reacquiring shares withheld for taxes as a financing activity in its statements of cash flows, these amendments did not have any impact on its financial statements upon adoption.  The Company does not expect changes to employee withholdings  for stock compensation to have a material impact to the financial statements. 
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which changes how the Company accounts for its allowance for uncollectible accounts.  The amendments in this update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.  The income statement will reflect any increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period.  The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount.  
  Current GAAP delays the recognition of the full amount of credit losses until the loss is probable of occurring.  The amendments in this update eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold and, instead, reflect the Company's current estimate of all expected credit losses.  In addition, current guidance limits the information the Company may consider in measuring a credit loss to its past events and current conditions.  The amendments in this update broaden the information the Company may consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate to include forecasted information.  
  The amendments in this update are effective for the Company on July 1, 2020 and the Company may early adopt on July 1, 2019.  The Company must apply the amendments in this update through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.  At this time, the Company does not expect this update to have a material impact to its estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts.

Note 2   Acquisition 
  Purchase of Baillie Tank Equipment, Ltd. 
  On   February 1, 2016  , the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding stock of   Baillie Tank Equipment, Ltd. ( BTE )  , an internationally-based company with nearly 20 years of experience in the design and manufacture of products for use on aboveground storage tanks.  Founded in 1998, BTE is a provider of tank products including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems, and seals.  BTE is headquartered in Sydney, Australia with a manufacturing facility in Seoul, South Korea.  The Company acquired BTE to expand its service offerings of certain technical solutions for aboveground storage tanks.  The business is now known as Matrix Applied Technologies, and its operating results are included in the Storage Solutions segment. 
  The Company purchased BTE with cash on-hand for a net purchase price of   $13.0 million  .  The Company paid   $15.4 million   when including the subsequent repayment of long-term debt acquired and the settlement of certain other liabilities acquired, and excluding the cash acquired and certain amounts owed to the former owners for working capital adjustments.  The net purchase price was allocated to the major categories of assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair value at the acquisition date.   
  The following table summarizes the preliminary net purchase price allocation (in thousands):   

  The goodwill recognized from the acquisition is attributable to the synergies of combining our operations and the technical expertise of the acquired workforce.  None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes.  The fair value of the net assets acquired is preliminary pending the final valuation of those assets.  As a result, goodwill is also preliminary since it has been recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. 
  The Company incurred   $0.8 million   of expenses related to the acquisition during fiscal 2016, which were included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.  The acquired business contributed revenues of   $1.0 million   and an operating loss of   $0.4 million   during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
  Note 3   Uncompleted Contracts 
  Contract terms of the Company s construction contracts generally provide for progress billings based on project milestones.  The excess of costs incurred and estimated earnings over amounts billed on uncompleted contracts is reported as a current asset.  The excess of amounts billed over costs incurred and estimated earnings recognized on uncompleted contracts is reported as a current liability.  Gross and net amounts on uncompleted contracts are as follows:

Progress billings in accounts receivable at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   included retentions to be collected within one year of   $43.2 million   and   $29.7 million  , respectively.  Contract retentions collectible beyond one year are included in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet and totaled   $0.3 million   at   June 30, 2016  .  There were no retentions collectible beyond one year at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Other 
  Under percentage of completion accounting for fixed-priced contracts, contract revenues and earnings are recognized ratably over the contract term based on the proportion of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company is performing work on two previously announced significant multi-year projects that are contracted on a fixed price basis.  One of the projects is expected to be complete in fiscal 2017 and the second project is expected to be complete in fiscal 2018.   
  On the project that is expected to complete in fiscal 2018, which is a contract for the construction of a power generating station, the Company recorded a project charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  The charge primarily related to costs incurred that relate to a pending claim for which the Company did not recognize any profit and changes in estimated costs on certain portions of the work.  The Company is in active negotiations with the client regarding the recovery of claim related costs and extension of the project completion date.  These costs primarily relate to owner provided engineering and equipment, which has resulted in additional work and a delayed project completion date.  The outcome of these negotiations is unpredictable and may have a significant financial impact to the Company. 
  Although there is significant uncertainty surrounding the client negotiations on the power generation project, based on the information currently available, the Company believes that its current estimates relating to these projects are reasonable.  However, it is possible that changes to these contract estimates, including those related to project costs, project timelines, and change orders or claims, could occur and have a material positive or negative impact to our results of operations and financial position in subsequent accounting periods.

Note 4   Intangible Assets Including Goodwill 
  Goodwill                                                                                   
  The changes in the carrying value of goodwill by segment are as follows: 

(1) 
    The translation adjustments relate to the periodic translation of Canadian Dollar and South Korean Won denominated goodwill recorded as a part of prior acquisitions in Canada and South Korea, in which the local currency was determined to be the functional currency. 
     The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of May 31, 2016, which did not indicate the existence of any impairment at that time.  While the operating results for the Oil Gas   Chemical and Industrial segments indicated a loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company does not consider these results to be a triggering event requiring the performance of an interim goodwill impairment test since the Company has not significantly changed its forecasts since the annual test was performed and the Company continues to consider these segments as core to its business and believes future performance will improve.  The Company will continue to monitor its operating results for indicators of impairment and perform additional tests as necessary.

    We are required to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, greater than or equal to   1.25   to   1.00  , determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter. 
                
    Asset dispositions (other than inventory and obsolete or unneeded equipment disposed of in the ordinary course of business) are limited to   $20.0 million   per 12-month period. 
     Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR or an Alternate Base Rate, plus in each case, an additional margin based on the Senior Leverage Ratio.  The additional margin on Alternate Base Rate and LIBOR-based loans ranges between   0.25%   and   1.0%   and between   1.25%   and   2.0%  , respectively. 
  The Credit Agreement also permits us to borrow in Canadian dollars with a sub-limit of U.S.   $40.0 million  .  Amounts borrowed in Canadian dollars will bear interest either at the CDOR Rate, plus an additional margin based on the Senior Leverage Ratio ranging from   1.25%   to   2.0%  , or at the Canadian Prime Rate, plus an additional margin based on the Senior Leverage Ratio ranging from   1.75%   to   2.5%  .  The CDOR Rate is equal to the    sum of the annual rate of interest, which is the rate determined as being the arithmetic average of the quotations of all institutions listed in respect of the relevant CDOR interest period for Canadian Dollar denominated bankers  acceptances, plus 0.1%  .  The Canadian Prime Rate is equal to the   greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum most recently announced or established by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch as its reference rate in effect on such

day for determining interest rates for Canadian Dollar denominated commercial loans in Canada and (ii) the CDOR Rate plus 1.0%.    
  The Unused Credit Facility Fee is between   0.20%   and   0.35%   based on the Senior Leverage Ratio.    
  The Credit Agreement includes a Senior Leverage Ratio covenant,  which provides that Consolidated Funded Indebtedness, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, may not exceed   2.5   times Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, over the previous four quarters.  For the four quarters ended   September 30, 2016  , Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, was   $70.2 million  .  Accordingly, at   September 30, 2016  , there was a restriction on our ability to access the full amount of the credit facility.  Consolidated Funded Indebtedness at   September 30, 2016   was   $30.1 million  . 
  Availability under the senior revolving credit facility was as follows:    

Outstanding borrowings at   September 30, 2016   under our Credit Agreement were primarily used to fund working capital needs in our Canadian business due to the timing of collections and disbursements on the previously announced power generating project. 
  The Company is in compliance with all affirmative, negative, and financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
   
  Note 6   Income Taxes 
  We use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  Valuation allowances based on our judgments and estimates are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future operating results.  Company management believes that realization of deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance is more likely than not.  Our estimates are based on facts and circumstances in existence as well as interpretations of existing tax regulations and laws applied to the facts and circumstances. 
  The Company provides for income taxes regardless of whether it has received a tax assessment.  Taxes are provided when it is considered probable that additional taxes will be due in excess of amounts included in the tax return.  The Company regularly reviews exposure to additional income taxes due, and as further information is known or events occur, adjustments may be recorded. 
  Our effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   33.6%   compared to   34.3%   in the same period a year earlier.  The Company recorded discrete benefits of   $0.3 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and recorded   $0.5 million   of discrete benefits during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The fiscal 2017 discrete benefits primarily relate to the application of ASU 2016-09 (See Note 1) and the fiscal 2016 tax rate was positively impacted by a discrete item related to our Canadian operations. 
   
  Note 7   Commitments and Contingencies 
  Insurance Reserves 
  The Company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its operations.  However, exposure to potential losses is retained through the use of deductibles, self-insured retentions and coverage limits.

Typically our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide warranties for materials and workmanship.  The Company may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies or surety bonds for specific customers or provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects.  Matrix maintains a performance and payment bonding line sufficient to support the business.  The Company generally requires its subcontractors to indemnify the Company and the Company s customer and name the Company as an additional insured for activities arising out of the subcontractors  work.  We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of the Company, to secure the subcontractors  work or as required by the subcontract. 
  There can be no assurance that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers. 
  Unapproved Change Orders and Claims 
  Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues for unapproved change orders and claims of   $26.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $10.3 million   at   June 30, 2016  .  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recognized   $5.8 million   of unapproved change orders and a   $11.4 million   claim in connection with its ongoing work on a gas fired generating facility being constructed in Canada.  Generally, collection of amounts related to unapproved change orders and claims is expected within twelve months.  However, since customers may not pay these amounts until final resolution of related claims, collection of these amounts may extend beyond one year.

Note 9   Segment Information 
  We operate our business through four reportable segments: Electrical Infrastructure, Oil Gas   Chemical, Storage Solutions, and Industrial.  
  The Electrical Infrastructure segment primarily encompasses construction and maintenance services to a variety of power generation facilities, such as combined cycle plants, natural gas fired power stations, and renewable energy installations.  We also provide high voltage services to investor owned utilities, including construction of new substations, upgrades of existing substations, short-run transmission line installations, distribution upgrades and maintenance, and storm restoration services.  
  The Oil Gas   Chemical segment includes turnaround activities, plant maintenance services and construction in the downstream petroleum industry.  Another key offering is industrial cleaning services, which include hydroblasting, hydroexcavating, chemical cleaning and vacuum services.  We also perform work in the petrochemical, natural gas, gas processing and compression, and upstream petroleum markets.  
  The Storage Solutions segment includes new construction of crude and refined products aboveground storage tanks ( ASTs ), as well as planned and emergency maintenance services.  The Storage Solutions segment also includes balance of plant work in storage terminals and tank farms.  Also included in the Storage Solutions segment is work related to specialty storage tanks, including liquefied natural gas ( LNG ), liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen ( LIN/LOX ), liquid petroleum ( LPG ) tanks and other specialty vessels, including spheres.  Finally, we offer AST products, including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems and floating roof seals.  
  The Industrial segment includes construction and maintenance work in the iron and steel and mining and minerals industries.  Our work in the mining and minerals industry is primarily for customers engaged in the extraction of copper.  We also perform work in bulk material handling and fertilizer production facilities, thermal vacuum chambers, and other industrial markets. 
  The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on operating income.  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies footnote included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   June 30, 2016  .  Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at cost; therefore, no intersegment profit or loss is recognized.  
  Segment assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies from those reported in our fiscal   2016   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.  For more information on our critical accounting policies, see Part II, Item 7 of our fiscal   2016   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The following section provides certain information with respect to our critical accounting estimates as of the close of our most recent quarterly period. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Under percentage of completion accounting for fixed-priced contracts, contract revenues and earnings are recognized ratably over the contract term based on the proportion of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company is performing work on two previously announced significant multi-year projects that are contracted on a fixed price basis.  One of the projects is expected to be complete in fiscal 2017 and the second project is expected to be complete in fiscal 2018.   
  On the project that is expected to complete in fiscal 2018, which is a contract for the construction of a power generating station, the Company recorded a project charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  The charge primarily related to costs incurred that relate to a pending claim for which the Company did not recognize any profit and changes in estimated costs on certain portions of the work.  The Company is in active negotiations with the client regarding the recovery of claim related costs and extension of the project completion date.  These costs primarily relate to owner provided engineering and equipment, which has resulted in additional work and a delayed project completion date.  The outcome of these negotiations is unpredictable and may have a significant financial impact to the Company. 
  Although there is significant uncertainty surrounding the client negotiations on the power generation project, based on the information currently available, the Company believes that its current estimates relating to these projects are reasonable.  However, it is possible that changes to these contract estimates, including those related to project costs, project timelines, and change orders or claims, could occur and have a material positive or negative impact to our results of operations and financial position in subsequent accounting periods. 
  Goodwill 
  We performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to determine whether an impairment existed and to determine the amount of headroom.  We define "headroom" as the percentage difference between the fair value of a reporting unit and its carrying value.  The amount of headroom varies by reporting unit.  Approximately 54% of our goodwill balance was attributable to one reporting unit.  This unit had headroom of 158%.  The remaining goodwill was attributable to six reporting units, with headroom of between 17% and 488%.  Our significant assumptions, including revenue growth rates, gross margins, discount rate, interest expense and other factors may change in light of changes in the economic and competitive environment in which we operate.   
  While the operating results for the Oil Gas   Chemical and Industrial segments indicated a loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company does not consider these results to be a triggering event requiring the performance of an interim goodwill impairment test since the Company has not significantly changed its forecasts since the annual test was performed and the Company continues to consider these segments as core to its business and believes future performance will improve.  The Company will continue to monitor its operating results for indicators of impairment and perform additional tests as necessary. 
  Other Intangible Assets 
  Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized by the straight-line method over their useful lives ranging from 1.5 to 15 years.  The Company evaluates intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  The Company did not observe any events or circumstances during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that would indicate that the carrying value of its intangible assets may not be recoverable.  The Company's evaluation included values assigned to customer relationships in the iron and steel industry which is currently experiencing short to medium term weakness.  If the Company's view of this market adversely changes or if other factors develop which change our view of the value of these relationships, the Company will reevaluate this conclusion.

Unapproved Change Orders and Claims 
  Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues for unapproved change orders and claims of   $26.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $10.3 million   at   June 30, 2016  .  During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recognized $7.7 million of unapproved change orders and a $15.0 million claim in connection with its ongoing work on a gas fired generating facility being constructed in Canada.  The amounts ultimately realized may be significantly different than the recorded amounts resulting in a material adjustment to future earnings. 
  Insurance Reserves 
  We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations.  However, we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles, self-insured retentions and coverage limits.  We establish reserves for claims using a combination of actuarially determined estimates and management judgment on a case-by-case basis and update our evaluations as further information becomes known.  Judgments and assumptions, including the assumed losses for claims incurred but not reported, are inherent in our reserve accruals; as a result, changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in changes to these estimates in the future.  If actual results of claim settlements are different than the amounts estimated, we may be exposed to gains and losses that could be significant. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
  Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) 
  On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09.  The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  The core principle of the revenue model is that  an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.   The ASU also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enables users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The ASU's disclosure requirements are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards.  The ASU applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). 
  The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted on a limited basis.  Upon adoption, the Company may elect one of two application methods, a full retrospective application or a modified retrospective application.  We expect to adopt this standard on July 1, 2018 and are currently evaluating its expected impact on our financial statements. 
  Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern    
  On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, which provides guidance on determining when and how reporting entities must disclose going-concern uncertainties in their financial statements.  The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date of issuance of the entity s financial statements.  Further, an entity must provide certain disclosures if there is  substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.   The FASB believes that requiring management to perform the assessment will enhance the timeliness, clarity, and consistency of related disclosures and improve convergence with international financial reporting standards ("IFRSs") (which emphasize management s responsibility for performing the going-concern assessment).  However, the time horizon for the assessment (look-forward period) and the disclosure thresholds under U.S. GAAP and IFRSs will continue to differ.  The ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter; early adoption is permitted. 
  The ASU was adopted during the Company's first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016.  In connection with the adoption of the ASU, the Company now performs an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern on a quarterly basis.  Disclosure regarding the status of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is required when there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.

Accounting Standards Update 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments    
  On September 25, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments.  The ASU was issued in response to stakeholder feedback that restatements of prior periods to reflect adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination increase the cost and complexity of financial reporting but do not significantly improve the usefulness of the information.  Under the ASU, an acquirer must recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The ASU also requires acquirers to present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We adopted this standard on July 1, 2016 with no material impact to the Company's financial statements. 
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02. The amendments in this update require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the ASU's expected impact on our financial statements. 
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which simplified several aspects of accounting for stock-based compensation transactions, including the accounting for income taxes and forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements.  The ASU is effective for the Company on July 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company adopted the ASU during its first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016.  The following is a description of the key provisions of the ASU and their impacts to the Company's financial statements: 
  Accounting for Income Taxes  : The amendments require the Company to recognize excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies in its provision for income taxes in its consolidated statements of income during the period of vesting or exercise of its nonvested deferred share awards and stock options, respectively, for which it expects to receive an income tax deduction.  Previously, the Company recognized any excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital ("APIC") in the balance sheet and any tax deficiencies were recognized as a reduction of APIC to the extent the Company has accumulated excess tax benefits.  Any tax deficiencies in excess of accumulated excess tax benefits in APIC were recognized in the provision for income taxes.  The amendments also require the Company to only present excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the operating section of its statements of cash flows as a component of deferred tax activity.  Previously, the Company was required to present such items in both the financing section and operating section of its statements of cash flows.  Amendments related to the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income are required to be applied prospectively, and amendments related to the cash flow statement presentation of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies may be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. 
  The Company applied the amendments requiring the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income prospectively.  As a result, the Company recognized $0.4 million of excess tax benefits in its provision for income taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.01.  Under the prior accounting standard, the Company would have recognized the excess tax benefits in equity as additional paid-in capital.  The amendments relating to the presentation of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the statement of cash flows were applied retrospectively.  The effect of the retrospective adjustment was to eliminate the presentation of an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow for excess tax benefits on exercised stock options and vesting of deferred shares.  These eliminations reduced both net cash used by operating activities and net cash provided by financing activities by less than $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Net cash flows did not change as a result of the retrospective adjustment.

Accounting for Forfeitures  :  The amendments in this ASU allow the Company to elect, as a company-wide accounting policy, either to continue to estimate the amount of forfeitures to exclude from compensation expense or to exclude forfeitures from compensation expense as they occur.  Upon the adoption of the ASU during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.  The Company is required to apply these amendments on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year.  The Company recorded a modified retrospective adjustment to reduce the June 30, 2016 retained earnings balance and increase the additional paid-in capital balance by $0.1 million each. 
  Statutory Tax Withholding Requirements  : Under the prior accounting standard, an entire award must be classified as a liability if the fair value of the shares withheld exceeds the Company's minimum statutory withholding obligation.  Under the ASU, the Company is allowed to withhold shares with a fair value up to the amount of tax owed using the maximum statutory tax rate in the employee's applicable jurisdictions.  The Company is allowed to determine one maximum rate for all employees in each jurisdiction, rather than a rate for each employee in the jurisdiction.  Also, the ASU requires that cash outflows to reacquire shares withheld for taxes to be classified in the financing section of the statement of cash flows.   
  The Company adopted the ASU during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  Since the Company did not have any awards classified as liabilities due to statutory tax withholding requirements as of September 30, 2016, and since the Company already presented its cash outflows for reacquiring shares withheld for taxes as a financing activity in its statements of cash flows, these amendments did not have any impact on its financial statements upon adoption.  The Company does not expect changes to employee withholdings  for stock compensation to have a material impact to the financial statements. 
  Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which changes how the Company accounts for its allowance for uncollectible accounts. The amendments in this update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The income statement will reflect any increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount.  
  Current GAAP delays the recognition of the full amount of credit losses until the loss is probable of occurring.  The amendments in this update eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold and, instead, reflect the Company's current estimate of all expected credit losses.  In addition, current guidance limits the information the Company may consider in measuring a credit loss to its past events and current conditions.  The amendments in this update broaden the information the Company may consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate to include forecasted information.  
  The amendments in this update are effective for the Company on July 1, 2020 and the Company may early adopt on July 1, 2019.  The Company must apply the amendments in this update through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.  At this time, the Company does not expect this update to have a material impact to its estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Overview 
  We operate our business through four reportable segments: Electrical Infrastructure, Oil Gas   Chemical, Storage Solutions, and Industrial.  
  The Electrical Infrastructure segment primarily encompasses construction and maintenance services to a variety of power generation facilities, such as combined cycle plants, natural gas fired power stations, and renewable energy installations.  We also provide high voltage services to investor owned utilities, including construction of new substations, upgrades of existing substations, short-run transmission line installations, distribution upgrades and maintenance, and storm restoration services.  
  The Oil Gas   Chemical segment includes turnaround activities, plant maintenance services and construction in the downstream petroleum industry.  Another key offering is industrial cleaning services, which include hydroblasting, hydroexcavating, chemical cleaning and vacuum services.  We also perform work in the petrochemical, natural gas, gas processing and compression, and upstream petroleum markets.  
  The Storage Solutions segment includes new construction of crude and refined products aboveground storage tanks ( ASTs ), as well as planned and emergency maintenance services.  The Storage Solutions segment also includes balance of plant work in storage terminals and tank farms.  Also included in the Storage Solutions segment is work related to specialty storage tanks, including liquefied natural gas ( LNG ), liquid nitrogen/liquid oxygen ( LIN/LOX ), liquid petroleum ( LPG ) tanks and other specialty vessels, including spheres.  Finally, we offer AST products, including geodesic domes, aluminum internal floating roofs, floating suction and skimmer systems, roof drain systems and floating roof seals.  
  The Industrial segment includes construction and maintenance work in the iron and steel and mining and minerals industries.  Our work in the mining and minerals industry is primarily for customers engaged in the extraction of copper.  We also perform work in bulk material handling and fertilizer production facilities, thermal vacuum chambers, and other industrial markets. 
  Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  Consolidated 
  Consolidated revenue was   $341.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $319.3 million   in the same period in the prior fiscal year.  On a segment basis, consolidated revenue increased in the Storage Solutions and Electrical Infrastructure segments by $55.3 million and $22.4 million, respectively.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue in the Oil Gas   Chemical and Industrial segments of $35.8 million and $19.4 million, respectively. 
  Consolidated gross profit decreased from $  34.6 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $32.3 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .  Gross margin decreased to 9.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 10.8% in the same period in the prior fiscal year.  The reduction in gross margin in fiscal 2017 is primarily attributable to a project charge related to the construction of a power generating facility more fully discussed in Note 3 - Uncompleted Contracts and increased under recovery of construction overhead costs in the Oil Gas   Chemical and Industrial segments largely related to the reduction in volume in the current year. 
  Consolidated SG A expenses were   $18.0 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $19.5 million   in the same period a year earlier.  The lower SG A expenses in fiscal 2017 was due to a reduction in the IT costs charged to the administrative portion of the business.  Excluding the change in allocation method, there were no significant variances in SG A expense in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior fiscal year. 
  Net interest expense was   $0.2 million   in each of the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
  Our effective tax rate for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   33.6%   compared to   34.3%   in the same period a year earlier.  The fiscal 2017 tax rate was positively impacted by a discrete item related to the excess tax benefit realized upon the vesting of deferred shares which is more fully described in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies.  The fiscal 2016 tax rate was positively impacted by a discrete item related to our Canadian operations. 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , net income attributable to Matrix Service Company and the related fully diluted earnings per share were   $9.3 million   and   $0.35   compared to   $9.9 million   and   $0.37   in the same period a year earlier.

Electrical Infrastructure 
  Revenue for the Electrical Infrastructure segment increased $22.4 million to $88.0 million in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $65.6 million   in the same period a year earlier as a result from continued work on a power generating facility being constructed in Canada.  The fiscal 2017 gross margin was   6.0%   compared to   7.2%   in the same period last year.  The reduction in gross margin in fiscal 2017 is primarily attributable to a project charge related to the construction of the power generating facility mentioned above and more fully discussed in Note 3 - Uncompleted Contracts, lower margin work in our high voltage distribution business and, while improved, the under recovery of overhead costs.  
  Oil Gas   Chemical 
  Revenue for the Oil Gas   Chemical segment was   $32.5 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $68.3 million   in the same period a year earlier.  The decrease of $35.8 million is related to lower volume across the business as refiners continue to limit spending as the result of continued volatility in commodity prices. The gross margin was break-even for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   8.3%   in the same period last year.  The gross margin for fiscal 2017 was affected by  lower volume which led to the under recovery of overhead costs and an audit settlement with a customer.  
  Storage Solutions 
  Revenue for the Storage Solutions segment was   $199.5 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $144.2 million   in the same period a year earlier, an increase of  38.3%.  The increase is primarily attributable to increased activity on a previously announced project for the construction of crude gathering terminals that support the Dakota Access Pipeline.  The gross margin was   13.3%   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   14.0%   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   as a result of effective project execution in both periods.  
  Industrial 
  Revenue for the Industrial segment decreased $19.4 million to $21.8 million in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $41.2 million   in the same period a year earlier.  The decline in revenue is primarily attributable to lower business volumes in the iron and steel and mining markets, and lower revenue recognized on a large fertilizer project that is nearing completion.  The gross margin was   2.6%   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   9.6%   in the same period a year earlier.  The fiscal 2017 gross margin was negatively impacted by the under recovery of construction overhead costs due to reduced volume. The fiscal 2016 gross margin was positively impacted by the mix of work and strong project execution. 
  Backlog 
  We define backlog as the total dollar amount of revenue that we expect to recognize as a result of performing work that has been awarded to us through a signed contract, notice to proceed or other type of assurance that we consider firm.  The following arrangements are considered firm: 

fixed-price awards; 

minimum customer commitments on cost plus arrangements; and 

certain time and material arrangements in which the estimated value is firm or can be estimated with a reasonable amount of certainty in both timing and amounts. 
     For long-term maintenance contracts and other established customer arrangements, we include only the amounts that we expect to recognize into revenue over the next 12 months.  For all other arrangements, we calculate backlog as the estimated contract amount less revenue recognized as of the reporting date. 
  The following table provides a summary of changes in our backlog for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  :    

-   24  - 

Table of Contents  

Project awards in all segments are cyclical and are typically the result of a sales process that can take several months to complete.  Backlog in the Storage Solutions and Electrical Infrastructure segments generally have the greatest volatility because individual project awards can be less frequent and more significant. 
  The change in backlog in the Electrical Infrastructure segment is mainly attributable to the work related to the previously announced Napanee Power Generating Station project largely offset by power delivery awards which continue to meet the Company's expectations. 
  The increase in backlog in the Oil, Gas   Chemical segment is mainly attributable to increased project awards such as the previously announced Ultra-Low Gasoline Project awarded by KBR, Inc, partially offset by low volume in the Company's turnarounds and plant services. 
  The decline in backlog in the Storage Solutions Segment is attributable to the work related to the previously announced project for the construction of terminals supporting the Dakota Access Pipeline.  In addition, a more cautious approach to decision-making on the part of clients, together with more stringent financial and regulatory requirements, is delaying the timing of some of the larger awards.  Although we are seeing increased competition, awards for small and medium sized projects are generally meeting the Company's expectations. 
  Seasonality and Other Factors 
  Our operating results can exhibit seasonal fluctuations, especially in our Oil Gas   Chemical segment, for a variety of reasons.  Turnarounds and planned outages at customer facilities are typically scheduled in the spring and the fall when the demand for energy is lower.  Within the Electrical Infrastructure segment, transmission and distribution work is generally scheduled by the public utilities when the demand for electricity is at its lowest.  Therefore, revenue volume in the summer months is typically lower than in other periods throughout the year.  Also, we typically see a lower level of operating activity relating to construction projects during the winter months and early in the calendar year because many of our customers  capital budgets have not been finalized.  Our business can also be affected, both positively and negatively, by seasonal factors such as energy demand or weather conditions including hurricanes, snowstorms, and abnormally low or high temperatures.  Some of these seasonal factors may cause some of our offices and projects to close or reduce activities temporarily.  In addition to the above noted factors, the general timing of project starts and completions could exhibit significant fluctuations.  Accordingly, results for any interim period may not necessarily be indicative of operating results for the full year.  
  Other factors impacting operating results in all segments come from work site permitting delays or customers accelerating or postponing work.  The differing types, sizes, and durations of our contracts, combined with their geographic diversity and stages of completion, often results in fluctuations in the Company's operating results. 
  Impact of Commodity Price Volatility    
  The prolonged decline in crude prices continues to impact our income from operations and project awards, particularly in the Oil Gas   Chemical and Storage Solutions segments.  The Industrial segment continues to be negatively impacted by the low prices of other commodities, principally steel and copper.  The decline in commodity prices has not had, and we do not expect a significant impact on the Electrical Infrastructure segment.  
  In the midstream and downstream portions of the Oil Gas   Chemical segment, we continue to see lower volumes of routine maintenance and turnaround work as well as a general slowdown of capital projects.  Additionally, since some of our mid and downstream customers are integrated oil companies with exposure to the price of crude, if the prices remain at current levels or decline further, spending levels may continue to be reduced.  Our exposure to non-integrated upstream clients in the Oil Gas   Chemical segment is not significant.  
  In our Storage Solutions segment, our customers continue to take a long-term view of the market, but continue to be cautious short-term, particularly on larger projects.  Based on current market conditions, we are seeing a reduction in customer spending and project award delays.  Although we are seeing signs of market improvement, we cannot predict the direction of commodity prices or our customers  ultimate reaction to the market and therefore cannot predict the magnitude of the impact to our future earnings.

In the Industrial segment, our iron and steel customers face significant uncertainty related to the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the related impact on steel imports and steel prices, the strong United States Dollar, the domestic demand for steel and the impact of anti-dumping duties on steel imports.  This uncertainty has reduced the capital, expansion and elective maintenance spending of our customers.  Although we are seeing some encouraging signs in the market, we do not expect higher levels of spending until the overall uncertainty in this market is reduced and economic conditions within the industry improve. In the mining and minerals markets, we continue to see lower spending due to the softness of other commodity prices, particularly copper, to which our clients are exposed. 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
  EBITDA is a supplemental, non-GAAP financial measure.  EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  We have presented EBITDA because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses.  We believe that the line item on our Consolidated Statements of Income entitled  Net Income  is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA.  Since EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance.  EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, this measure is not a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.  As EBITDA excludes certain financial information compared with net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions that are excluded.  Our non-GAAP performance measure, EBITDA, has certain material limitations as follows: 

It does not include interest expense.  Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations, pay commitment fees to maintain our credit facility, and incur fees to issue letters of credit under the credit facility, interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue.  Therefore, any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations. 

It does not include income taxes.  Because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations, any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations. 

It does not include depreciation or amortization expense.  Because we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our cost structure.  Therefore, any measure that excludes depreciation or amortization expense has material limitations. 
     A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income follows: 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
  Overview 
  We define liquidity as the ongoing ability to pay our liabilities as they become due, fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations.  Our primary sources of liquidity for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were cash on hand, capacity under our senior revolving credit facility and cash generated from operations before consideration of changes in working capital.  Cash on hand at   September 30, 2016   totaled   $35.6 million   and availability under the senior revolving credit facility totaled   $137.6 million   resulting in available liquidity of $  173.2 million  .   
  
   -   26  - 

Table of Contents  

Factors that routinely impact our short-term liquidity and may impact our long-term liquidity include, but are not limited to: 
             
    Changes in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs due to contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings 

Some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers. 

Time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears.  Therefore, we are routinely required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected. 

Some of our large construction projects may require significant retentions or security in the form of letters of credit. 

Other changes in working capital 

Capital expenditures 
     Other factors that may impact both short and long-term liquidity include: 

Acquisitions of new businesses 

Strategic investments in new operations 

Purchases of shares under our stock buyback program 

Contract disputes which can be significant 

Collection issues, including those caused by weak commodity prices or other factors which can lead to credit deterioration of our customers 

Capacity constraints under our credit facility and remaining in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement 

A default by one of the major financial institutions for which our deposits exceed insured deposit limits 

Cash on hand outside of the United States that cannot be repatriated without incremental taxation. 
     As discussed under the caption "Senior Revolving Credit Facility" included in this Financial Condition and Liquidity section of the Form 10-Q, our Credit Agreement includes a Senior Leverage Ratio covenant, which provides that Consolidated Funded Indebtedness, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, may not exceed 2.5 times Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, over the previous four quarters.  Consequently, recent operating results have caused a short term capacity constraint on the Company's senior revolving credit facility.  Although the constraint reduces our liquidity, the Company believes that the remaining availability under our senior revolving credit facility along with cash on hand and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to achieve both our short-term and long-term business objectives.  However, if we were to complete a significant acquisition for cash, it is possible that we would need to increase the size of our credit facility.

Cash Flow for the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016    
  Cash Flows Used by Operating Activities 
  Cash used by operating activities for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   totaled   $49.6 million  .  The various components are as follows: 
    
  Net Cash Used by Operating Activities 
  (In thousands) 

Working capital changes at   September 30, 2016   in comparison to June 30, 2016 include the following: 

Accounts receivable, net of bad debt expense recognized during the period, increased by   $40.6 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The variance is primarily attributable to the timing of billing and collections in connection with the previously announced Dakota Access Project.  

Accounts payable decreased by   $13.6 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .  The variance is primarily attributable to the timing of vendor payments.  Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts ("CIE") increased $1.1 million million while billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of costs and estimated earnings ("BIE") decreased $5.9 million.  The net change in CIE and BIE decreased cash   $7.0 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  CIE and BIE balances can experience significant fluctuations based on the timing of when job costs are incurred, the invoicing of those job costs to the customer, and other working capital management factors.  
       
  Cash Flows Used for Investing Activities 
  Investing activities used   $1.7 million   of cash in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to capital expenditures.  Capital expenditures consisted of purchases of: $1.2 million for office equipment, $0.2 million for construction equipment, $0.2 million for transportation and fabrication equipment, and $0.1 million for land and buildings.  Proceeds from asset sales provided $0.2 million of cash.  
  Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
  Financing activities provided   $15.4 million   of cash in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   primarily due to net borrowings of $17.2 million under our credit facility and the repurchase of $1.9 million of Company stock for payment of withholding taxes due on equity-based compensation. 
  Senior Revolving Credit Facility 
  As noted previously in     Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,   the Company has a five-year $200.0 million   senior secured revolving credit facility under a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") that expires March 13, 2019.  
  The Credit Agreement includes the following covenants and borrowing limitations: 
             
    Our Senior Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, may not exceed 2.50 to 1.00, determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter. 
                
    We are required to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement, greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00, determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter. 
     
   -   28  - 

Table of Contents  

Asset dispositions (other than inventory and obsolete or unneeded equipment disposed of in the ordinary course of business) are limited to $20.0 million per 12-month period. 
     Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR or an Alternate Base Rate, plus in each case, an additional margin based on the Senior Leverage Ratio.  The additional margin on Alternate Base Rate and LIBOR-based loans ranges between 0.25% and 1.0% and between 1.25% and 2.0%, respectively. 
  The Credit Agreement also permits us to borrow in Canadian dollars with a sublimit of U.S. $40.0 million.  Amounts borrowed in Canadian dollars will bear interest either at the CDOR Rate, plus an additional margin based on the Senior Leverage Ratio ranging from 1.25% to 2.0%, or at the Canadian Prime Rate, plus an additional margin based on the Senior Leverage Ratio ranging from 1.75% to 2.5%.  The CDOR Rate is equal to the  sum of the annual rate of interest, which is the rate determined as being the arithmetic average of the quotations of all institutions listed in respect of the relevant CDOR interest period for Canadian Dollar denominated bankers  acceptances, plus 0.1%.  The Canadian Prime Rate is equal to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum most recently announced or established by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch as its reference rate in effect on such day for determining interest rates for Canadian Dollar denominated commercial loans in Canada and (ii) the CDOR Rate plus 1.0%.  
  The Unused Credit Facility Fee is between 0.20% and 0.35% based on the Senior Leverage Ratio. 
  The Credit Agreement includes a Senior Leverage Ratio covenant,  which provides that Consolidated Funded Indebtedness, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, may not exceed 2.5 times Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, over the previous four quarters.  For the four quarters ended   September 30, 2016  , Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, was   $70.2 million  .  Accordingly, at   September 30, 2016  , there was a restriction on our ability to access the full amount of the credit facility.  However, any continued constraint in future fiscal periods is not expected to impact our ability to operate the business.  Consolidated Funded Indebtedness at   September 30, 2016   was   $30.1 million  . 
  Availability under the senior credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   was as follows:    

Outstanding borrowings at   September 30, 2016   primarily consisted funds borrowed for working capital needs in our Canadian business due to the timing of collections and disbursements on the previously announced power generating project. 
  The Company is in compliance with all affirmative, negative, and financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
  Dividend Policy 
  We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, and the terms of our Credit Agreement limit the amount of cash dividends we can pay.  Under our Credit Agreement, we may declare and pay dividends on our capital stock during any fiscal year up to an amount which, when added to all other dividends paid during such fiscal year, does not exceed 50% of our cumulative net income for such fiscal year to such date.  While we currently do not intend to pay cash dividends, any future dividend payments will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements and earnings as well as other relevant factors.

Stock Repurchase Program and Treasury Shares 
  Treasury Shares 
  On November 4, 2014 the Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program that replaced the program that had previously been in place.  The program, which expires on December 31, 2016, allows the Company to purchase up to $25.0 million of common stock annually if sufficient liquidity exists and management believes the purchase would be beneficial to the Company's stockholders.  The annual $25.0 million limitation is applied on a calendar year basis.  The cumulative number of shares repurchased cannot exceed 2,653,399, which represents 10% of the shares outstanding on the date the new repurchase program was approved.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has purchased 938,730 shares under the program, none of which were purchased during fiscal 2017. 
  In addition to the stock buyback program, the Company may withhold shares of common stock to satisfy the tax withholding obligations upon vesting of an employee s deferred shares.  Matrix withheld 113,762 shares in the first three months of fiscal   2017   to satisfy these obligations.  These shares were returned to the Company s pool of treasury shares. 
  The Company has 1,360,157 treasury shares as of   September 30, 2016   and intends to utilize these treasury shares solely in connection with equity awards under the Company s stock incentive plans.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-Q which address activities, events or developments which we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.  The words  believes,   intends,   expects,   anticipates,   projects,   estimates,   predicts  and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
  These forward-looking statements include, among others, such things as: 
             
    the impact to our business of crude oil and other commodity prices; 

amounts and nature of future revenues and margins from each of our segments; 

trends in the industries we serve; 

our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations or to raise cash in order to meet our short and long-term capital requirements;  

the likely impact of new or existing regulations or market forces on the demand for our services; 

expansion and other trends of the industries we serve; 

our expectations with respect to the likelihood of a future impairment; and 

our ability to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement. 
       
  These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses we made in light of our experience and our historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate.  However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including: 

the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016   and listed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; 

economic, market or business conditions in general and in the oil, gas, power, iron and steel and mining industries in particular;  

reduced creditworthiness of our customer base and the higher risk of non-payment of receivables due to low prevailing crude oil and other commodity prices; 

the inherently uncertain outcome of current and future litigation; 

the adequacy of our reserves for contingencies; 

changes in laws or regulations; and 

other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
     Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences or effects on our business operations.  We assume no obligation to update publicly, except as required by law, any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  There have been no material changes in market risk faced by us from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  For more information on market risk, see Part II, Item 7A in our fiscal   2016   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of  disclosure controls and procedures  in Rule 13a-15(e). 
  The disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors or fraud.  The design of our internal control system takes into account the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be weighed against the costs.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the acts of key individuals, collusion or management override. 
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level at   September 30, 2016  . 
  There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.

  Dear  FirstName : 
    
  1.      Award  .  The awards set forth in this Award Agreement (the "  Award Agreement  ") are subject to your acceptance of and agreement to all of the applicable terms, conditions, and restrictions described in the 2012 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "  Plan  "), of Matrix Service Company, a Delaware corporation (the "  Company  ") a copy of which is on file with, and may be obtained from, the Secretary of the Company, and to your acceptance of and agreement to the further terms, conditions, and restrictions described in this Award Agreement.  To the extent that any provision of this Award Agreement conflicts with the expressly applicable terms of the Plan, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that those terms of the Plan shall control and, if necessary, the applicable provisions of this Award Agreement shall be hereby deemed amended so as to carry out the purpose and intent of the Plan. 
    
  2.      Restricted Stock Units and Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Award.   
    
  (a)      Restricted Stock Units and Performance Units Awards.    The Company hereby grants to you an aggregate of up to ____ restricted stock units (individually, an "  RSU  ," and collectively, "  RSUs  ") as more specifically set forth in Section 2(f).  Each RSU entitles you to receive one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "  Shares  ") at such time as the restrictions described in Section 2(e)(ii) lapse as described in Section 2(f)(i).  In addition, the Company hereby grants to you an aggregate of up to ____ performance units (individually, a "  Performance Unit  ," and collectively, "  Performance Units  ").  Each Performance Unit entitles you to receive up to two Shares at such time as the restrictions described in Section 2(e)(ii) lapse as described in Section 2(f)(ii). 
    
  (b)      Form of Restricted Stock; Possession of Certificates.    The Company shall issue the Shares you become entitled to receive hereunder by book-entry registration or by issuance of a certificate or certificates for the Shares in your name as soon as practicable after the restrictions in Section 2(e)(ii) lapse as described in Section 2(f).  In the event the Company issues a certificate or certificates for the Shares, such certificates shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the committee of the Board of Directors that administers the Plan may deem necessary or advisable under the Plan and rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares are then listed, and any applicable foreign, federal or state securities laws.   
    
  (c)      Stockholder Rights Prior to Issuance of Shares.    Neither you nor any of your beneficiaries shall be deemed to have any voting rights, rights to receive dividends or other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares covered by the RSUs or the Performance Units until the date of book-entry registration or issuance by the Company of a certificate to you for such Shares.  
    
  (d)      Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Award.    In addition to the RSUs and Performance Units, the Company hereby grants to you a cash-based long-term incentive award, hereinafter referred to as the "  Performance Cash Award  ."  The minimum award is zero, the target award is $____ (the "  Target Award  ") and the maximum award is $____ (the "  Maximum Award  ").  The amount that will be paid in respect of the Performance Cash Award will be determined based on the Company's Return on Invested Capital ("  ROIC  "), as otherwise set forth herein and more fully described below.  This Performance Cash Award entitles you to receive up to the Maximum Award at such time as the restrictions described in Section 2(e) lapse as described in Section 2(f) if the Maximum Performance Goal (as defined below) for ROIC established by the Committee is achieved.   

(e)      Restrictions. 
    
  (i)    Your ownership of the RSUs and Performance Units and your right to receive the Performance Cash Award shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection (ii) of this Section 2(e) until such restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of Section 2(f). 
    
  (ii)    The restrictions referred to in subsection (i) of this Section 2(e) are as follows: 
    
  (A)    At the time of your termination of employment with the Company or an Affiliate, other than a termination of employment that occurs as a result of an event described in any of Subsections (iv) through (vii) of Section 2(f), you shall forfeit the RSUs, Performance Units and the Performance Cash Award to the Company and all of your rights thereto shall terminate without any payment of consideration by the Company.   
    
  (B)    You may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any RSUs or Performance Units, any portion of the Performance Cash Award or any rights under the RSUs, Performance Units or Performance Cash Award.  No RSU, Performance Unit or Performance Cash Award and no rights under any such RSU, Performance Unit or Performance Cash Award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  If you or anyone claiming under or through you attempts to violate this Section 2(e)(ii)(B), such attempted violation shall be null and void and without effect, and all of the Company's obligations hereunder shall terminate. 
    
  (f)      Lapse of Restrictions. 
    
  (i)    The restrictions described in Section 2(e)(ii) shall lapse with respect to the RSUs in four equal installments of 25 percent each on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of this Award Agreement, such that the restrictions set forth in Section 2(e)(ii) shall have lapsed with respect to 100 percent of the RSUs on the fourth anniversary of the date of this Award Agreement. 
    
  (ii)    The restrictions described in Section 2(e)(ii) shall lapse with respect to the Performance Units on the __ anniversary of the date of this Award Agreement (the "  Measurement Date  "), but only if and to the extent the Committee certifies in writing that the "  Shareholder Return Goals  " set forth in this subsection (ii) are met.  The Shareholder Return Goals are as follows: 

Shareholder  
  Return Goal 

Total  
  Shareholder Return 
    Percentage of Performance Units for Which 
  Conditions are Satisfied 

Threshold Total Shareholder Return Goal 
    ___ percentile of Peer Group 
    ___% 
      Above Threshold Total Shareholder Return Goal 
    ___ percentile of Peer Group 
    ___% 
      Target Total Shareholder Return Goal 

Above Target Total Shareholder Return Goal 
    
  Maximum Total Shareholder Return Goal 
    
    ___ percentile of Peer Group 

___ percentile of Peer Group 

___ percentile of Peer Group 
    ___% 

___% 

___% 

The Committee shall certify on a nondiscretionary basis whether and the extent to which the Shareholder Return Goals have been met on or before the date on which the Company is required to make a book-entry registration or issue a certificate for Shares relating to the achievement of Shareholder Return Goals as set forth in Section 2(f)(viii).  In the event the Committee certifies that the Threshold Total Shareholder Return Goal has not been met, then all of the Performance Units will be forfeited to the Company.  In the event the Committee certifies that the Company has achieved the Maximum Total Shareholder Return Goal, the conditions shall be deemed to have been satisfied and the restrictions on a number of Performance Units equal to all of the Performance Units multiplied by two shall be removed as of the Measurement Date.  In the event the Committee certifies that the Company has achieved a Total Shareholder Return that is between any of the Total Shareholder Return Goals set forth above, then the conditions with respect to the Performance Units shall be deemed to have been met for the number of Performance Units determined by linear interpolation between such Shareholder Return Goals and the restrictions on such Performance Units shall be removed as of the Measurement Date and the remainder of the Performance Units will be forfeited to the Company.  The Committee has the final authority to determine on a nondiscretionary basis whether the Shareholder Return Goals have been met and to what extent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Award Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Committee certifies that the Company has achieved a Total Shareholder Return which is above the 75   th    percentile of the Peer Group but the Total Shareholder Return of the Company is less than zero, then the conditions with respect to the Performance Units shall be deemed to have been satisfied and the restrictions on a number of Performance Units equal to the Above Target Total Shareholder Return Goal shall be removed as of the Measurement Date and the remainder of the Performance Units will be forfeited to the Company. 
  For purposes of measuring the Shareholder Return Goals with respect to the Company and each of the companies in the Peer Group: "  Total Shareholder Return  " shall mean the total shareholder return calculated by subtracting 1 from the following fraction: 
  Numerator: Ending Stock Value  
  Denominator: Beginning Stock Value 
  "  Beginning Stock Value  " shall mean, with respect to the Company and each of the companies in the Peer Group, $100, invested in common stock at the average closing stock price of such company for each of the trading days in the period covering April, May and June of _____; "  Ending Stock Value  " shall mean, with respect to the Company and each of the companies in the Peer Group, the average closing stock price of such company of one share of common stock for each of the trading days in the period covering April, May and June of _____     multiplied by the sum of the number of shares represented by the Beginning Stock Value initial $100 investment plus such additional shares resulting from all dividends paid on common stock during the three-year measurement period being treated as though they are reinvested on the applicable ex-dividend dates at the applicable closing prices on such dates; and "  Peer Group  " shall mean _______________.  The Company's ranking relative to members of the Peer Group will be determined by listing the Company and members of the Peer Group from highest to lowest Total Shareholder Return achieved by the respective company and counting down from the company with the highest Total Shareholder Return to the Company's position within such list.  In all events, the Total Shareholder Return of any member of the Peer Group shall be adjusted to give effect to any stock dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits and similar transactions.  If a company or companies in the Peer Group files for bankruptcy at any time prior to the Measurement Date, then such company or companies shall have the lowest ranking in the Peer Group.  If the common stock of a company or companies in the Peer Group ceases to trade on a national securities exchange as a result of a going private transaction or other acquisition at any time prior to the Measurement Date, then such company or companies shall be removed from the Peer Group.   
  (iii)    The restrictions described in Section 2(e)(ii) shall lapse with respect to the Performance Cash Award on the second anniversary of the date of this Award Agreement (the "  ROIC Measurement Date  "), but only if and to the extent the Committee certifies in writing that the   ROIC Performance Goals   set forth in this subsection (iii) are met.  The ROIC Performance Goals are as follows: 

ROIC Level 
      
    Average ROIC 
      
  Percentage of Performance Cash Award for Which 
  Conditions are Satisfied 

Threshold ROIC Goal 
      
    ___% 
    ___% 

Target ROIC Goal 
      
    ___% 
    ___% 
      Maximum ROIC Goal 
      
    ___% 
    ___% 

The Committee shall certify on a nondiscretionary basis whether and the extent to which the ROIC Performance Goals have been met on or before the date on which the Company is required to issue you a check in redemption of your Performance Cash Award as set forth in Section 2(f)(viii).  In the event the Committee certifies that the Threshold ROIC Performance Goal has not been met, then all of the Performance Cash Award will be forfeited to the Company.  In the event the Committee certifies that the Maximum ROIC Goal has been met, the conditions shall be deemed to have been met for a Performance Cash Award equal to __% of the Target Performance Cash Award.  In the event the Committee certifies that the Company has achieved an ROIC that is between the Threshold ROIC Performance Goal and the Target ROIC Performance Goal or between the Target ROIC Performance Goal and the Maximum ROIC Performance Goal set forth above, then the conditions with respect to the Performance Cash Award shall be deemed to have been met for a percentage of the Performance Cash Award determined by linear interpolation between such ROIC Performance Goals and the restrictions on such Performance Cash Award shall be removed as of the ROIC Measurement Date and the remainder of the Performance Cash Award will be forfeited.  The Committee has the final authority to determine on a nondiscretionary basis whether the ROIC Performance Goals have been met and to what extent.  
    
  For purposes of measuring the ROIC Performance Goals, "  Average ROIC  " shall mean ROIC for fiscal ___ and fiscal ___ divided by 2, and "  ROIC  " is the percentage derived from the following fraction: 
    
  Numerator: Operating Income x (1 - Tax Rate) 
    
  Denominator: (prior year-end Total Assets + current year-end Total Assets/2) - (prior year-end Current Liabilities + current year-end Current liabilities/2) - (prior year-end Cash + current year-end Cash/2) 
    
  (iv)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 2(f), the restrictions described in Section 2(e)(ii) shall lapse with respect to the RSUs, the Performance Units and the Performance Cash Award (as if each of the Target Total Shareholder Return Goal and Target Performance Cash Award had been met) upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 
    
  (1)    Your death or "  Disability  "; or 
    
  (2)    A Change of Control of the Company. 
           
  The term "  Disability  " shall mean your inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  For purposes of this Section 2(f)(iv), the Target Performance Goal shall be deemed to have been met on the date the restrictions lapse by reason of the occurrence prior to the Measurement Date or ROIC Measurement Date of any of the foregoing events, so that the conditions on issuance of 100 percent of the Performance Units and the Target Performance Cash Award shall be deemed satisfied on the date of such event. 
    
  (v)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) of this Section 2(f), upon the occurrence of your "  Retirement  ," the restrictions described in Section 2(e)(ii) shall lapse with respect to a number of RSUs  

determined as follows: (x) the total number of RSUs awarded to you hereunder multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of full and partial months elapsed from the date of the Award to the date of your Retirement, and the denominator of which is 48, minus (y) the total number of RSUs which previously lapsed under Subsection (i) of this Section 2(f). 
    
  The term "  Retirement  " or "  Retire  " shall mean your voluntary "  Separation from Service  " (as defined in Code Section 409A), on or after the date on which you attain age 65. 
    
  (vi)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (ii) of this Section 2(f), in the event that you Retire prior to the Measurement Date and the Committee subsequently determines and certifies that the Company has achieved a Shareholder Return Goal at a level at or above the Threshold Shareholder Return Goal, the restrictions described in Section 2(e)(ii) shall lapse with respect to a pro rata number of Performance Units equal to the total number of Performance Units for which the restrictions would have lapsed on the Measurement Date under Subsection (ii) of this Section 2(f) if you had not Retired prior to the Measurement Date, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of full and partial months elapsed from the date of the Award to the date of your Retirement, and the denominator of which is 36. 
    
  (vii)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (iii) of this Section 2(f), in the event that you Retire prior to the ROIC Measurement Date and the Committee subsequently determines and certifies that the Company has achieved an ROIC Goal at a level at or above the Threshold ROIC Goal, the restrictions described in Section 2(e)(ii) shall lapse with respect to a pro rata portion of the Performance Cash Award equal to the total dollar amount for which the restrictions would have lapsed on the ROIC Measurement Date under Subsection (iii) of this Section 2(f) if you had not Retired prior to the ROIC Measurement Date, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of full and partial months elapsed from the date of the Award to the date of your Retirement, and the denominator of which is 24. 
    
  (viii)    On the date of the lapse of the restrictions in accordance with this Section 2(f), or in any event, no later than the earlier of ninety (90) days after such date or two and one half months following the end of the calendar year in which the restrictions lapsed in accordance with Section 2(f), the Company will make a book-entry registration or will issue you a certificate as provided in Section 2(c) of this Award Agreement for the Shares covered by such RSUs and Performance Units in redemption of such RSUs and Performance Units and will pay you by check in redemption of the Performance Cash Award.     
    
  3.      Agreement with Respect to Taxes; Share Withholding  .   
    
  (a)    You agree that (1) you will pay to the Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, in cash, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company or such Affiliate regarding the payment of any taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by the Company or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Performance Cash Award, the RSUs, the Performance Units and/or the Shares and (2) the Company or any of its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payments of any kind otherwise due to you any taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Performance Cash Award, the RSUs, the Performance Units and the Shares. 
    
  (b)    You agree that, if required by applicable law, you shall pay any taxes no later than the date as of which the value of the Performance Cash Award, RSUs, Performance Units and/or Shares first become includible in your gross income for income tax purposes; provided, however, that the Committee may, in accordance with Article 16 of the Plan, permit you to:  (i) elect withholding by the Company of cash and/or Shares otherwise deliverable to you pursuant to this Award Agreement (provided, however, that the amount of any Shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Company's or any Affiliate's required tax withholding of obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for Federal, state and/or local tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income or such other higher amount that will not cause adverse accounting consequences for the Company and is permitted under applicable withholding rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable governmental entity) and/or (ii) tender to the Company Shares owned by you (or by you and your spouse jointly) and acquired more than six (6) months prior to such tender in full or partial satisfaction of such tax obligations, based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the payment date as determined by the Committee.    
    
  4.      Adjustment of Shares.    The number of Shares subject to the RSUs and Performance Units awarded to you under this Award Agreement may be adjusted as provided in the Plan.   

5.      Agreement With Respect to Securities Matters.    You agree that you will not sell or otherwise transfer any Shares received pursuant to this Award Agreement except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration.  Unless a registration statement relating to the Shares issuable upon the lapse of the restrictions on the RSUs and Performance Units pursuant to this Award Agreement is in effect at the time of issuance of such Shares, the certificate(s) for the Shares shall contain the following legend:   
    
  The securities evidenced by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any other securities laws.  These securities have been acquired for investment and may not be sold or transferred for value in the absence of an effective registration of them under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and any other applicable securities laws, or receipt by the Company of an opinion of counsel or other evidence acceptable to the Company that such registration is not required under such acts.   
    
  6.      Forfeiture and Clawback.   
    
  (a)  You agree that in the event you violate the confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation or non-disparagement provisions of any agreement between you and the Company or any Affiliate, or any plan of the Company or any Affiliate in which you participate, including without limitation, the non-solicitation provisions of Section 7 below, you will forfeit in their entirety the Performance Cash Award, the RSUs and the Performance Units, and all of your rights thereto shall terminate without any payment of consideration by the Company.  
    
  (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, you acknowledge that any incentive-based compensation paid to you hereunder may be subject to recovery by the Company under any clawback policy which the Company may adopt from time to time, including without limitation the Company's existing policy and any policy which the Company may be required to adopt under Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder or the requirements of any national securities exchange on which the Company's common stock may be listed. You agree to promptly return any such incentive-based compensation which the Company determines it is required to recover from you under any such clawback policy.  
    
  7.      Non-Solicitation  .   
    
  (a)      Non-Solicitation of Employees  .  During the period beginning on the date of this Award Agreement and ending on the second anniversary of the date of your termination of employment with the Company or an Affiliate, regardless of the reason for your termination of employment, you shall not, directly, or indirectly by assisting others: (i) cause or attempt to cause or encourage any employee of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate his or her relationship with the Company or an Affiliate or (ii) solicit the employment or engagement as a consultant or adviser, of any employee of the Company or an Affiliate or any former employee of the Company or an Affiliate who left the employ of the Company or Affiliate within two years following your termination of employment with the Company or an Affiliate. 
    
  (b)      Reasonableness of Restriction  .  You agree and acknowledge that the above non-solicitation covenant is reasonable in the scope of activities restricted, the geographic area covered by the restriction and the duration of the restriction, and is necessary in that it protects the legitimate business interests of the Company and its Affiliates in its confidential information, its proprietary work, and its relationships with its employees, customers, suppliers and agents and that it does not unreasonably impair your ability to earn a livelihood or to support your dependants. 
    
  (c)      Irreparable Harm; Injunctive Relief  .  You agree and acknowledge that a violation by you of the non-solicitation covenant contained herein will result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  You hereby agree that the Company will be entitled, in addition to any remedies it might have under this Award Agreement or at law, to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any threatened or actual breach of this Award Agreement by you, without the posting of bond or other security. 
    
  (d)      Extension of Covenant  .  During any breach of the non-solicitation provisions of this Award Agreement, the period of restraint set forth herein shall be automatically tolled and suspended for the amount of time that the violation continues. 
    
  (e)      Survival of Covenants  .  Your obligations pursuant to this Section 7 shall survive the termination of this Award Agreement and the termination of your employment with the Company or an Affiliate. 

(f)      Attorneys' Fees  .  You agree to pay the Company any attorneys' fees and costs which the Company incurs in enforcing, to any extent, the provisions of this Section 7, whether or not litigation is actually commenced, and including any appeal. 
    
  8.      Compliance with 409A  .  The Company intends that this Award Agreement and the Plan either (a) comply with Section 409A and guidance thereunder or (b) be excepted from the provisions of Section 409A. Accordingly, the Company reserves the right and you agree that the Company shall have the right, without your consent and without prior notice to you, to amend either or both this Award Agreement and the Plan to cause this Award Agreement and the Plan to be so compliant or so excepted and to take such other actions under the Plan and this Award Agreement to achieve such compliance or exception. 
    
  9.      Certain Definitions.    Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings provided in the Plan. 
    
  10.      Designation of Beneficiary  .

To the extent that any provision of this Award Agreement conflicts with the expressly applicable terms of the Plan, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that those terms of the Plan shall control and, if necessary, the applicable provisions of this Award Agreement shall be hereby deemed amended so as to carry out the purpose and intent of the Plan. 
    
  2.      Restricted Stock Units.   
    
  (a)      Restricted Stock Units Award.    The Company hereby grants to you an aggregate of up to ____ restricted stock units (individually, an "RSU," and collectively, "RSUs") as more specifically set forth in Section 2(e).  Each RSU entitles you to receive one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Shares") at such time as the restrictions described in Section 2(d)(ii) lapse as described in Section 2(e).   
    
  (b)      Form of Restricted Stock; Possession of Certificates.    The Company shall issue the Shares you become entitled to receive hereunder by book-entry registration or by issuance of a certificate or certificates for the Shares in your name as soon as practicable after the restrictions in Section 2(d)(ii) lapse as described in Section 2(e).  In the event the Company issues a certificate or certificates for the Shares, such certificates shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the committee of the Board of Directors that administers the Plan may deem necessary or advisable under the Plan and rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which such Shares are then listed, and any applicable foreign, federal or state securities laws.   
    
  (c)      Stockholder Rights Prior to Issuance of Shares.    Neither you nor any of your beneficiaries shall be deemed to have any voting rights, rights to receive dividends or other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares covered by the RSUs until the date of book-entry registration or issuance by the Company of a certificate to you for such Shares.   
    
  (d)      Restrictions. 
    
  (i)    Your ownership of the RSUs shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection (ii) of this Section 2(d) until such restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of Section 2(e). 
    
  (ii)    The restrictions referred to in subsection (i) of this Section 2(d) are as follows: 
    
  (A)    At the time of your termination of employment with the Company or an Affiliate, other than a termination of employment that occurs as a result of an event described in Section 2(e)(ii) or 2(e)(iii), you shall forfeit the RSUs to the Company and all of your rights thereto shall terminate without any payment of consideration by the Company.   

(B)    You may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any RSUs or any rights under the RSUs.  No RSU and no rights under any such RSU may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  If you or anyone claiming under or through you attempts to violate this Section 2(d)(ii)(B), such attempted violation shall be null and void and without effect, and all of the Company's obligations hereunder shall terminate. 
    
  (e)      Lapse of Restrictions. 
    
  (i)      The restrictions described in Section 2(d)(ii) shall lapse with respect to the RSUs in four equal installments of 25 percent each on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of this Award Agreement, such that the restrictions set forth in Section 2(d)(ii) shall have lapsed with respect to 100 percent of the RSUs on the fourth anniversary of the date of this Award Agreement.   
    
  (ii)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) of this Section 2(e), the restrictions described in Section 2(d)(ii) shall lapse with respect to all RSUs upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 
    
  (A)    Your death or "  Disability  "; or 
    
  (B)    A Change of Control of the Company. 
           
  The term "  Disability  " shall mean your inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.   
    
  (iii)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) of this Section 2(e), upon the occurrence of your "  Retirement  ," the restrictions described in Section 2(d)(ii) shall lapse with respect to a number of RSUs determined as follows: (x) the total number of RSUs awarded to you hereunder multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of full and partial months elapsed from the date of the Award to the date of your Retirement, and the denominator of which is 48, minus (y) the total number of RSUs which previously lapsed under Subsection (i) of this Section 2(e). 
    
  The term "  Retirement  " shall mean your voluntary "  Separation from Service  " (as defined in Code Section 409A), on or after the date on which you attain age 65. 
    
  (iv)    On the date of the lapse of the restrictions in accordance with this Section 2(e), or in any event, no later than the earlier of ninety (90) days after such date or two and one half months following the end of the calendar year in which the restrictions lapsed in accordance with Section 2(e), the Company will make a book-entry registration or will issue you a certificate as provided in Section 2(b) of this Award Agreement for the Shares covered by such RSUs in redemption of such RSUs.   
            
  3.      Agreement with Respect to Taxes; Share Withholding  .   
    
  (a)    You agree that (1) you will pay to the Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, in cash, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company or such Affiliate regarding the payment of any taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by the Company or any of its Affiliates with respect to the RSUs and/or the Shares and (2) the Company or any of its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payments of any kind otherwise due to you any taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the RSUs and/or the Shares. 
    
  (b)    You agree that, if required by applicable law, you shall pay any taxes no later than the date as of which the value of the RSUs and/or Shares first become includible in your gross income for income tax purposes; provided, however, that the Committee may, in accordance with Article 16 of the Plan, permit you to:  (i) elect withholding by the Company of Shares otherwise deliverable to you pursuant to this Award Agreement (provided, however, that the amount of any Shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Company's or any Affiliate's required tax withholding of obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for Federal, state and/or local tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income or such other higher amount that will not cause adverse accounting consequences for the Company and is permitted under applicable withholding rules promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable governmental entity) and/or (ii) tender to the Company shares of Stock owned by you (or by you and your spouse jointly) and acquired more than six (6) months prior to such tender in  

full or partial satisfaction of such tax obligations, based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the payment date as determined by the Committee.    
    
  4.      Adjustment of Shares.    The number of Shares subject to the RSUs awarded to you under this Award Agreement may be adjusted as provided in the Plan.   
    
  5.      Agreement With Respect to Securities Matters.    You agree that you will not sell or otherwise transfer any Shares received pursuant to this Award Agreement except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration.  Unless a registration statement relating to the Shares issuable upon the lapse of the restrictions on the RSUs pursuant to this Award Agreement is in effect at the time of issuance of such Shares, the certificate(s) for the Shares shall contain the following legend:   
    
  The securities evidenced by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any other securities laws.  These securities have been acquired for investment and may not be sold or transferred for value in the absence of an effective registration of them under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and any other applicable securities laws, or receipt by the Company of an opinion of counsel or other evidence acceptable to the Company that such registration is not required under such acts.   
    
  6.      Certain Definitions.    Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings provided in the Plan. 
    
  7.      Compliance with 409A  .  The Company intends that this Award Agreement and the Plan either (1) comply with Code Section 409A and guidance thereunder or (b) be excepted from the provisions of Code Section 409A. Accordingly, the Company reserves the right and you agree that the Company shall have the right, without your consent and without prior notice to you, to amend either or both this Award Agreement and the Plan to cause this Award Agreement and the Plan to be so compliant or so excepted and to take such other actions under the Plan and this Award Agreement to achieve such compliance or exception. 
    
  8.      Forfeiture.    You agree that in the event you violate the confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation or non-disparagement provisions of any agreement between you and the Company or any Subsidiary, or any plan of the Company or any Affiliate in which you participate, including without limitation, the non-solicitation provisions of Section 9 below, all of your RSUs for which the restrictions have not previously lapsed in accordance with Section 2 shall be forfeited to the Company and all of your rights to receive any Shares in the future pursuant to the RSUs shall automatically terminate without any payment of consideration by the Company. 
    
  9.      Non-Solicitation  .   
    
  (a)      Non-Solicitation of Employees  .  During the period beginning on the date of this Award Agreement and ending on the second anniversary of the date of your termination of employment with the Company or an Affiliate, regardless of the reason for your termination of employment, you shall not, directly, or indirectly by assisting others: (i) cause or attempt to cause or encourage any employee of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate his or her relationship with the Company or an Affiliate or (ii) solicit the employment or engagement as a consultant or adviser, of any employee of the Company or an Affiliate or any former employee of the Company or an Affiliate who left the employ of the Company or Affiliate within two years following your termination of employment with the Company or an Affiliate. 
    
  (b)      Reasonableness of Restriction  .  You agree and acknowledge that the above non-solicitation covenant is reasonable in the scope of activities restricted, the geographic area covered by the restriction and the duration of the restriction, and is necessary in that it protects the legitimate business interests of the Company and its Affiliates in its confidential information, its proprietary work, and its relationships with its employees, customers, suppliers and agents and that it does not unreasonably impair your ability to earn a livelihood or to support your dependants. 
    
  (c)      Irreparable Harm; Injunctive Relief  .  You agree and acknowledge that a violation by you of the non-solicitation covenant contained herein will result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  You hereby agree that the Company will be entitled, in addition to any remedies it might have under this Award Agreement or at law, to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any threatened or actual breach of this Award Agreement by you, without the posting of bond or other security. 
    
  (d)      Extension of Covenant  .  During any breach of the non-solicitation provisions of this Award Agreement, the period of restraint set forth herein shall be automatically tolled and suspended for the amount of time that the violation continues. 

(e)      Survival of Covenants  .  Your obligations pursuant to this Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Award Agreement and the termination of your employment with the Company or an Affiliate. 
    
  (f)      Attorneys' Fees  .  You agree to pay the Company any attorneys' fees and costs which the Company incurs in enforcing, to any extent, the provisions of this Section 9, whether or not litigation is actually commenced, and including any appeal. 
    
  10.      Designation of Beneficiary.     Your beneficiary for receipt of any payment made under this Award Agreement in the event of your death shall be the person(s) designated as your beneficiary(ies) on a form prescribed by the Company.  If no beneficiary is designated, upon your death, payment shall be made to your estate.
