NOTE 1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Basis of Presentation

Southern Concepts Restaurant Group, Inc. ("SCRG"), a Colorado corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively the "Company") develops and operates full-service restaurants and a fast casual restaurant.  SCRG was formed on January 29, 2008.  The Company, on March 9, 2015, with the approval of a majority of the Company's shareholders, changed its name from Bourbon Brothers Holding Corporation to Southern Concepts Restaurant Group, Inc.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company operates three of its Southern Hospitality branded restaurants in Denver, Lone Tree and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Company has developed a fast casual concept, in which the Company opened its first fast casual restaurant, Carve Barbecue, in November 2015.

The Company operates and manages restaurants through its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, including:

SH Franchisee   Licensing Corp. ("SH")

Southern Hospitality Denver Holdings, LLC ("SHDH")

Southern Hospitality Denver, LLC ("SHD")

Southern Hospitality Lone Tree, LLC ("SHLT")

Carve Restaurant Group, LLC ("CRG")

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial statements and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and results of operations. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for annual reports. This quarterly report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Management's Plans

During 2016, the Company continues to explore options for growth for the Company's two brands, Southern Hospitality and Carve Barbecue, and scouting locations for the kitchen-less concept it is looking to open in Q1 2017.  The Company is looking for opportunities for the Southern Hospitality concept with a footprint of 4,000 to 5,000 square feet.  The Company is identifying real estate partners and locations for Carve Barbecue's approximately 2,500 square feet footprint. The Company is in the process of identifying 500 to 1,000 square ft. locations for the kitchen-less concept development in the first and second quarters of 2017.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had incurred losses in the first three quarters of 2016. The Company's continued implementation of its business plan is dependent on its future profitability and on additional debt or equity financing. The Company believes the individual store performances reflect an ongoing effort to curb costs within food and labor, while also pursuing marketing activities to increase revenues during the remainder of 2016 at all restaurant locations while also curtailing expenses at the corporate level.

The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company reported a net loss of approximately $0.9 million, $2.8 million, $1.0 million and $2.9 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $14.5 million at September 30, 2016. The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accountin g, which simplifies many aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions under ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liability, forfeiture rate calculations and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ("ASU 2016-02"),  Leases (Topic 842) , which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in  "Leases (Topic 840)"  and generally requires all leases to be recognized in the statement of financial position. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will have on the consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Inventory (Topic 330) Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  , which changes the measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. The guidance requires prospective application for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and permits adoption in an earlier period. The Company intends to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of 2017; the adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The provisions of this ASU are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this ASU will have on the consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts from Customers , which supersedes the revenue recognition in Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of potential goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date by one year. This new standard is now effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and is to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption  now permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating this new standard and the potential impact this standard may have upon adoption.

Management has not identified any other recently issued accounting standards that it believes may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

Inventory

Inventory consists of food and beverages and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.

NOTE 3   INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets at September 30, 2016, represent franchise license costs for the Denver restaurant (net of accumulated amortization of $18,125). Amortization expenses of $1,250 and $3,750 have been recorded for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense for the next five years and thereafter is estimated to be as follows:

Overview 

During 2016, the Company continues to explore options for growth for the Company's two brands, Southern Hospitality and Carve Barbecue, and scouting locations for the kitchen-less concept it is looking to open in Q1 2017.  The Company is looking for opportunities for the Southern Hospitality concept with a footprint of 4,000 to 5,000 square feet.  The Company is identifying real estate partners and locations for Carve Barbecue's approximately 2,500 square feet footprint. The Company is in the process of identifying 500 to 1,000 square ft. locations for the kitchen-less concept development in the first and second quarters of 2017.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had incurred losses in the first three quarters of 2016. The Company's continued implementation of its business plan is dependent on its future profitability and on additional debt or equity financing. The Company believes the individual store performances reflect an ongoing effort to curb costs within food and labor, while also pursuing marketing activities to increase revenues during the remainder of 2016 at all restaurant locations while also curtailing expenses at the corporate level.

Results of Operations   Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

Revenues

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company generated approximately $1,709,000, $5,570,000, $1,737,000 and $4,793,000 respectively, in net revenue.  The primary increase in 2016 over 2015 was due to the additional store openings of SHLT and CARVEG which increased 2016 revenues compared to the same period in 2015.

Operating Expenses   Restaurant Operating Costs

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company's restaurant operating costs were approximately $1,839,000, $5,794,000, $1,771,000 and $4,857,000, respectively.  The restaurant operating costs was attributable to the four operating restaurants, including the cost of food, alcohol, labor and other costs of the restaurants.

Cost of revenue, comprised of operating expenses at the SHD, SHSK, SHLT and CARVEG restaurants, includes variable expenses that fluctuate with sales volumes for expenses such as food and beverage costs, payroll and franchise fees.  Fixed expenses, such as lease expenses at the restaurant locations, are also included.  The Company is working diligently to align food and beverage costs and payroll margins with industry best practices, while also pursuing marketing activities to increase revenues and streamlining restaurant expenses during the remainder of 2016 at all restaurant locations.

11 

Operating Expenses   General and Administrative and Selling and Marketing

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company's operating expenses were approximately $383,100, $1,422,600, $593,500 and $1,834,100. The operating expenses in 2016 were primarily related to ongoing operations while 2015 included pre-opening expenses for SHLT and CARVEG. The Company's largest operating expense, excluding restaurant operating expenses, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were its general and administrative expenses totaling approximately $310,500, $1,209,200, $495,400 and $1,589,900. The general and administrative costs are due to ongoing expenses for four restaurant locations primarily, including recurring corporate costs (such as payroll and related expenses).  As part of operating expenses, the Company incurred approximately $72,600, $213,500, $98,000 and $244,300 in selling and marketing expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company expects to incur general and administrative expenses going forward as it continues to grow its operations.  The Company anticipates that its consolidated net loss may continue throughout the remainder of 2016 due to the pursuing of marketing activities to increase revenues and to fund its corporate overhead.

Operating Expenses   Depreciation and Amortization

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company's depreciation and amortization was approximately $187,500, $566,300, $152,900 and $405,100.  Depreciation on fixed assets and amortization of the intangible asset for franchise fees began in February 2013 with the opening of the SH Denver restaurant, the Company's first restaurant.

Other income (expense)

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized other expense of approximately $188,000, $557,000, $178,000 and $554,000 consisting of interest expense.  The increase in interest expense comparing year over year was primarily due to the increase in the amount of promissory notes in 2016 compared to 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $1,813,300 and had approximately $65,000 of cash.  The Company's total assets decreased as of September 30, 2016, when compared to December 31, 2015, mostly due to cash used to prepay a portion of the related party note payable and to fund an increase in property and equipment for CARVEG. 

As noted above, the Company incurred a net loss during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Further, as of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $14,509,100.  The Company believes its restaurant revenues from its four restaurants in Denver, Colorado Springs, Lone Tree and Glendale, offset by the overhead of the public company administration, requires the Company to seek additional capital to help fund its operations in the near term.  However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the Company on reasonable terms, if at all.  The Company's ability to continue to pursue its plan of operations is dependent upon its ability to increase revenues and/or raise the capital necessary to meet its financial requirements on a continuing basis. The Company's continued implementation of its business plan is dependent on its future profitability and on additional debt or equity financing, which may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.  If such profitability and/or financing are not available, the Company may need to curtail its operations.  The Company believes the individual store performances reflect an ongoing effort to curb costs within food and labor, while also pursuing marketing activities to increase revenues and streamlining restaurant expenses during the remainder of 2016 at all restaurant locations.

The Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Report of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, includes a "going concern" explanatory paragraph which means that the auditors stated that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Liabilities

The Company's liabilities for notes payable and accrued interest as of September 30, 2016, is approximately $2,932,900 compared to approximately $2,506,600 as of December 31, 2015.  Accounts payable as of September 30, 2016, is approximately $155,000 compared to approximately $256,000 as of December 31, 2015.  Overall, total liabilities increased due to the accrued interest on the notes payables.

Operating Activities

Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $1,576,800 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately $1,944,000 in the same period of 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities in 2016 (compared to 2015) was primarily due to the increase in net loss offset by decreases in accounts payable. 

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $55,700, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately $1,604,200 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was primarily the result of cash used for purchases of property and equipment for both periods, including purchases related to new store openings in 2015. 

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $591,000, compared to net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of approximately $2,915,300.  Cash used in financing activities in 2016 primarily consisted of payments on long-term debt and related party promissory notes, offset by proceeds from the sale of common stock. 

Contractual Cash Obligations

In April 2012, the Company entered into a lease with a third party that expires in August 2022, with the option to extend for two, five year periods, and requires lease payments of approximately $15,550 per month for the first year, escalating up to approximately $20,289 per month in the tenth year.

In January 2014, the Company entered into a lease with a third party for its corporate office. The Company pays approximately $6,000 per month with the lease expiring on December 31, 2016.

In January 2014, the Company entered into a 120 month lease with a related party for its Colorado Springs-based restaurant. The Company pays $33,424 per month escalating by approximately 10% every 60 months.

In July 2014, the Company entered into a ten-year, non-cancellable lease with a third party for the restaurant in Lone Tree, Colorado. The lease provides for an initial lease term of ten years with two, five year renewal options. Rent payments are approximately $9,900 per month plus certain common area maintenance charges, and are subject to escalation provisions. This location opened April 27, 2015.

In April 2015, the Company entered into a non-cancellable lease with a third party for the Company's first fast casual restaurant in Glendale, Colorado. The initial term of this lease is to expire July 31, 2020.  This lease includes three extension options, with the term of each extension option consisting of five years. Rent payments are approximately $11,000. This location opened November 5, 2015.

Not applicable.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"), as of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.  A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual consolidated financial statements or interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the most recent fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1A.  RISK FACTORS
