     Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements   

   (Unaudited)   

Note
1. General Organization and Business   

VinCompass
Corp. (Formerly known as Tiger Jiujiang Mining, Inc.), entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with VinCompass, whereby VinCompass
Corp. exchanged 60.0% of its outstanding shares of common stock for 100% of the outstanding shares of VinCompass common stock.
As of January 14, 2016 (the  Closing Date ), VinCompass will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of VinCompass Corp.  

As
of January 14, 2016, VinCompass Corp had 400,000,000 and 2,000,000 shares of common stock and preferred stock authorized, respectively,
of which 17,500,000 and 1,000,000 were issued and outstanding, respectively. As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, each
outstanding share of VinCompass common stock was transferred, conveyed and delivered to VinCompass Corp. in exchange for 26,000,000
newly-issued shares of common stock of VinCompass Corp. The 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock were held by VinCompass management
as of closing date.  

The
Merger will be accounted for as a  reverse merger  and recapitalization since, immediately following the completion
of the transaction, the holders of VinCompass s stock will have effective control of VinCompass Corp. In addition, VinCompass
will have control of the combined entity through control of the Board by designating all board seats to be held by the existing
board of VinCompass Corp. Additionally, all of VinCompass s officers and senior executive positions will continue on as
management of the combined entity after consummation of the Merger. For accounting purposes, VinCompass will be deemed to be the
accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction will be treated as a recapitalization of VinCompass
Corp. Accordingly, VinCompass assets, liabilities and results of operations will become the historical financial statements of
the registrant, and VinCompass s assets, liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with VinCompass Corp
effective as of the date of the closing of the Merger. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill will be recorded in
this transaction. VinCompass received $2,202 cash and assumed $114,327 liabilities upon execution of the reverse merger.  

On
December 14, 2015, FINRA approved the Corporate Name Change, Symbol Change, and the Forward Split took effect on December 15,
2015 for Tiger Jiujiang Mining Corp. The Forward Split shares are payable upon surrender of certificates to the Company s
transfer agent. Accordingly, the Company s symbol has been changed to TIGYD to reflect the Forward Split and Symbol
Change and twenty (20) business days thereafter, the  D  has been removed and the symbol has been changed
to VCPS.  

Note
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Basis
of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements of Vincompass Corp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with
the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Form 10-K filed with SEC. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position
and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which
would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2016 as reported on Form
10-K have been omitted. 

Embedded
Conversion Features   

The
Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging  to
determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative
at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment
under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20  Debt with Conversion and Other Options  for consideration
of any beneficial conversion features.  

Note
3. Going Concern   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates,
among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

The
Company had accumulated deficits of $2,422,912 at August 31, 2016 and $2,056,125 at February 29, 2016. It had net losses of $211,727
for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and a net loss of $96,807 for the equivalent quarter ended August 31, 2015. It had
net losses of $366,787 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 and a net loss of $226,114 for the equivalent quarter ended August
31, 2015. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

While
the Company is attempting to increase operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant
enough to support the Company s daily operations. The Company will continue to pursue additional equity and/or debt financing
while managing cash flows from operations in an effort to provide funds to meet its obligations on a timely basis and to support
future business development. There is no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Management believes that the actions
presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate additional revenues provide the opportunity for the
Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate additional revenues
and in its ability to raise the additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plans and generate additional
revenues.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may result
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Note
4. Common Stock    

During the quarter ended August 31, 2016,
the Company allocated 77,921 shares, to be issued in lieu of fees paid to third parties. The fair value of the shares is determined
to be $85,760 using $1.03 and $1.25 per share, which represent the market price at August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016,
respectively. In addition third party shareholders subscribed for 99,375 shares, for which they paid $0.80 per share,
at total of $79,500 as of August 31, 2016 the date such issues were approved by the board. 

Note
5. Related Party Transactions   

As
of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016, the amounts due to the majority shareholder and a director bear no interest and have
no stated repayment terms. The Company recorded no imputed interest on these borrowings. These loans arose from payments
made on behalf of the Company, including by private credit cards and was advanced as follows:  

Note
6. Convertible notes.   

As
of July 7, 2016, the Company executed a convertible promissory note for $30,000, net of $3,500 original issuance discount.
The Note bears an interest rate of 10% per annum and is due July 7, 2017. A further convertible promissory note for $30,000,
net of $3,500 original issuance discount, was issued on August 15, 2016, which bears an interest rate of 10% per annum and
is due August 15, 2017. These notes become convertible six months after the dates of agreement at a conversion price that equals
58% of the average of the lowest 3 Trading Prices for the Common Stock during the 20 Trading Day prior to such Conversion Date.  

Note
7. Subsequent Events.   

On
October 5, 2016, the Company executed a convertible Promissory note for $73,500.00. The note bears an interest rate of 10% per
annum and is due on September 28, 2017.

ITEM 2.   
       MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

The following Management s Discussion
and Analysis should be read in conjunction with VinCompass Corp. financial statements and the related notes thereto. The Management s
Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans,
objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements.
When used, the words  believe,   plan,   intend,   anticipate,   target, 
 estimate,   expect,  and the like, and/or future-tense or conditional constructions ( will, 
 may,   could,   should,  etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this Report on Form 10-Q. The Company s
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of several factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events
or circumstances occurring after the date of this Report on Form 10-Q.  

As used in this quarterly report, the terms
 we ,  us ,  our , and  Company  shall mean  VinCompass  where events
are referenced.  

Our financial statements are stated in United
States Dollars ( USD  or  US$  or  $ ) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles. All references to  common shares  refer to the common shares in our capital stock.  

THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF
OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING MAY 31, 2016, SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CORPORATION S
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE NOTES THERETO CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q AND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT FILED ON FORM
10-K ON MAY 20, 2016.  

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following
discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially
from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but
are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in the section entitled  Risk
Factors . 

We are a development stage company and have
not generated material revenue to date. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared
assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and
realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

As a result of Closing the Share Exchange Agreement
as filed with the Commission on November 25, 2015 in the Company s current report on Form 8-K, the registrant is no longer
a shell corporation as that term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act and Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

We were incorporated in the State of Wyoming
on January 20, 2010, as Tiger Jiujiang Mining, Inc. and established a fiscal year end of February 28. Our statutory registered
agent s office is located at 1620 Central Avenue, Suite 202, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82001 and our business office is located at
795 Folsom Street, 1 st  Floor, San Francisco, CA. Our telephone number is 415-817-9955. 

On November 22, 2015, the Company, then under
the name Tiger Jiujiang Mining, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (the  Company ) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement
(the  Share Exchange Agreement ) with VinCompass Corp., a California corporation ( VinCompass ), the shareholders
of VinCompass (the  VinCompass Shareholders ), and the controlling stockholders of the Company (by unanimous vote)
(the  Tiger Controlling Stockholders ). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 5,200,000 (100%)
shares of common stock of VinCompass from the VinCompass Shareholders (the  VinCompass Shares ) and in exchange issued
26,000,000 (59.77%) restricted shares of its common stock to the VinCompass Shareholders (the  Tiger Shares ). As a
result of the Share Exchange Agreement, VinCompass became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company upon closing and the Company
now carries on the business of VinCompass as its primary business. The Share Exchange Agreement contains customary representations,
warranties and conditions to closing. The closing of the Share Exchange Agreement (the  Closing ) occurred on January
14, 2016 (the  Closing Date ). 

As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement: 

(a)        each
outstanding VinCompass Share was cancelled, extinguished and converted into and became the right to receive a pro rata portion
of the Tiger Shares which equaled the number of VinCompass Shares held by each VinCompass Shareholder multiplied by the exchange
ratio of 5(the  Exchange Ratio ). Based on the Exchange Ratio, as a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, the VinCompass
Shareholders own a total of 26,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of the Company; and 

(b)        Pursuant
to the Share Exchange Agreement, Ya-Ping irrevocably canceled a total of 25,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of the Company. 

As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement,
the VinCompass Shareholders own a total of 26,000,000 restricted shares of the Company, which represents 59.77% of our issued and
outstanding shares of common stock. The Share Exchange Agreement is being accounted for as a  reverse acquisition, 
as the VinCompass Shareholders own a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company s capital stock immediately following
the Closing of the Share Exchange Agreement. Accordingly, VinCompass is deemed to be the acquirer in the reverse acquisition. After
the Closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Board of Directors and management of the Company are comprised of VinCompass s
management team and the operations of VinCompass are the continuing operations of the Company. 

BUSINESS  

VinCompass  is an eCommerce platform
built on patent pending technology that takes the guess work out of the wine buying equation for the consumer. We have multiple
revenue streams focused on providing curated wine through our wine club, direct purchases via our App and private label wines with
the majority of the revenue realized as recurring wine subscriptions. Our intelligent software platform determines an individual s
VinPrint  (wine DNA preference) so consumers can purchase wine that meets their profile with alluring value and availability. 

Our Proposed Exploration Program  
Plan of Operation   Results of Operations   

Wine buying is a daunting task and for the
average consumer, there has been no means to easily select wines to enjoy and cellar that matches preferences for taste and price.
To help fill this void, a plethora of wine clubs have popped up on the internet which have failed to address this problem. The
clubs push wine that provide them with the greatest margin rather than address the needs of the consumer. As a result the membership
renewals and reorder rates are well below those of other consumer product based clubs. 

The solution is VinCompass  .
a full-service personalized wine curator and eCommerce platform. Our wine club will provide members only wines that meet their
individual VinPrint  and at price levels determined by the consumer, providing enhanced membership renewals and reorder rates. 

The Opportunity  

Unlike the numerous .com wine sites and Apps
that target retail wine enthusiasts looking to purchase wine, VinCompass  addresses the unmet need to uniquely pair taste
and budget. With mobile devices now enabling 100 s of millions of consumers to instantly fulfill their interests in music,
sports, news and reading, VinCompass  is poised to become the mobile app-enabled cloud service for consumers to discover,
archive, socialize and acquire curated wines thus creating new opportunities to monetize the fast growing $1B$+/month e-wine marketplace. 

For vineyards, it can be difficult and expensive
to reach would-be customers. Unlike wine superstores who fail to connect boutique growers with the palate of discriminating drinkers,
VinCompass  employs a unique, patent-pending  VinPrint   to create a digital blue print of an individual s 
wine preferences and then match those preferences with an inventory of more than 1 million wines and the wine lists of more than
10,000 restaurants. VinCompass  creates a personalized one-to-one relationship with life-long customers that growers otherwise
would not otherwise be able to establish and cultivate to scale. 

For wine lovers, the rise of such unprecedented
access may result in too many choices; Restaurant lists can seem like a set of encyclopedias with too many different value options.
Regardless of wine knowledge, choosing wine can be intimidating or time consuming. The VinCompass  mobile app quickly presents
a list of nearby restaurants, whose wine lists they can peruse before even walking in the door. Before the sommelier hands over
the wine list, VinCompass  will help select the ideal bottle based on wine tastes, budget and food preferences. 

Our Brand and Products

and Google Play 

 Web Site   eComm portal for Wine 

Business Model  

Both recurring and on-demand revenue in Wine

Recurring revenue generated from wine club   freemium subscriptions (akin to Amazon s Prime)    

On-demand revenue generated from Virtual Vineyard, Private Label, Individually Branded, and Charity wines.

Invitation Only Model    We employ
a complete Social graph network and full attribution for all members. Social as Members can invite other members to join and drive
the social aspect. 

Social Media Partnerships - We will service
communities that have high affinity to wine consumers. These Partnerships get the advantage of providing significant benefit s
to their community that is not generally available. The members of VinCompass generally save about 16% on wine spend and yet enjoy
wine more by 14% on average thanks to the Patent Pending Recommendation Engine. As well as ultimately enjoying a curated wine via
eComm for consumption outside of the Restaurants.

31, 2015. The costs can be subdivided into the following categories which have and will vary from quarter to quarter based on
the level of corporate activity and capital raising. 

There was no Gross revenue for the six months ended August
31, 2016 and 2015. 

GENERAL   ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES: $150,374
f or the three months ended August 31, 2016, while $66,512
was spent in the same period ended August 31, 2015. For the six months $234,661 was expended in total on general   administrative
expenses, while $161,990 was spent in the same period ended August 31, 2015. Included under general   administrative there
are the Development Expenses: which include consulting, design fees, salaries, and sundry development fees being $96,859 for the
three months ended August 31, 2016 ($51,175 for same period in 2015) and $133,085 for the six months ended August 31, 2016 (with
$111,305 spent in the same six month comparative period in 2015).  

SALES   MARKETING EXPENSES: $61,353 was
expended on the promotion of the Company s products for future sales matters for the six months ended August 31, 2016, while
$30,295 was spent in the same three period ended August 31, 2015. For the six months ended August 31, 2016 a total of $132,126
was spent compared with $64,124 in the same six month period in 2015. 

Plan of Operation   

As of August 31, 2016 and February 29, 2016,
we had a deficit of $538,372 and $336,845 in working capital. 

Over the balance of the current fiscal year
we intend to seek financing for the ongoing development of the VinCompass business plan and to further develop our business model.
We will need to raise sufficient additional capital for the work plus for our administrative operations and working capital through
the sale of equity shares in the form of a private placement or public offering, loans or advances from officers or directors or
others or convertible debentures. 

We do not expect any changes or hiring of employees
since contracts are given to consultants and sub-contractor specialists in specific fields of expertise. We do not expect to purchase
or sell any plant or significant equipment. We intend to lease or rent any equipment that we will need in order to carry out our
business plan development. 

Presently, we have not generated any
revenues to meet operating and capital expenses. We have incurred operating losses since inception, and this is likely to continue
through fiscal 2016-2017. Management projects that we will require a total of up to $750,000 to fund ongoing operating expenses
and working capital requirements for the next twelve months. 

Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet
our current operating and capital expenses, in their report on the annual financial statements for the year ended February 28,
2016, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our former
independent auditors. Our issuance of additional equity securities could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests
of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities
and future cash commitments. 

There are no assurances that we will be able
to obtain further funds required for continued long term operations. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain
the additional financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our obligations as they become due. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

As of end of the last quarter on August 31,
2016, we have yet to generate any revenues from operations. 

As of August 31, 2016, our total assets, consisting
entirely of cash, amounted to $28,674 while total current liabilities were $567,046. Our working capital deficit was $538,372 as
of August 31, 2016. 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities   

During the six-month period ended August 31,
2016, $195,689 in cash was used for operating activities as compared to $78,351 used in the six- months ended August 31, 2015. 

Cash
Flow from Investing Activities    

During
the six months ended August 31, 2015, there was $25,000 proceeds collected from subscription receivable.  

Cash Flow from Financing Activities   

During the six-month periods ended August 31,
2016 and 2015, the Company had $180,683 and $Nil respectively, in cash provided by financing activities. 

Other   

During the quarter ended August 31, 2016,
the Company allocated 77,921 shares, to be issued in lieu of fees paid to third parties. The fair value of the shares is determined
to be $85,760 using $1.03 and $1.05 per share, which represent the market price at August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016,
respectively. In addition third party shareholders subscribed for 99,375 shares, still to be issued, for which they paid $0.80
per share- at total of $79,500 as of August 31, 2016 the date such issues were approved by the board. 

Inflation / Currency Fluctuations   

Inflation has not been a factor during
the recent quarter ended August 31, 2016. Although inflation is moderately higher than it was during 2014 - 2015, the
actual rate of inflation is not material and is not considered a factor in our contemplated capital expenditure program. 

ITEM 3.   
       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4.   
       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

(a)       Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures.  

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based
upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will
prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, have been detected. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present
in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

(b)       Changes in Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting.  

Our management has also evaluated our internal
control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation. 

The Company is not required by current SEC
rules to include, and does not include, an auditor s attestation report. The Company s registered public accounting
firm has not attested to Management s reports on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER
INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.   
       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS    

From time to time, the Company may become subject
to various legal proceedings that are incidental to the ordinary conduct of its business. Although the Company cannot accurately
predict the amount of any liability that may ultimately arise with respect to any of these matters, it makes provision for potential
liabilities when it deems them probable and reasonably estimable. These provisions are based on current information and legal advice
and may be adjusted from time to time according to developments. 

The Corporation is and has not been party to
any legal proceedings in the quarter under review and we know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our
Company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which
any director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest
adverse to our interest. 

ITEM 1A.   
       RISK FACTORS    

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this
item. 

ITEM 2.   
       UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS    

During the six months ended August 31, 2016:  

During the quarter ended August 31, 2016,
the Company allocated 77,432 shares, to be issued in lieu of fees paid to third parties. The fair value of the shares is determined
to be $85,760 using $1.03 and $1.25 per share, which represent the market price at August 31, 2016 and May 31,
2016. In addition third party shareholders subscribed for 99,375 shares, for which they paid $0.80 per share, at
total of $79,500 as at August 31, 2016 the date such issues were approved by the board. 

Subsequent to the three months ended August 31, 2016:  

On October 5, 2016, the Company executed a
convertible Promissory note for $73,500.00. The note bears an interest rate of 10% per annum and is due on September 28,
2017.
