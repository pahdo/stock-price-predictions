    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
       
  The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ("Farmer Mac") and subsidiaries have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows of Farmer Mac and subsidiaries for the interim periods presented.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements have been omitted as permitted by SEC rules and regulations.  The December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet presented in this report has been derived from Farmer Mac's audited 2015 consolidated financial statements.  Management believes that the disclosures are adequate to present fairly the consolidated financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented.  These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Farmer Mac and subsidiaries included in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016.  That Form 10-K describes Farmer Mac's significant accounting policies, which include its policies on Principles of Consolidation; Cash and Cash Equivalents and Statements of Cash Flows; Transfers of Financial Assets and Liabilities; Investment Securities, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, and USDA Securities; Loans; Securitization of Loans; Real Estate Owned; Financial Derivatives; Notes Payable; Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Losses; Earnings Per Common Share; Income Taxes; Stock-Based Compensation; Comprehensive Income; Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments; Fair Value Measurement; and Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs").  Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those that may be expected for the fiscal year.  Presented below are Farmer Mac's significant accounting policies that contain updated information for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Farmer Mac and its   three   subsidiaries: (1) Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation ("FMMSC"), whose principal activities are to facilitate the purchase and issuance of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities; (2) Farmer Mac II LLC, whose principal activity is the operation of substantially all of the business related to the USDA Guarantees line of business   primarily the acquisition of USDA Securities; and (3) Contour Valuation Services, LLC (which began doing business as AgVisory during first quarter 2016), whose principal activity is to appraise agricultural real estate.  The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of VIEs in which Farmer Mac determined itself to be the primary beneficiary.

    Earnings Per Common Share 
       
  Basic earnings per common share ("EPS") is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding.  Diluted earnings per common share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted to include all potentially dilutive common stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), and non-vested restricted stock awards.  The following schedule reconciles basic and diluted EPS for three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 
    
  Table 1.3 

(1)   
    For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, stock options and SARs of   54,709   and   476,699  , respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because they were anti-dilutive. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, contingent shares of non-vested restricted stock of   37,284   and   45,034  , respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because performance conditions had not yet been met. 

(1)   
    For   the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, stock options and SARs of   115,875   and   302,598  , respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because they were anti-dilutive. For   the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, contingent shares of non-vested restricted stock of   37,284   and   40,194  , respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share of common stock because performance conditions had not yet been met. 

(c) 
    Comprehensive Income 
       
  Comprehensive income represents all changes in stockholders' equity except those resulting from investments by or distributions to stockholders, and is comprised of net income and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, certain held-to-maturity securities transferred from the available-for-sale classification, and cash flow hedges, net of related taxes.

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), net of tax, by component for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 
    
  Table 1.4

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents other comprehensive income activity, the impact on net income of amounts reclassified from each component of AOCI, and the related tax impact for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

               (3)   
    Represents amortization of deferred gains related to certain available-for-sale USDA Securities and Farmer Mac Guaranteed USDA Securities. 
               (4)   
    Relates to the amortization of unrealized gains or losses prior to the reclassification of these securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.  The amortization of unrealized gains or losses reported in AOCI for held-to-maturity securities will be offset by the amortization of the premium or discount created from the transfer into held-to-maturity securities, which occurred at fair value.  These unrealized gains or losses will be recorded over the remaining life of the security with no impact on future net income. 
               (5)   
    Relates to the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges recorded in AOCI.

(d) New Accounting Standards 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01,   "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,"   which amends the guidance in GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.  The ASU significantly revises an entity's accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.  The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  Farmer Mac does not expect that adoption of the new guidance will have a material effect on Farmer Mac s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   "Leases,"   which provides new guidance intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions.  The ASU will require organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.  The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  Farmer Mac does not expect that adoption of the new guidance will have a material effect on Farmer Mac s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,    which provides new guidance intended to simplify several aspects of accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Farmer Mac does not expect that adoption of the new guidance will have a material effect on Farmer Mac s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "  Financial Instruments Credit Losses,"   which will require entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Entities will be required to use forward-looking information to form their credit loss estimates.  The ASU will also require enhanced disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity s portfolio.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.   Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  Farmer Mac is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force),"   which amends the existing guidance to add or clarify current guidance in GAAP on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Farmer Mac does not expect that adoption of the new guidance will have a material effect on Farmer Mac's statement of cash flows.

The unrealized losses presented above are principally due to a general widening of credit spreads from the dates of acquisition to   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, as applicable.  The resulting decrease in fair values reflects an increase in the perceived risk by the financial markets related to those securities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of the investment securities in an unrealized loss position either were backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government or had credit ratings of at least "AA+," except   one   that was rated "A-."  As of   December 31, 2015  , all of the investment securities in an unrealized loss

position either were backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government or had credit ratings of at least "  AA+  ," except   three   that were rated "  A-  ."  The unrealized losses were on   77   and   69   individual investment securities as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   27   of the securities in loss positions had been in loss positions for more than 12 months and had a total unrealized loss of   $7.9 million  .  As of   December 31, 2015  ,   17   of the securities in loss positions had been in loss positions for more than 12 months and had a total unrealized loss of   $6.6 million  .  Securities in unrealized loss positions for 12 months or longer have a fair value as of   September 30, 2016   that is, on average, approximately   98 percent   of their amortized cost basis.  Farmer Mac believes that all of these unrealized losses are recoverable within a reasonable period of time by way of maturity or changes in credit spreads.  Accordingly, Farmer Mac has concluded that none of the unrealized losses on these available-for-sale investment securities represents other-than-temporary impairment as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  
    
  Farmer Mac did not own any held-to-maturity investment securities as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac did not own any trading investment securities.  As of   December 31, 2015  , Farmer Mac owned trading investment securities with an amortized cost of   $2.2 million  , a fair value of   $0.5 million  , and a weighted average yield of   4.41 percent  . 
    
  The amortized cost, fair value, and weighted average yield of available-for-sale investment securities by remaining contractual maturity as of   September 30, 2016   are set forth below.  Asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are included based on their final maturities, although the actual maturities may differ due to prepayments of the underlying assets.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, unrealized losses on held-to-maturity and available-for-sale on-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and USDA Securities were as follows: 
    
  Table 3.2 

The unrealized losses presented above are principally due to higher interest rates from the date of acquisition to   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, as applicable.  The credit exposure related to Farmer Mac's USDA Guarantees line of business is covered by the full faith and credit guarantee of the United States.  The unrealized losses from AgVantage securities were on   25   available-for-sale securities as of   September 30, 2016  .  There were   four   held-to-maturity AgVantage securities with an unrealized loss as of   September 30, 2016  .  The unrealized losses from AgVantage securities were on   22   available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2015.  There were   no   unrealized losses from held-to-maturity securities as of   December 31, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   17   available-for-sale AgVantage securities had been in a loss position for more than 12 months with a total unrealized loss of   $58.1 million  .    As of December 31, 2015  ,   8   available-for-sale AgVantage securities had been in a loss position for more than 12 months with a total unrealized loss of   $28.7 million  .  Farmer Mac has concluded that none of the unrealized losses on its held-to-maturity Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and available-for-sale Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and USDA Securities are other-than-temporary impairment as of either   September 30, 2016   or December 31, 2015.  Farmer Mac does not intend to sell these securities, and it is not more likely than not that Farmer Mac will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis.

As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac owned trading USDA Securities with an amortized cost of   $23.4 million  , a fair value of   $23.5 million  , and a weighted average yield of   5.48 percent  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , Farmer Mac owned trading USDA Securities with an amortized cost of   $29.1 million  , a fair value of   $29.0 million  , and a weighted average yield of   5.53 percent  .

    FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES 
       
  Farmer Mac enters into financial derivative transactions principally to protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets, future cash flows, or debt issuance, and not for trading or speculative purposes.  Certain financial derivatives are designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate assets, primarily classified as available-for-sale, to protect against fair value changes in the assets related to a benchmark interest rate (i.e., LIBOR). Other financial derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate the volatility of future interest rate payments on floating rate debt. 
    
  All financial derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as a freestanding asset or liability. Changes in the fair values of financial derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges are reported in  

22 

     Table of Contents  

"  (Losses)/gains on financial derivatives and hedging activities  " in the   consolidated statements of operations  .  For financial derivatives designated in fair value hedging relationships, changes in the fair values of the hedged items, which are primarily fixed rate AgVantage securities, related to the risk being hedged are also reported in "  (Losses)/gains on financial derivatives and hedging activities  " in the   consolidated statements of operations  .  Interest accruals on derivatives designated in fair value hedging relationships are recorded in "  Net interest income  " in the consolidated statements of operations.  For the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the amount of interest expense recognized on those derivatives was   $4.0 million   and   $12.9 million  , respectively.  For the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the amount of interest expense recognized on those derivatives was   $5.7 million   and   $16.8 million  , respectively. For financial derivatives designated in cash flow hedging relationships, the effective portion of the derivative gain/loss is recorded in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in "  (Losses)/gains on financial derivatives and hedging activities  " in the   consolidated statements of operations  .  Because the hedging instrument is an interest rate swap and the hedged forecasted transactions are future interest payments on variable-rate debt, amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified to "  Total interest expense  " in conjunction with the recognition of interest expense on the debt.  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.5 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively, was reclassified out of other comprehensive income into interest expense. For for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   $0.4 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively, was reclassified out of other comprehensive income into interest expense.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac expects to reclassify   $1.9 million   pretax, or   $1.2 million   after-tax, from accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to earnings over the next twelve months.  This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to   September 30, 2016  .  During the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   no   gains or losses from interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges reclassified to earnings because it became probable the original forecasted transaction would not occur.

The following tables summarize information related to Farmer Mac's financial derivatives on a gross basis without giving consideration to master netting arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015   and the effects of financial derivatives on the   consolidated statements of operations   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

    Included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness as of   September 30, 2016  , but excluded from the amounts in the table, were losses of   $1.0 million   and   $4.2 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , attributable to the fair value of the swaps at the inception of the hedging relationship.  Accordingly, the amounts recognized as hedge ineffectiveness for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were losses of   $0.2 million   and gains of   $1.5 million  , respectively.  The comparable amounts as of   September 30, 2015   were losses of $  2.9 million   and   $8.6 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , attributable to the fair value of the swaps at the inception of the hedging relationship and, accordingly, gains of $  0.3 million   and   $0.4 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , attributable to hedge ineffectiveness.

As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac's credit exposure to interest rate swap counterparties, excluding netting arrangements and any adjustment for nonperformance risk, but including accrued interest, was   $12.1 million   and   $6.4 million  , respectively; however, including netting arrangements and accrued interest, Farmer Mac's credit exposure was   zero   and   $47,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac held   no   cash as collateral for its derivatives in net asset positions and had   no   uncollateralized net asset positions.  As of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac held   no   cash collateral for its derivatives in net asset positions, resulting in uncollateralized net asset positions of   $47,000  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the fair value of Farmer Mac's derivatives in a net liability position including accrued interest but excluding netting arrangements and any adjustment for nonperformance risk, was   $132.3 million   and   $90.1 million  , respectively; however, including netting arrangements and accrued interest, the fair value of Farmer Mac's derivatives in a net liability position at the counterparty level, was   $117.6 million   and   $83.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Farmer Mac posted cash of   $89.7 million   and   no   investment securities as of   September 30, 2016   and posted cash of   $38.0 million   and   no   investment securities as of December 31, 2015.  Farmer Mac records posted cash as a reduction in the outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents and an increase in the balance of prepaid expenses and other assets.  Any investment securities posted as collateral are included in the investment securities balances on the consolidated balance sheets.  If Farmer Mac had breached certain provisions of the derivative contracts as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements or post additional collateral of   $27.9 million     and   $45.2 million  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, there were   no   financial derivatives in a net payable position where Farmer Mac was required to pledge collateral which the counterparty had the right to sell or repledge. 
    
  For certain derivatives, Farmer Mac clears interest rate swaps through a clearinghouse.  Farmer Mac posts initial and variation margin to the clearinghouses through which centrally-cleared derivatives and futures contracts are traded.  These collateral postings expose Farmer Mac to institutional credit risk in the event that either the clearinghouse or the futures commission merchant that Farmer Mac uses to post collateral to the clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations.  Conversely, the use of centrally-cleared derivatives mitigates Farmer Mac's credit risk to individual counterparties because clearinghouses assume the credit risk among counterparties in centrally-cleared derivatives transactions.  Of Farmer Mac's   $8.2 billion   notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $7.3 billion   were cleared through swap clearinghouses.  Of Farmer Mac's   $8.4 billion   notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2015,   $6.2 billion   were cleared through swap clearinghouses.

    LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES 
       
  Loans 
    
  Farmer Mac classifies loans as either held for investment or held for sale.  Loans held for investment are recorded at the unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized premium or discount and other cost adjustments.  Loans held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value determined on a pooled basis.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , Farmer Mac had no loans held for sale.  The following table displays the composition of the loan balances as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  :

    Unpaid principal balance is the basis of presentation in disclosures of outstanding balances for Farmer Mac's lines of business.  
       
  Allowance for Losses 
    
  Farmer Mac maintains an allowance for losses presented in two components on its consolidated balance sheets: (1) an allowance for loan losses to account for estimated probable losses on loans held, and (2) a reserve for losses to account for estimated probable losses on loans underlying LTSPCs and off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities (excluding AgVantage securities).  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , Farmer Mac's total allowances for losses were   $6.9 million   and   $6.6 million  , respectively.  See Note 6 for more information about off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

The following is a summary of the changes in the total allowance for losses for the three and   nine months   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015: 
    
  Table 5.2  

During   third quarter     2016  , Farmer Mac recorded provisions to its allowance for loan losses of   $0.2 million   and releases to its reserve for losses of   $0.2 million  .  The provisions to the allowance for loan losses recorded during third quarter   2016   were attributable to an increase in the general allowance due to overall net volume growth in on-balance sheet Farm   Ranch loans and downgrades in risk ratings for a small number of loans.  The releases to the reserve for losses recorded during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were attributable to the release of a specific reserve on an impaired livestock loan underlying an LTSPC that was required to be removed from the LTSPC pool by the originator during third quarter 2016.  Farmer Mac recorded   $0.1 million   of charge-offs to its allowance for loan losses during third quarter 2016.  
    
  During   third quarter   2015, Farmer Mac recorded releases to its allowance for loan losses of   $1.2 million   and provisions to its reserve for losses of   $0.9 million  .  The releases to the allowance for loan losses recorded during third quarter 2015 were primarily attributable to a reduction in the specific allowance for a permanent planting loan based on the updated appraised value of the collateral underlying such loan.  The provisions to the reserve for losses recorded during third quarter 2015 were attributable to an increase in the specific allowance on two impaired canola facility loans underlying an LTSPC with one borrower. Farmer Mac recorded   no   charge-offs to its allowance for loan losses during   third quarter   2015.

For the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , there were no troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs").  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, there were no TDRs.  For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the recorded investment of loans determined to be TDRs was   $1.1 million   both before and after restructuring.  As of   September 30, 2016   and 2015, there were   no   TDRs identified during the previous 12 months that were in default under the modified terms.  The impact of TDRs on Farmer Mac's allowance for loan losses was immaterial for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  
    
  When particular criteria are met, such as the default of the borrower, Farmer Mac becomes entitled to purchase the defaulted loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities (commonly referred to as "removal-of-account" provisions).  Farmer Mac records all such defaulted loans at their unpaid principal balance during the period in which Farmer Mac becomes entitled to purchase the loans and therefore regains effective control over the transferred loans.  In accordance with the terms of all LTSPCs, Farmer Mac acquires loans that are either   90 days   or   120 days   delinquent (depending on the provisions of the applicable agreement) upon the request of the counterparty.  Subsequent to the purchase, these defaulted loans are treated as nonaccrual loans and, therefore, interest is accounted for on the cash basis.  Any decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment.

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac purchased   three   defaulted loans having an unpaid principal balance of   $1.1 million   from pools underlying LTSPCs and Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities.  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac purchased   eight   defaulted loans having an unpaid principal balance of   $2.5 million   from pools underlying LTSPCs and Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities.   During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , Farmer Mac purchased   one   defaulted loan having an unpaid principal balance of   $0.3 million   from a pool underlying a Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Security.  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , Farmer Mac purchased   three   defaulted loans having an unpaid principal balance of   $2.2 million   from pools underlying Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities.

The original loan-to-value ratio is calculated by dividing the loan principal balance at the time of guarantee, purchase, or commitment by the appraised value at the date of loan origination or, when available, the updated appraised value at the time of guarantee, purchase, or commitment.  Current loan-to-value ratios may be higher or lower than the original loan-to-value ratios.

    OFF-BALANCE SHEET GUARANTEES AND LONG-TERM STANDBY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS   
       
  Farmer Mac offers two credit enhancement alternatives to direct loan purchases that allow approved lenders the ability to retain the cash flow benefits of their loans and increase their liquidity and lending capacity:  (1) Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, which are available through the Farm   Ranch, USDA Guarantees, Rural Utilities, or Institutional Credit lines of business, and (2) LTSPCs, which are available through the Farm   Ranch or Rural Utilities lines of business.  
    
  The following table presents the maximum principal amount of potential undiscounted future payments that Farmer Mac could be required to make under all off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , not including offsets provided by any recourse provisions, recoveries from third parties, or collateral for the underlying loans:

    Relates to a revolving floating rate AgVantage facility subject to specified contractual terms. Farmer Mac receives a fixed fee based on the full dollar amount of the facility. 
       
  Eligible loans and other eligible assets may be placed into trusts that are used as vehicles for the securitization of the transferred assets and the Farmer Mac-guaranteed beneficial interests in the trusts are sold to investors.  The following table summarizes the significant cash flows received from and paid to trusts used for Farmer Mac securitizations:

Farmer Mac has recorded a liability for its obligation to stand ready under the guarantee in the guarantee and commitment obligation on the consolidated balance sheets.  This liability approximated   $6.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $8.3 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the weighted-average remaining maturity of all loans underlying off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, excluding AgVantage securities, was   10.8 years   and   11.3 years  ,

     Table of Contents  

respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the weighted-average remaining maturity of the off-balance sheet AgVantage securities was   0.9 years   and   1.7 years  , respectively. 
    
  Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments 
    
  An LTSPC is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase eligible loans from an identified pool of loans under specified circumstances set forth in the applicable agreement, either for cash or in exchange for Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, on one or more undetermined future dates.  As consideration for its assumption of the credit risk on loans underlying an LTSPC, Farmer Mac receives a commitment fee payable monthly in arrears in an amount approximating what would have been the guarantee fee if the transaction were structured as a swap for Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities. 
    
  The maximum principal amount of potential undiscounted future payments that Farmer Mac could be requested to make under all LTSPCs, not including offsets provided by any recourse provisions, recoveries from third parties, or collateral for the underlying loans, was   $3.1 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $2.8 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining maturity of all loans underlying LTSPCs was   15.0 years   and   14.6 years  , respectively.  For those LTSPCs issued or modified on or after January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac has recorded a liability for its obligation to stand ready under the commitment in the guarantee and commitment obligation on the consolidated balance sheets.  This liability approximated   $31.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $30.3 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 

Non-Controlling Interest in Farmer Mac II LLC 
    
  On   January 25, 2010  , Farmer Mac completed a private offering of   $250.0 million   of securities issued by a newly formed Delaware statutory trust.  The trust securities, called Farm Asset-Linked Capital Securities or "FALConS," represented undivided beneficial ownership interests in   250,000   shares of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (the "Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock") of Farmer Mac's subsidiary, Farmer Mac II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.  The Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock had a liquidation preference of   $1,000   per share.  On May 14, 2014, Farmer Mac purchased   $6.0 million   of FALConS from certain holders.  On March 30, 2015, Farmer Mac II LLC redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock which, in turn, triggered the redemption of all of the outstanding FALConS on that same day.  Farmer Mac recognized an expense of   $8.1 million   in deferred issuance costs upon the retirement of the Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock.  
    
  Common Stock 
    
  On September 8, 2015, Farmer Mac's board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing Farmer Mac to repurchase up to   $25 million   of its outstanding Class C non-voting common stock through September 8, 2017.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had repurchased approximately   668,000   shares of Class C non-voting common stock at a cost of approximately   $19.6 million   pursuant to the share repurchase program.

Capital Requirements 
    
  Farmer Mac is subject to the following capital requirements: 

Statutory minimum capital requirement   Farmer Mac's statutory minimum capital level is an amount of core capital (stockholders' equity less accumulated other comprehensive income) equal to the sum of   2.75 percent   of Farmer Mac's aggregate on-balance sheet assets, as calculated for regulatory purposes, plus   0.75 percent   of the aggregate off-balance sheet obligations of Farmer Mac, specifically including:    
                
    the unpaid principal balance of outstanding Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities; 
                
    instruments issued or guaranteed by Farmer Mac that are substantially equivalent to Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, including LTSPCs; and 
                
    other off-balance sheet obligations of Farmer Mac. 
                
    Statutory critical capital requirement   Farmer Mac's critical capital level is an amount of core capital equal to   50 percent   of the total minimum capital requirement at that time. 
                
    Risk-based capital requirement   Farmer Mac's charter directs FCA to establish a risk-based capital stress test for Farmer Mac, using specified stress-test parameters. 
       
  Farmer Mac is required to comply with the higher of the minimum capital requirement and the risk-based capital requirement.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the minimum capital requirement was greater than the risk-based capital requirement.  Farmer Mac's ability to declare and pay dividends could be restricted if it fails to comply with applicable capital requirements.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac's minimum capital requirement was   $474.8 million   and its core capital level was   $587.1 million  , which was   $112.3 million   above the minimum capital requirement as of that date.  As of December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac's minimum capital requirement was   $462.1 million   and its core capital level was   $564.5 million  , which was   $102.4 million   above the minimum capital requirement as of that date. 
    
  In accordance with FCA's rule on Farmer Mac's capital planning, and as part of Farmer Mac's capital plan, Farmer Mac has adopted a policy for maintaining a sufficient level of Tier 1 capital (consisting of retained earnings, paid-in-capital, common stock, qualifying preferred stock, and accumulated other comprehensive income allocable to investments not included in one of the four operating lines of business) and imposing restrictions on Tier 1-eligible dividends and any discretionary bonus payments in the event that this capital falls below specified thresholds.

    FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value included financial instruments valued at   $7.0 billion   whose fair values were estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values (i.e., level 3).  These financial instruments measured as level 3 represented   44 percent   of total assets and   69 percent   of financial instruments measured at fair value as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , Farmer Mac's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value included financial instruments valued at   $6.1 billion   whose fair values were estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values.  These financial instruments measured as level 3 represented   39 percent   of total assets and   69 percent   of financial instruments measured at fair value as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Net transfers in and/or out of the different levels within the fair value hierarchy are based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the reporting period.  There were no transfers within the fair

The following tables present additional information about the significant unobservable inputs, such as discount rates and constant prepayment rates ("CPR"), used in the fair value measurements categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  . 
    
  Table 8.3 

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and USDA Securities are prepayment rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.  Typically, significant increases (decreases) in any of these inputs in isolation may result in materially lower (higher) fair value measurements.  Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, Farmer Mac would expect average discount rates to increase and would likely expect a corresponding decrease in forecasted prepayment rates.  Conversely, in a declining interest rate environment, Farmer Mac would expect average discount rates to decrease and would likely expect a corresponding increase in forecasted prepayment rates.  Prepayment rates are not presented in the table above for AgVantage securities because they generally do not pay down principal based on amortization schedules but instead typically have fixed maturity dates when the secured general obligations are due.

Disclosures on Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The following table sets forth the estimated fair values and carrying values for financial assets, liabilities, and guarantees and commitments as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  : 
    
  Table 8.4 

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of their approximate fair value and is classified as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.  Investment securities primarily are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Farmer Mac internally models the fair value of its loan portfolio, including loans held for sale, loans held for investment and loans held for investment in consolidated trusts, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, and USDA Securities by discounting the projected cash flows of these instruments at projected interest rates.  The fair values are based on the present value of expected cash flows using management's best estimate of certain key assumptions, which include prepayment speeds, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.  These fair value measurements do not take into consideration the fair value of the underlying property and are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  Financial derivatives primarily are valued using unadjusted counterparty valuations and are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value of the guarantee fees receivable/obligation and debt securities of consolidated trusts are estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows of the underlying mortgage assets using management's best estimate of certain key assumptions, which include prepayments speeds, forward yield curves, and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved and are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  Notes payable are valued by discounting the expected cash flows of these instruments using a yield curve derived from market prices observed for similar agency securities and are also classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  Because the cash flows of Farmer Mac's financial  

49 

     Table of Contents  

instruments may be interest rate path dependent, estimated fair values and projected discount rates for level 3 financial instruments are derived using a Monte Carlo simulation model.  Different market assumptions and estimation methodologies could significantly affect estimated fair value amounts.

Overview 
    
  In third quarter 2016, Farmer Mac increased its outstanding business volume by   $0.1 billion  , to   $17.2 billion  , driven primarily by net portfolio growth of   $149.9 million   in Farm   Ranch loans and   $60.5 million   in USDA Securities.  Farmer Mac's overall credit quality remained stable during third quarter 2016, as the total allowance for losses remained relatively unchanged from second quarter 2016, substandard assets increased modestly, and 90-day delinquencies decreased.   The discussion below of Farmer Mac's financial information includes measures of financial performance that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and these are considered "non-GAAP" measures.  For more information about the non-GAAP measures Farmer Mac uses, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Use of Non-GAAP Measures." 
    
  Net Income and Core Earnings 
    
  Farmer Mac's net income attributable to common stockholders for third quarter   2016   was   $16.4 million  , compared to   $8.4 million   for third quarter 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to the effects of unrealized fair value changes on financial derivatives and hedged assets, which was a   $0.9 million   after-tax gain in third quarter   2016  , compared to a   $4.5 million   after-tax loss in third quarter 2015.  For more information about changes in net income attributable to common stockholders, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations." 
    
  Farmer Mac's non-GAAP core earnings for third quarter   2016   were   $14.4 million  , compared to   $13.0 million   in second quarter 2016 and   $13.2 million   in third quarter   2015  .   

56 

     Table of Contents  

The   $1.4 million   sequential quarterly increase in core earnings was primarily attributable to a   $0.8 million   after-tax increase in net effective spread. Also contributing to the increase was a decrease in credit-related expenses resulting from net releases from the allowance for losses of $20,000 after-tax in third quarter 2016 compared to net provisions of   $0.3 million   after-tax in second quarter 2016.  Operating expenses also decreased sequentially by   $0.3 million   after-tax, driven by lower general and administrative and compensation and benefits expenses.  The decrease in general and administrative expenses was driven by a decrease in legal and accounting fees. The decrease in compensation and benefits expenses was due to seasonally higher payroll taxes during second quarter 2016 related to payouts of variable incentive compensation which did not recur during third quarter 2016.  
    
  The year-over-year   $1.2 million   increase in core earnings was primarily attributable to an increase in net effective spread of   $1.2 million   after-tax and an increase in guarantee and commitment fee income of   $0.1 million   after-tax.  The increase was offset in part by an increase of   $0.1 million   after-tax in credit-related expenses due to a decrease in the release from the allowance for losses in third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015.  Operating expenses were flat between third quarter 2016 and third quarter 2015, as lower general and administrative expenses were offset by an increase in compensation and benefits expenses.  The lower general and administrative expenses were attributable to a decrease in legal fees and outside professional services fees for application and information systems consulting.  The higher compensation and benefits expenses resulted from an increase in headcount and employee health insurance costs. 
    
  Fair value changes on derivatives do not affect core earnings.

  Net Interest Income and Net Effective Spread 
    
  Net interest income was   $35.6 million   in third quarter 2016 compared to   $32.2 million   in third quarter 2015.  In percentage terms, net interest income for third quarter 2016 was   0.89 percent   compared to   0.90 percent   in third quarter 2015.  The year-over-year increase in dollars was due to several factors.  One factor was the impact of an increase in short-term interest rates on assets and liabilities indexed to LIBOR due to the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in fourth quarter 2015.  This effect on net interest income occurred because interest expense used to calculate net interest income does not include all the funding expenses related to these assets, specifically the expense on undesignated financial derivatives.  Alternatively, the increase in short-term rates on assets and liabilities indexed to LIBOR would not have a similar effect on net effective spread as described below because net effective spread includes interest expense from all funding related to such assets, including interest expense from undesignated financial derivatives.  Also contributing to the year-over-year increase in net interest income was (1) growth in outstanding business volume, (2) a wider spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced in third quarter 2016 as compared to the original security, and (3) an increase in the net effect of consolidated trusts due to an increase in securitization activity of Farm   Ranch loans during 2015 and the first nine months of 2016.  Farmer Mac earns the difference between the interest income recognized on loans in consolidated trusts and the related interest expense recognized on debt securities of consolidated trusts held by third parties.  The year-over-year decrease in net interest income in percentage terms primarily related to a higher average balance maintained in lower-earning cash and

     Table of Contents  

investment securities in third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015 to increase Farmer Mac's liquidity position and to a tighter spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced in first quarter 2016 at a shorter maturity than the original security. 
    
  Net effective spread, a non-GAAP measure, was   $32.2 million   in third quarter 2016, compared to   $31.0 million   in second quarter 2016 and   $30.4 million   in third quarter 2015.  In percentage terms, net effective spread for third quarter 2016 was   0.86 percent  , compared to   0.84 percent   in second quarter 2016 and   0.88 percent   in third quarter 2015.  Farmer Mac uses net effective spread as an alternative measure to net interest income because management believes it is a useful metric that accurately reflects the economics of the net spread between all the assets owned by Farmer Mac and all related funding, including any associated derivatives, some of which may not be reflected in net interest income under GAAP.    For more information about the non-GAAP measures Farmer Mac uses, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Use of Non-GAAP Measures." 
    
  The sequential increase in quarterly net effective spread in dollar terms was primarily due to (1) continued improvement in third quarter 2016 of LIBOR-based funding costs for floating rate assets indexed to LIBOR due to adjustments in Farmer Mac's funding strategies for these types of assets and some improvement in the LIBOR-based funding market, (2) growth in average outstanding business volume, and (3) a wider spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced during third quarter 2016.  The sequential increase in quarterly net effective spread in percentage terms was primarily due to the improvement in third quarter 2016 of LIBOR-based funding costs and a wider spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced during third quarter 2016.   
    
  The year-over-year increase in net effective spread in dollar terms was primarily attributable to growth in average outstanding business volume and a wider spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced during third quarter 2016.  The year-over-year decrease in quarterly net effective spread in percentage terms was due to a higher average balance maintained in lower-earning cash and investment securities in third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015 to increase Farmer Mac's liquidity position, partially offset by the increase in spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced during third quarter 2016. 
    
  For a reconciliation of net interest income to net effective spread, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net Interest Income." 
    
  Business Volume 
    
  Farmer Mac added   $1.1 billion   of new business volume during third quarter 2016.  The new business volume included purchases of   $528.2 million   of AgVantage securities, purchases of   $282.7 million   of newly originated Farm   Ranch loans, Farm   Ranch loans added under LTSPCs of   $155.7 million  , purchases of   $87.3 million   of USDA Securities, issuance of   $31.9 million   of Farmer Mac Guaranteed USDA Securities, and purchases of Rural Utilities loans of   $20.0 million  . The new business volume in AgVantage securities included a $500.0 million AgVantage security which was used to refinance an AgVantage security that matured in third quarter 2016. Taking into account maturities and paydowns on existing assets, Farmer Mac's outstanding business volume was   $17.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $0.1 billion   from June 30, 2016,   $1.3 billion   from   December 31, 2015  , and   $1.6 billion   from September 30, 2015.

Capital 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac's core capital level was   $587.1 million  ,   $112.3 million   above the minimum capital level required by Farmer Mac's statutory charter.  As of   December 31, 2015  , Farmer Mac's core capital level was   $564.5 million  , which was   $102.4 million   above the minimum capital requirement.  The increase in capital in excess of the minimum capital level was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of cash and investment securities needed to manage Farmer Mac's liquidity position in third quarter 2016 and an increase in retained earnings. 
    
  Farmer Mac's board of directors approved a share repurchase program during third quarter 2015 authorizing Farmer Mac to repurchase up to $25 million of its outstanding Class C non-voting common stock through September 2017.  Farmer Mac did not repurchase any shares during third quarter 2016 under this program.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had repurchased approximately   668,000   shares of Class C non-voting common stock at a cost of approximately   $19.6 million   under the share repurchase program. 
    
  Credit Quality 
    
  Farmer Mac continued to maintain stable credit quality, as substandard assets increased modestly in terms of both dollars and percentage of the Farm   Ranch portfolio, while the total allowance for losses decreased modestly in terms of both dollars and percentage of the Farm   Ranch portfolio from their respective levels as of June 30, 2016.  The release from the total allowance for losses of   $31,000   during third quarter 2016 primarily related to the release of a specific reserve on an impaired livestock loan underlying an LTSPC that was required to be removed from the LTSPC pool by the originator during third quarter 2016, partially offset by an increase in the general allowance due to overall net volume growth in on-balance sheet Farm   Ranch loans. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac's 90-day delinquencies were   $18.4 million   (  0.31 percent   of the Farm   Ranch portfolio), compared to   $32.1 million   (  0.56 percent   of the Farm   Ranch portfolio) as of December 31, 2015, and   $36.7 million   (  0.67 percent   of the Farm   Ranch portfolio) as of   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in 90-day delinquencies from year-end primarily related to (1) the workout in January 2016 of two Agricultural Storage and Processing loans that financed one canola facility and (2) the receipt by Farmer Mac of funds in the amount of $5.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, to pay off two long-standing delinquent timber loans with the same borrower. For more information about Farmer Mac's credit metrics, including 90-day delinquencies, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk   Loans and Guarantees." 

Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
    
  In the accompanying analysis of its financial information, Farmer Mac sometimes uses measures of financial performance that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and these are considered "non-GAAP measures."  Specifically, Farmer Mac uses the following non-GAAP measures: "core earnings," "core earnings per share," and "net effective spread."  Farmer Mac uses these non-GAAP measures to measure corporate economic performance and develop financial plans because, in management's view, they are useful alternative measures in understanding Farmer Mac's economic performance, transaction economics, and business trends. 

59 

     Table of Contents  

The non-GAAP financial measures that Farmer Mac uses may not be comparable to similarly labeled non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by other companies.  Farmer Mac's disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is intended to be supplemental in nature, and is not meant to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as more important than, the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  
    
  Core Earnings and Core Earnings per Share 
    
  Core earnings and core earnings per share principally differ from net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per common share, respectively, by excluding the effects of fair value fluctuations. These fluctuations are not expected to have a cumulative net impact on financial condition or results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP if the related financial instruments are held to maturity, as is generally expected.  Core earnings and core earnings per share also differ from net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per common share, respectively, by excluding specified infrequent or unusual transactions that Farmer Mac believes are not indicative of future operating results and that may not reflect the trends and economic financial performance of Farmer Mac's core business.  For example, the loss from retirement of the Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock in first quarter 2015 has been excluded from core earnings and core earnings per share because it is not a frequently occurring transaction and not indicative of future operating results.  This is also consistent with Farmer Mac's previous treatment of these types of origination costs associated with securities underwriting that are capitalized and deferred during the life of the security.  For a reconciliation of Farmer Mac's net income attributable to common stockholders to core earnings and of earnings per common share to core earnings per share, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations." 
    
  Net Effective Spread 
    
  Farmer Mac uses net effective spread to measure the net spread Farmer Mac earns between its interest-earning assets and the related net funding costs of these assets.  Net effective spread differs from net interest income and net interest yield because it excludes: (1) the amortization of premiums and discounts on assets consolidated at fair value that are amortized as adjustments to yield in interest income over the contractual or estimated remaining lives of the underlying assets, and (2) interest income and interest expense related to consolidated trusts with beneficial interests owned by third parties, which are presented on Farmer Mac's consolidated balance sheets as "  Loans held for investment in consolidated trusts, at amortized cost  ."  Farmer Mac excludes from net effective spread the premiums and discounts on assets consolidated at fair value because they either do not reflect actual cash premiums paid for the assets at acquisition or are not expected to have an economic effect on Farmer Mac's financial performance if the assets are held to maturity, as is generally expected. Farmer Mac also excludes from net effective spread the interest income and interest expense associated with the consolidated trusts, and the average balance of the loans underlying these trusts to reflect management's view that the net interest income Farmer Mac earns on the related Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities owned by third parties is effectively a guarantee fee.  Accordingly, the excluded interest income and interest expense associated with consolidated trusts is reclassified to guarantee and commitment fees for purposes of determining Farmer Mac's core earnings. 
    
  Net effective spread also principally differs from net interest income and net interest yield because it includes the accrual of income and expense related to the contractual amounts due on financial derivatives that are not designated in hedge accounting relationships ("undesignated financial derivatives").   

60 

     Table of Contents  

Farmer Mac uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk exposure by synthetically modifying the interest rate reset or maturity characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.  The accrual of the contractual amounts due on interest rate swaps designated in hedge accounting relationships is included as an adjustment to the yield or cost of the hedged item and is included in net interest income.  For undesignated financial derivatives, Farmer Mac records the income or expense related to the accrual of the contractual amounts due in "  (Losses)/gains on financial derivatives and hedging activities  " on the consolidated statements of operations.  However, the accrual of the contractual amounts due for undesignated financial derivatives are included in Farmer Mac's calculation of net effective spread, which is intended to reflect management's view of the net spread between an asset and all of its related funding, including any associated derivatives, whether or not they are in a hedge accounting relationship.  For a reconciliation of net interest income and net interest yield to net effective spread, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Net Interest Income." 

Results of Operations 
    
  Farmer Mac's net income attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $16.4 million  , or   $1.54   per diluted common share, compared to   $8.4 million  , or   $0.74   per diluted common share, for the same period in   2015  .  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac's net income attributable to common stockholders was   $38.7 million  , or   $3.60   per diluted common share, compared to   $32.3 million  , or   $2.85   per diluted common share, for the same period in 2015.  Farmer Mac's non-GAAP core earnings for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $14.4 million  , or   $1.36   per diluted common share, compared to   $13.2 million  , or $  1.17   per diluted common share, for the same period in   2015  .  Farmer Mac's non-GAAP core earnings for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $39.9 million  , or   $3.71   per diluted common share, compared to   $33.9 million  , or   $2.99   per diluted common share, for the same period in 2015.

The five non-GAAP reconciling items between net income attributable to common stockholders and core earnings are: 
    
  1.  Unrealized (losses)/gains on financial derivatives and hedging activities. The table below calculates the non-GAAP reconciling item for unrealized (losses)/gains on financial derivatives and hedging activities. 
    
  Table 3 

2.  Unrealized gains on trading securities.   The unrealized gains on trading securities are reported on Farmer Mac's consolidated statements of operations, which represent changes during the period in fair values for trading assets remaining on Farmer Mac's balance sheet as of the end of the reporting period. 
  3.  Amortization of premiums/discounts and deferred gains on assets consolidated at fair value. The amount of this non-GAAP reconciling item is the recorded amount of premium, discount, or deferred gain amortization during the reporting period on those assets for which the premium, discount, or deferred gain was based on the application of an accounting principle (e.g., consolidation of variable interest entities) rather than on a cash transaction (e.g., a purchase price premium or discount). 
  4.  The net effect of settlements on agency forward contracts. These agency forward contracts are used as a short-term economic hedge of the issuance of debt.  For GAAP purposes, realized gains or losses on settlements of agency forward contracts used as a short-term hedge of the issuance of debt are reported in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they occur.  For core earnings purposes, these realized gains or losses on settlements of agency forward contracts are deferred and amortized as yield adjustments over the term of the related debt, which generally ranges from 3 to 15 years. 
  5.  The loss on retirement of the Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock.  This loss in first quarter 2015 has been excluded from core earnings because it is not a frequently occurring transaction and is not indicative of future operating results.  This is also consistent with Farmer Mac's previous treatment of these types of origination costs associated with securities underwriting that are capitalized and deferred during the life of the security. 
  The following sections provide more detail regarding specific components of Farmer Mac's results of operations.

Net Interest Income  .  The following table provides information regarding interest-earning assets and funding for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The average balance of non-accruing loans is included in the average balance of loans, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, and USDA Securities presented, though the related income is accounted for on a cash basis.  Therefore, as the average balance of non-accruing loans and the income received increases or decreases, the net interest income and yield will fluctuate accordingly.  The average balance of loans in consolidated trusts with beneficial interests owned by third parties is disclosed in the net effect of consolidated trusts and is not included in the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  The interest income and expense associated with these trusts are shown in the net effect of consolidated trusts.  
    
  Table 4 

(1)   
    Excludes interest income of   $23.0 million   and   $14.2 million   in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to consolidated trusts with beneficial interests owned by third parties. 
               (2)   
    Includes current portion of long-term notes. 
               (3)   
    Excludes interest expense of   $20.0 million   and   $12.1 million   in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to consolidated trusts with beneficial interests owned by third parties. 
               (4)   
    Includes the effect of consolidated trusts with beneficial interests owned by third parties. 
       
  Net interest income was   $103.6 million     for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $94.8 million   for the same period in 2015.  The overall net interest yield was   89   basis points for both the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015.   
     
  The   $8.8 million   increase in net interest income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was due to several factors.  One factor was the impact of an increase in short-term interest rates on assets and liabilities indexed to LIBOR due to the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in fourth quarter 2015.  This effect on net interest income occurred because interest expense used to calculate net interest income does not include all the funding expenses related to these assets, specifically the expense on undesignated financial derivatives.  Alternatively, the increase in short-term rates on assets and liabilities indexed to LIBOR would not have a similar effect on net effective spread because net effective spread includes interest expense from all funding related to such assets, including interest expense from undesignated financial derivatives.  Another factor contributing to the year-over-year increase in net interest income was an increase in the average outstanding balance of Farm   Ranch loans, USDA Securities, and AgVantage securities.  Also  

67 

     Table of Contents  

contributing to the increase was (1) a decrease in net yield adjustments related to amortization of premiums and discounts on assets consolidated at fair value driven by slower prepayments on those assets, (2) a wider spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced in third quarter 2016 as compared to the original security, and (3) an increase in the net effect of consolidated trusts due to an increase in securitization activity of Farm   Ranch loans during 2015 and the first nine months of 2016.  Farmer Mac earns the difference between the interest income recognized on loans in consolidated trusts and the related interest expense recognized on debt securities of consolidated trusts held by third parties.  The increase was offset in part by (1) an increase in yield adjustments from amortization of purchase premiums on certain Farm   Ranch loans and (2) a tighter spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced in first quarter 2016 at a shorter maturity than the original security.  
    
  The following table sets forth information regarding changes in the components of Farmer Mac's net interest income prior to consolidation of certain trusts for the periods indicated.  For each category, information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by old volume).  Combined rate/volume variances, the third element of the calculation, are allocated based on their relative size.   
    
  Table 5 

(1)   
    Excludes the effect of debt in consolidated trusts with beneficial interests owned by third parties.       
       
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in 2015, the increase in income on interest-earning assets and the increase in expense on other interest-bearing liabilities due to changes in rate resulted from the repricing of both interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities due to the Federal Reserve's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in fourth quarter 2015.  The increase in income due to changes in rate on loans, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, and USDA Securities was due to a decrease in net yield adjustments related to amortization of premiums and discounts on assets consolidated at fair value driven by slower prepayments on those assets in the first nine months of 2016.  That increase in income was offset in part by a decline in market rates on AgVantage securities acquired or refinanced during 2015 and the first nine months of 2016 and an increase in yield adjustments from amortization of purchase premiums on certain Farm   Ranch loans.  The increases in income from interest-earning assets and in expense from other interest-bearing liabilities due to changes in volume reflect the increase in the average balance of on-balance sheet assets and the related funding for those assets, respectively.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net interest income and net yield to net effective spread.  This spread is measured by including income or expense related to contractual amounts due on undesignated financial derivatives (the income or expense related to financial derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships is already included in net interest income) and excluding the amortization of premiums and discounts on assets consolidated at fair value and the net effects of consolidated trusts with beneficial interests owned by third parties.  
    
  Table 6  

Net effective spread was   $32.2 million   and   $93.2 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $30.4 million   and   $89.4 million   for the same periods in 2015, respectively.  In percentage terms, net effective spread for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   0.86 percent   and   0.84 percent  , respectively, compared to   0.88 percent   and   0.87 percent   for the same periods in 2015, respectively. 
    
  For the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, the contraction in net effective spread in percentage terms was primarily attributable to (1) market increases in LIBOR-based short-term funding costs which primarily impacted first quarter 2016, (2) a tighter spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced in first quarter 2016 at a shorter maturity than the original security, (3) a higher average balance in lower-earning cash and investment securities in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 to increase Farmer Mac's liquidity position, and (4) an increase in yield adjustments from amortization of purchase premiums on certain Farm   Ranch loans.  Additionally, net effective spread was negatively impacted by the decrease in net non-interest bearing funding in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period last year due to the redemption of Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock on March 30, 2015, as certain interest-earning assets which were previously funded with capital during first quarter 2015 are currently being funded with interest-bearing liabilities.  The year-over-year increase in dollars was primarily attributable to growth in outstanding business volume and a wider spread on a large AgVantage security that was refinanced during third quarter 2016 as compared to the original security. 
    
  See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding net interest income and net effective spread from Farmer Mac's individual business segments.  Additionally, see " Supplemental Information" for quarterly net effective spread by line of business.

Provision for and Release of Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Losses  . The following table summarizes the components of Farmer Mac's total allowance for losses for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015: 
    
  Table 7 

The provisions to the allowance for loan losses recorded during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were attributable to an increase in the general allowance due to overall net volume growth in on-balance sheet Farm   Ranch loans and downgrades in risk ratings for a small number of loans.  The provisions to the allowance for loan losses recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were also attributable to the establishment of a specific allowance for a long-standing impaired permanent planting loan due to collateral shortfalls relative to the unpaid principal balance and an increase in the specific allowance for on-balance sheet impaired loans resulting from a modest increase in the outstanding balance of such loans.  The releases from the reserve for losses recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were attributable to the release of a specific reserve on an impaired livestock loan underlying an LTSPC that was required to be removed from the LTSPC pool by the originator during third quarter 2016 and releases in the general reserve of Agricultural Storage and Processing loans underlying LTSPCs due to paydowns of these loans at par.  The releases from the reserve for losses recognized during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were offset in part by provisions to the reserve for losses attributable to an increase in the general reserve due to downgrades in risk rating on certain unimpaired crop loans and permanent planting loans underlying LTSPCs.  
    
  The releases from the allowance for loan losses for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   were primarily attributable to a reduction in the specific allowance on a permanent planting loan based on the updated appraised value of the collateral underlying such loan. The provisions to the reserve for losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily attributable to a $1.3 million increase in the specific reserve for two impaired loans to one borrower financing a canola facility. Both of these loans were under an LTSPC. The establishment in second quarter 2015 of a specific reserve for these loans was due to a downgrade in risk rating resulting from collateral shortfalls relative to the unpaid principal balance for such loans, and the increase in the specific reserve for these loans was due to the borrower's delinquency for 90 days or more during third quarter 2015. The provisions to the reserve for

     Table of Contents  

losses during third quarter 2015 were partially offset by a decrease in the general reserve of Agricultural Storage and Processing loans underlying LTSPCs due to repayment of these loans at par. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Farmer Mac's allowance for loan losses was   $5.0 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively, and its reserve for losses was   $2.0 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively.  See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk   Loans and Guarantees." 
    
  Guarantee and Commitment Fees  .  Guarantee and commitment fees, which compensate Farmer Mac for assuming the credit risk on loans underlying off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs, were   $3.8 million     and     $11.1 million  , respectively, for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.5 million   and   $10.3 million   for the same periods in 2015, respectively.  The increase in guarantee and commitment fees was attributable to the addition of   $0.5 billion   in third quarter 2015 and   $0.4 billion   in second quarter 2016 of Rural Utilities loans under LTSPCs, offset in part by a lower average outstanding balance of off-balance sheet Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities. 
    
  (Losses)/Gains on Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities  .  The effect of unrealized and realized gains and losses on Farmer Mac's financial derivatives and hedging activities was net losses of   $1.6 million   and   $13.1 million   for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to net losses of     $9.6 million   and and net gains of   $0.9 million   for the same periods in 2015, respectively.

     Table of Contents  

The components of gains and losses on financial derivatives and hedging activities for three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 are summarized in the following table: 
    
  Table 8  

(1)   
    Included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness as of   September 30, 2016  , but excluded from the amounts in the table, were losses of   $1.0 million   and   $4.2 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , attributable to the fair value of the swaps at the inception of the hedging relationship.  Accordingly, the amounts recognized as hedge ineffectiveness for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were losses of   $0.2 million   and gains of   $1.5 million  , respectively.  The comparable amounts as of   September 30, 2015   were losses of $  2.9 million   and   $8.6 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , attributable to the fair value of the swaps at the inception of the hedging relationship and, accordingly, gains of $  0.3 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , attributable to hedge ineffectiveness.  
       
  Changes in the fair values of Farmer Mac's open derivative positions for both designated and undesignated hedges are captured in the table above in unrealized losses due to fair value changes and are primarily the result of fluctuations in long-term interest rates.  For financial derivatives designated in fair value hedge accounting relationships, changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk are also included in the table above in unrealized (losses)/gains due to fair value changes.  For financial derivatives designated in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value are included as losses on cash flow hedges.  The accrual of periodic cash settlements for interest paid or received from Farmer Mac's interest rate swaps that are not designated in hedge accounting relationships is shown as expense related to financial derivatives.  Payments or receipts to terminate derivative positions or net cash settled forward sales contracts on the debt of other GSEs and U.S. Treasury futures that are not designated in hedge accounting relationships are included in losses due to terminations or net settlements.     
    
  Gains on Trading Securities  .  During the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac recorded unrealized gains on trading securities of   $1.2 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively, compared to unrealized losses of   $8,000   and unrealized gains of   $0.5 million   during the same periods in 2015, respectively.  Of the total gains recognized during the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.4 million   of losses and   $0.2 million   of gains related to financial assets selected to be carried at fair

     Table of Contents  

value with changes in fair value included in earnings (the fair value option), compared to recorded losses  of   $0.1 million   and gains of   $0.1 million   during the same period in 2015.   
    
  Other Income  .  Other income totaled   $0.7 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively, for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.1 million   and   $1.9 million   for the same periods in 2015.  Other income during the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   included the recognition of $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of appraisal fees received by Farmer Mac's consolidated appraisal company subsidiary, AgVisory, which was formed in fourth quarter 2014 compared to $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the same periods in 2015. Other income during the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   also included the recognition of $0.1 million of gains and $0.3 million of losses, respectively, previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income related to fair value changes of certain available-for-sale securities contributed to Farmer Mac II LLC in 2010 and other miscellaneous items, compared to the recognition of $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of previously deferred gains for the same periods in 2015.  
    
  Compensation and Employee Benefits  .      Compensation and employee benefits were   $5.4 million   and   $16.8 million  , respectively, for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5.2 million   and   $16.7 million  , respectively, for the same periods in 2015.  The year-over-year quarterly increase in compensation and employee benefits was due primarily to an increase in headcount and employee health insurance costs. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was also due primarily to an increase in headcount and employee health insurance costs offset in part by lower payouts of variable incentive compensation awarded in second quarter 2016 compared to second quarter 2015.  Compensation costs for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   included $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in compensation costs for Farmer Mac's consolidated appraisal company subsidiary, AgVisory, compared to $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for the same periods last year.  
    
  General and Administrative Expenses  .    General and administrative expenses, including legal, audit, and consulting fees, were   $3.5 million   and   $10.8 million  , respectively, for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $3.7 million   and   $9.9 million   for the same periods in 2015.  The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal fees and outside professional services fees for application and information systems consulting. The increase in general and administrative expenses in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 was due primarily to higher consulting fees and information services expenses related to corporate strategic initiatives, continued technology and business infrastructure investments, and expenses related to business development efforts.  Additionally, general and administrative costs for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   included $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in operating expenses for Farmer Mac's consolidated appraisal company subsidiary, AgVisory, compared to $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, for the same periods last year.  
    
  Regulatory Fees  .    Regulatory fees, which consist of the fees paid to FCA, were   $0.6 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively, for both the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  FCA has advised Farmer Mac that its estimated fees for the federal fiscal year ending September 30, 2017 will increase approximately $50,000 to $2.5 million ($0.625 million per federal fiscal quarter) as compared to the prior federal fiscal year.  After the end of a federal government fiscal year, FCA may revise its prior year estimated assessments to reflect actual costs incurred, and has issued both additional assessments and refunds in the past.

Income Tax Expense  .  Income tax expense totaled   $10.5 million   and   $26.3 million  , respectively, for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to income tax expense of   $6.3 million   and   $24.3 million   for the same periods in 2015.  The increase in income tax expense in the first nine months of 2016, offset in part by lower pre-tax income, compared to the same period last year was due to two items that occurred during first quarter 2015 but did not recur during the first nine months of 2016: (1) the consolidated tax benefits recognized from the dividends declared on Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock, which is included in the presentation of "Net income attributable to non-controlling interest" on the consolidated statements of operations on a pre-tax basis, and (2) the loss on retirement of the Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock.  These items were also the primary reasons why Farmer Mac's effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
    
  Loss on Retirement of Preferred Stock  .  On March 30, 2015, Farmer Mac II LLC redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock, which, in turn, triggered the redemption of all of the outstanding related Farm Asset-Linked Capital Securities, or "FALConS," on that same day.  As a result, Farmer Mac recognized an expense in first quarter 2015 of   $8.1 million   of deferred issuance costs related to those shares of Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock as "Loss on retirement of preferred stock" on the consolidated statements of operations.  

Business Volume  .  During   third quarter     2016  , Farmer Mac added   $1.1 billion   of new business volume compared to   $1.4 billion   in   third quarter   2015. Specifically, Farmer Mac: 

purchased   $528.2 million   of AgVantage securities; 
                
    purchased   $282.7 million   of newly originated Farm   Ranch loans; 
                
    added   $155.7 million   of Farm   Ranch loans under LTSPCs; 
                
    purchased   $87.3 million   of USDA Securities;  
                
    issued   $31.9 million   of Farmer Mac Guaranteed USDA Securities; and 
                
    purchased   $20.0 million   of Rural Utilities loans. 
       
  Farmer Mac's outstanding business volume was   $17.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $131.2 million   from   June 30, 2016  .  The increase in Farmer Mac's outstanding business volume was driven by net portfolio growth of Farm   Ranch loans and USDA Securities.  The new business volume in the Institutional Credit line of business included the purchase of a $500.0 million AgVantage security from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("MetLife")  and the purchase of $16.0 million under Farm Equity AgVantage facilities with agricultural real estate investment funds.  MetLife used the proceeds from Farmer Mac's purchase of the $500 million AgVantage security to refinance an AgVantage security of the same amount that matured in third quarter 2016.

     Table of Contents  

The following table sets forth purchases of non-delinquent eligible loans, new loans added under LTSPCs, and new guarantees during the periods indicated in the Farm   Ranch, USDA Guarantees, and Rural Utilities lines of business, as well as purchases of AgVantage securities in the Institutional Credit line of business:   
    
  Table 9 

New business volume for loans within the Farm   Ranch line of business for the first nine months of 2016 was substantially greater than the first nine months of 2015. This is primarily due to an increase in borrower demand for long-term real estate financing, as farmers utilize equity in farmland assets to increase sources of operating capital, as well as increases in Farmer Mac's new customer base and the average size of loans purchased.  New business volume for LTSPCs within the Farm   Ranch line of business for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflected a modest increase in demand among Farm Credit System institutions for the LTSPC product.  The increase in new business volume in the USDA Guarantees line of business for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 reflected an increase in lender usage of USDA guaranteed loan programs due to available federal funding for such programs.  Loan purchase volume in the Rural Utilities line of business remained low due to modest demand for credit associated with slow economic growth and greater energy efficiency in recent years, as well as an ongoing preference by CFC, Farmer Mac's only current rural utilities cooperative counterparty, to retain loans on its balance sheet.  The large LTSPC transaction completed with CFC in second quarter 2016 marked the second time Farmer Mac has added loans under LTSPCs in the Rural Utilities line of business.  Changes in AgVantage securities volume are primarily driven by the generally larger transaction sizes for that product and the fluctuating funding and liquidity needs of Farmer Mac's customer network and scheduled maturity amounts, which was reflected by the refinancing of a $500.0 million AgVantage security during third quarter 2016.   
    
  Based on market conditions, Farmer Mac either retains the loans it purchases or securitizes them and retains or sells Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities backed by those loans.  The weighted-average age of the Farm   Ranch non-delinquent eligible loans purchased and retained (excluding the purchases of defaulted loans) during   third quarter     2016   and   third quarter     2015   was   less than one year  .  Of those loans,  

75 

     Table of Contents  

82 percent   and   71 percent  , respectively, had principal amortization periods longer than the maturity date, resulting in balloon payments at maturity, with a weighted-average remaining term to maturity of   18.2   years and   18.8   years, respectively. 
    
  During   third quarter     2016   and   2015  , Farmer Mac securitized some of the Farm   Ranch loans it had purchased and sold the resulting Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities in the amounts of   $147.1 million   and   $118.8 million  , respectively.  Farmer Mac consolidates these loans and presents them as "Loans held for investment in consolidated trusts, at amortized cost" on the consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $81.9 million   and   $231.4 million  , respectively, of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities were sold to Zions First National Bank, which is a related party to Farmer Mac, compared to   $83.1 million   and   $166.7 million   of sales for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

    As of both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, this facility had not been utilized.  Farmer Mac receives a fixed fee based on the full dollar amount of the facility.  If the counterparty draws on the facility, the amounts drawn will be presented as AgVantage Securities, and Farmer Mac will earn interest income on those securities.

The following table summarizes by maturity date the scheduled principal amortization of loans held, loans underlying off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities (excluding AgVantage securities) and LTSPCs, USDA Securities, and Farmer Mac Guaranteed USDA Securities as of   September 30, 2016  : 
    
  Table 12  

Of the   $17.2 billion   outstanding principal balance of volume included in Farmer Mac's four lines of business as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $7.4 billion   were AgVantage securities included in the Institutional Credit line of business.  Unlike business volume in the form of purchased loans, USDA Securities, and loans underlying LTSPCs and non-AgVantage Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, most AgVantage securities do not require periodic payments of principal based on amortization schedules and instead have fixed maturity dates when the secured general obligation is due.  The following table summarizes by maturity date the outstanding principal amount of both on- and off-balance sheet AgVantage securities as of   September 30, 2016  :

    Includes the expiration of the $300.0 million revolving floating rate AgVantage facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , this facility had not been utilized. 
        
  The weighted-average remaining maturity of the outstanding AgVantage securities shown in the table above was   4.0   years as of   September 30, 2016  .  As a general matter, if maturing AgVantage securities are not replaced with new AgVantage securities, either from the same issuer or from new business, or if the  

78 

     Table of Contents  

spread earned by Farmer Mac on new AgVantage securities that replace maturing AgVantage securities is lower than the spread earned on the maturing securities, Farmer Mac's income could be adversely affected. 
    
  As part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations for Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities and commitments to purchase eligible loans underlying LTSPCs, Farmer Mac purchases defaulted loans, all of which are at least 90-days delinquent or in material non-monetary default at the time of purchase, out of the loan pools underlying those securities and LTSPCs, and records the purchased loans as such on its balance sheet.  The purchase price for a defaulted loan purchased out of a pool of loans backing Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities is the then-current outstanding principal balance of the loan plus accrued and unpaid interest.  The purchase price for a defaulted loan purchased under an LTSPC is the then-current outstanding principal balance of the loan, with accrued and unpaid interest on the defaulted loan payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation proceeds as received.  The purchase price of a defaulted loan is not an indicator of the expected loss on that loan; many other factors affect expected loss, if any, on any loan so purchased.  The delinquent loans purchased out of securitized pools and LTSPCs during third quarter 2016 had a weighted average age of   9 years  .  The delinquent loans purchased out of securitized pools and LTSPCs during third quarter 2015 had a weighted-average age of   7 years  . See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk   Loans and Guarantees." 
    
  The following table presents Farmer Mac's purchases of defaulted loans underlying Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs for the periods indicated: 
    
  Table 14  

Outlook     
    
  Farmer Mac continues to provide a stable source of liquidity, capital, and risk management tools as the secondary market that helps meet the financing needs of rural America.  While the pace of Farmer Mac's growth will depend on the capital and liquidity needs of the participants in the rural financing business, Farmer Mac foresees opportunities for continued growth.  More specifically, Farmer Mac believes that its Farm   Ranch, USDA Guarantees, Rural Utilities, and Institutional Credit lines of business all have opportunities for growth, driven by several key factors: 

As agricultural and rural utilities lenders face increased equity capital requirements under new regulatory frameworks or rating agency requirements, or seek to reduce exposure due to lending limits or concentration limits, Farmer Mac can provide relief for those institutions through loan purchases, guarantees, or LTSPCs. 
                
    While lending opportunities in the rural utilities industry remain stable, growth opportunities within Farmer Mac's Institutional Credit line of business exist because it provides a competitive source of debt funding for rural utilities cooperative lenders. 

79 

     Table of Contents  

As a result of targeted marketing and product development efforts, Farmer Mac's lender network and Institutional Credit customer base continues to expand, which may generate additional demand for Farmer Mac's products from new sources. 
       
  Farmer Mac believes that these growth opportunities will be important in replacing income earned on the loans and other assets as they mature, pay down, or are reinvested at potentially lower spreads. 
    
  Agricultural Industry  .  The agricultural industry includes many diverse sectors that respond in different ways to changes in economic conditions.  Those individual sectors often are affected differently, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively, by prevailing domestic and global economic factors and regional weather conditions.  This results in cycles where one or more sectors may be under stress at the same time that others are not.  The profitability of agricultural sectors is also affected by commodity inventories and their associated market prices, which can vary largely as a result of global production trends, weather patterns, access to water supply, and harvest conditions that may affect both domestic and global supplies.  The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other worldwide currencies, combined with a slowdown in global economic growth, could also continue to adversely affect the demand for certain U.S. agricultural exports, which may result in producers receiving lower commodity prices.  
    
  Farmland values have declined recently in some regions, primarily in the Midwest, in response to declining commodity prices.  However, Farmer Mac believes that its portfolio remains sufficiently diversified, both geographically and by commodity, and that its portfolio has generally demonstrated historically high credit quality and low delinquency rates to endure reasonably foreseeable volatility in farmland values and commodity prices.  Farmer Mac also continues to closely monitor sector profitability, economic conditions, and agricultural land value and geographic trends to tailor underwriting practices to changing conditions.  For more information about the loan balances and loan-to-value ratios for Farm   Ranch loans in Farmer Mac's portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  , see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk   Loans and Guarantees." 
    
  The western part of the United States, and in particular California, continues to experience drought conditions to varying degrees.  Although Farmer Mac has not observed any material effect on its portfolio from the drought through September 30, 2016, the persistence of drought conditions in certain areas of the west could have an adverse effect on Farmer Mac s delinquency rates or loss experience.  Through regular discussions with its loan servicers and lenders and their customers, Farmer Mac continues to remain informed about the drought conditions and their effects in those areas. 
    
  Farmer Mac's marketing efforts directed towards the Farm   Ranch line of business focus on lenders that have demonstrated a commitment to agricultural lending based on their lending history.  Farmer Mac directs its outreach efforts to these lenders through direct personal contact, which is facilitated through Farmer Mac's frequent participation in state and national banking conferences, its alliances with the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America, and its business relationships with members of the Farm Credit System.  In the Farm   Ranch line of business, Farmer Mac has experienced continuing stable demand for its loan products.  Demand for Farmer Mac's secondary market tools could also increase as rural lenders adapt to new and changing regulations, which may require lenders to obtain more liquidity and capital to continue their lending practices. 
    
  Farmer Mac also directs marketing efforts towards the agricultural industry by trying to identify and develop relationships with potential issuers of AgVantage securities, including insurance company  

80 

     Table of Contents  

agricultural lenders, who can pledge loans as collateral to obtain financing as part of Farmer Mac's Institutional Credit line of business.  As part of these efforts, Farmer Mac has recently increased its focus on wholesale financing for institutional investors in agricultural assets that qualify as eligible collateral under Farmer Mac's charter.  In July 2014, Farmer Mac expanded its AgVantage product to this new type of issuer and refers to this product variation as the Farm Equity AgVantage product.  Farmer Mac directs its outreach efforts to these potential issuers through its business relationships within the agricultural community and through executive outreach to institutions whose profile presents opportunity to benefit from wholesale financing.  As institutional investment in agricultural assets continues to grow, Farmer Mac believes that it is in a unique position to help increase access to capital for these types of counterparties and thereby provide a new source of capital to benefit rural America.  Farmer Mac designed the Farm Equity AgVantage product to provide an efficient, low-cost source of financing tailored to meet the needs of institutional investors that can be adapted to many different types of organizational structures and for both public and private institutional investors.  Although this product is still in the early stages of development, Farmer Mac believes there is opportunity to expand this type of business as both the trend toward institutional investment in agricultural assets and awareness of the Farm Equity AgVantage product continue to grow.      For more information about the Farm Equity AgVantage product, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk   Institutional" in this report and "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Institutional Credit" in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016. 
    
  Rural Utilities Industry  .  The rural utilities industry may experience increased needs for financing in the future to make improvements in response to environmental and clean energy policies.  However, demand for capital within the rural utilities industry currently remains moderate, which has resulted in an ongoing high level of competition between rural utilities cooperative lenders that could suppress loan growth opportunities for those lenders, including lenders that participate in Farmer Mac's Rural Utilities line of business.  Although competitive pressures remain within the rural utilities lending industry, Farmer Mac sees opportunities for growth in this area within Farmer Mac's Institutional Credit line of business because the wholesale funding rates that Farmer Mac provides may be highly competitive compared to other available sources of debt funding for rural utilities cooperative lenders.  

Balance Sheet Review 
    
  Assets  .  Farmer Mac's total assets as of   September 30, 2016   were   $16.0 billion  , compared to   $15.5 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to an increase in total Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and total loans, net of allowance, offset in part by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had   $0.3 billion   of cash and cash equivalents and   $3.0 billion   of investment securities, compared to   $1.2 billion   of cash and cash equivalents and   $2.8 billion   of investment securities as of   December 31, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had   $6.1 billion   of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,   $4.3 billion   of loans, net of allowance, and   $2.0 billion   of USDA Securities.  This compares to   $5.4 billion   of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,   $4.0 billion   of loans, net of allowance, and   $1.9 billion   of USDA Securities as of   December 31, 2015  .

Liabilities  .  Farmer Mac's total liabilities   increased   to   $15.4 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $15.0 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The   increase   in liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in debt securities of consolidated trusts held by third parties.  
    
  Equity  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had total equity of   $600.9 million  , comprised of stockholders' equity of   $600.7 million   and non-controlling interest of   $0.2 million   related to Farmer Mac's appraisal subsidiary, AgVisory.  As of   December 31, 2015  , Farmer Mac had total equity of   $553.7 million  , comprised of stockholders' equity of   $553.5 million   and non-controlling interest of   $0.2 million  .  The increase in total equity was a result of an increase in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.  The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income was due to increases in fair value on certain fixed-rate USDA Securities offset in part by decreases in fair value on cash flow hedges as long-term market interest rates declined during the first nine months of 2016.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
    
  Farmer Mac offers approved lenders two credit enhancement alternatives to increase their liquidity or lending capacity while retaining the cash flow benefits of their loans: (1) Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, which are available through each of the Farm   Ranch, USDA Guarantees, Rural Utilities, and Institutional Credit lines of business; and (2) LTSPCs, which are available through the Farm   Ranch and Rural Utilities lines of business.  For securitization trusts where Farmer Mac is the primary beneficiary, the trust assets and liabilities are included on Farmer Mac's consolidated balance sheet.  For the remainder of these transactions, and in the event of deconsolidation, both of these alternatives result in the creation of off-balance sheet obligations for Farmer Mac.  See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about consolidation and Farmer Mac's off-balance sheet business activities.

Risk Management 

Credit Risk   Loans and Guarantees  .    Farmer Mac is exposed to credit risk resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their loans in conjunction with a deficiency in the value of the collateral relative to the outstanding balance of the loan and the costs of liquidation.  Farmer Mac is exposed to credit risk on: 

loans held; 
                
    loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities; and 
                
    loans underlying LTSPCs. 
       
  Farmer Mac generally assumes 100 percent of the credit risk on loans held, loans underlying LTSPCs in the Farm   Ranch and Rural Utilities lines of business, and Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities in the Farm   Ranch line of business.  Farmer Mac has direct credit exposure to loans in non-AgVantage transactions and indirect credit exposure to loans that secure AgVantage transactions because AgVantage securities represent a general obligation of an issuer that is, in turn, secured by eligible loans.  The credit exposure of Farmer Mac and Farmer Mac II LLC on USDA Securities, including those underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed USDA Securities, is covered by the full faith and credit of the United States.  Therefore, Farmer Mac believes that Farmer Mac and Farmer Mac II LLC have little or no credit risk exposure in the USDA Guarantees line of business because of the USDA guarantee.  As of   September 30, 2016  , neither Farmer Mac nor Farmer Mac II LLC had experienced any credit losses on any business under the USDA Guarantees line of business, and neither expects to incur any such losses in the future. 
    
  Farmer Mac has established underwriting, collateral valuation, and documentation standards for agricultural real estate mortgage loans and rural utilities loans.  Farmer Mac believes that these standards mitigate the risk of loss from borrower defaults and provide guidance about the management, administration, and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all participating and potential lenders.  These standards were developed based on industry practices for agricultural real estate mortgage loans and rural utilities loans and are designed to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower, as well as the value of the collateral securing the loan.  Farmer Mac evaluates and adjusts these standards on an ongoing basis based on current and anticipated market conditions.  For more information about Farmer Mac's underwriting and collateral valuation standards, see "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Farm   Ranch Underwriting and Collateral Valuation (Appraisal) Standards" and "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Rural Utilities Underwriting" in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016. 
    
  Farmer Mac requires approved lenders to make representations and warranties regarding the conformity of eligible agricultural mortgage and rural utilities loans to Farmer Mac's standards, the accuracy of loan data provided to Farmer Mac, and other requirements related to the loans.  Sellers are responsible to Farmer Mac for breaches of those representations and warranties, and Farmer Mac has the ability to require a seller to cure, replace, or repurchase a loan sold or transferred to Farmer Mac if any breach of a representation or warranty is discovered that was material to Farmer Mac's decision to purchase the loan or that directly or indirectly causes a default or potential loss on a loan sold or transferred by the seller to Farmer Mac. During third quarter 2016, Farmer Mac did not require any seller to cure or repurchase a loan purchased by Farmer Mac for breach of a representation or warranty.  During the previous three years as of September 30, 2016, Farmer Mac had required one seller to repurchase a total of two loans aggregating $0.8 million for breaches of representations and warranties made about those two loans, both  

83 

     Table of Contents  

of which repurchases occurred during first quarter 2016.  In addition to relying on the representations and warranties of lenders, Farmer Mac also underwrites all of the agricultural mortgage loans (other than rural housing and part-time farm mortgage loans) and rural utilities loans that it holds in its portfolio.  For rural housing and part-time farm mortgage loans, Farmer Mac relies on representations and warranties from the seller that those loans conform to Farmer Mac's specified underwriting criteria without exception.  For more information about Farmer Mac's loan eligibility requirements, see "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Farm   Ranch Loan Eligibility" and "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Rural Utilities Loan Eligibility" in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016. 
    
  Under contracts with Farmer Mac and in consideration for servicing fees, Farmer Mac-approved central servicers service loans in accordance with Farmer Mac's requirements.  Central servicers are responsible to Farmer Mac for serious errors in the servicing of those loans.  If a central servicer materially breaches the terms of its servicing agreement with Farmer Mac, such as failing to forward payments received or releasing collateral without Farmer Mac's consent, or experiences insolvency or bankruptcy, Farmer Mac has the right to terminate the servicing relationship for a particular loan or the entire portfolio serviced by the central servicer.  In addition, Farmer Mac can proceed against the central servicer in arbitration or exercise any remedies available to it under law.  In the last three years, Farmer Mac has not exercised any remedies or taken any formal action against any central servicers.  For more information about Farmer Mac's servicing requirements, see "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Farm   Ranch Servicing" and "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Rural Utilities Servicing" in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016. 
    
  Farmer Mac's AgVantage securities are general obligations of institutions approved by Farmer Mac and are secured by eligible loans in an amount at least equal to the outstanding principal amount of the security.   Farmer Mac excludes the loans that secure AgVantage securities from the credit risk metrics it discloses because Farmer Mac has only indirect credit risk on those loans and because of the other characteristics of AgVantage securities that mitigate credit risk.  Those characteristics include a general obligation of an issuing institution approved by Farmer Mac, the required collateralization level for the securities, the requirement for delinquent loans to be removed from the pool of pledged loans and replaced with current eligible loans, and in some cases, the requirement for the counterparty to comply with specified financial covenants for the life of the related AgVantage security.  As such, all AgVantage securities are secured by current loans representing at least 100 percent of the outstanding amount of these securities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had not experienced any credit losses on any AgVantage securities and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk   Institutional" for more information about Farmer Mac's credit risk on AgVantage securities. 
    
  Farmer Mac has developed different underwriting standards for rural utilities loans that depend on whether direct or indirect credit exposure is assumed on a loan and whether the borrower is an electric distribution cooperative or a G T cooperative.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no delinquencies in Farmer Mac's portfolio of rural utilities loans, and Farmer Mac has not experienced any credit losses on rural utilities loans since Congress authorized Farmer Mac's Rural Utilities line of business in 2008.  Based on this performance, Farmer Mac excludes the loans in the Rural Utilities line of business from the credit risk metrics it discloses.  Farmer Mac's direct credit exposure to rural utilities loans and loans underlying LTSPCs as of   September 30, 2016   was   $1.9 billion   across 38 states, of which   $1.5 billion   were loans to electric distribution cooperatives and   $0.4 billion   were loans to G T cooperatives.  Farmer Mac also had indirect credit exposure to the rural utilities loans securing AgVantage securities and

     Table of Contents  

included in the Institutional Credit line of business, some of which are loans to G T cooperatives.  For more information, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk   Institutional." 
    
  Farmer Mac maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover estimated probable losses on loans held and a reserve for losses to cover estimated probable losses on loans underlying LTSPCs and off-balance sheet Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities (excluding AgVantage securities).  The methodology that Farmer Mac uses to determine the level of its allowance for losses is described in Note 2(j) to the consolidated financial statements included in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016.  Management believes that this methodology produces a reasonable estimate of probable losses, as of the balance sheet date, for all loans held and loans underlying off-balance sheet Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities (excluding AgVantage securities) and LTSPCs. 
    
  The following table summarizes the components of Farmer Mac's total allowance for losses for the three and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 
    
  Table 15  

Activity affecting the allowance for loan losses and reserve for losses is discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Provision for and Release of Allowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Losses."  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac's allowances for losses totaled   $6.9 million  , or   12   basis points of the outstanding principal balance of loans held for investment and loans underlying LTSPCs and off-balance sheet Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities (excluding AgVantage securities), compared to   $6.6 million  , or   11   basis points, as of   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Farmer Mac's 90-day delinquency measure includes loans 90 days or more past due, as well as loans in foreclosure and non-performing loans where the borrower is in bankruptcy.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac's 90-day delinquencies were   $18.4 million   (  0.31 percent   of the Farm   Ranch portfolio), compared to   $32.1 million   (  0.56 percent   of the Farm   Ranch portfolio) as of   December 31, 2015   and   $36.7 million   (  0.67 percent   of the Farm   Ranch portfolio) as of   September 30, 2015  .  Those 90-day delinquencies were comprised of   50   delinquent loans as of   September 30, 2016  , compared with   35    

85 

     Table of Contents  

delinquent loans as of December 31, 2015 and   37   delinquent loans as of   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in Farmer Mac's 90-day delinquencies as a percentage of its Farm   Ranch portfolio from year-end primarily related to (1) the workout in January 2016 of two Agricultural Storage and Processing loans that financed one canola facility and (2)  Farmer Mac's receipt of $6.0 million to pay off two long-standing delinquent timber loans with the same borrower.  Farmer Mac's 90-day delinquencies have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter, both in dollars and as a percentage of the outstanding Farm   Ranch portfolio, with higher levels generally observed at the end of the first and third quarters of each year, which corresponds with the annual (January 1st) and semi-annual (January 1st and July 1st) payment characteristics of most Farm   Ranch loans.  Farmer Mac expects that over time its 90-day delinquency rate will eventually revert closer to Farmer Mac's historical averages due to macroeconomic and other potential factors, but Farmer Mac has not yet seen an impact on its portfolio or a rise in delinquencies related to these factors.  Farmer Mac's average 90-day delinquency rate for the Farm   Ranch line of business over the last fifteen years is approximately 1 percent.  
    
  The following table presents historical information regarding Farmer Mac's 90-day delinquencies in the Farm   Ranch line of business compared to the principal balance of all Farm   Ranch loans held and loans underlying off-balance sheet Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities (excluding AgVantage securities) and LTSPCs: 
    
  Table 16 

When analyzing the overall risk profile of its lines of business, Farmer Mac takes into account more than the Farm   Ranch loan delinquency percentages provided above.  The lines of business also include AgVantage securities and Rural Utilities loans held and underlying LTSPCs, neither of which have any delinquencies, and USDA Securities, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.  Across all of Farmer Mac's lines of business, 90-day delinquencies represented   0.11 percent   of total outstanding business volume as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.20 percent   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac individually evaluated   $22.4 million   of the   $77.9 million   of recorded investment in impaired loans for collateral shortfalls against updated appraised values, other updated collateral valuations, or discounted values.  For the remaining   $55.5 million   of impaired assets for which updated valuations were not available, Farmer Mac evaluated them in the aggregate in consideration of their similar risk characteristics and historical statistics.  Farmer Mac recorded specific allowances of   $2.0 million   for undercollateralized assets as of   September 30, 2016  .  Farmer Mac's general allowances were   $4.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .

Loans in the Farm   Ranch line of business are all secured by first liens on agricultural real estate.  Accordingly, Farmer Mac's exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between (1) the total of the accrued interest, advances, and the principal balance of a loan and (2) the value of the property less the cost to sell.  Measurement of that excess or shortfall is the best predictor and determinant of loss, compared to other measures that evaluate the efficiency of a particular farm operator.  Debt service ratios depend upon farm operator efficiency and leverage, which can vary widely within a geographic region, commodity type, or an operator's business and farming skills.  A loan's original loan-to-value ratio is one of many factors Farmer Mac considers in evaluating loss severity and is calculated by dividing the loan principal balance at the time of guarantee, purchase, or commitment by the appraised value at the date of loan origination or, when available, updated appraised value at the time of guarantee, purchase, or commitment.  Other factors include, but are not limited to, other underwriting standards, commodity and farming forecasts, and regional economic and agricultural conditions. 
    
  Loan-to-value ratios depend upon the market value of a property, as determined in accordance with Farmer Mac's collateral valuation standards.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the average unpaid loan balance for loans outstanding in the Farm   Ranch line of business was   $605,000   and   $602,000  , respectively.  The original loan-to-value ratio is based on the original appraised value that has not been indexed to provide a current market value or reflect amortization of loans.  The weighted average original loan-to-value ratio for Farm   Ranch loans purchased during third quarter 2016 was   46 percent  , compared to   48 percent   for loans purchased in the same period for 2015.  The weighted average original loan-to-value ratio for all Farm   Ranch loans held and all loans underlying off-balance sheet Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities (excluding AgVantage securities) and LTSPCs was approximately   46 percent   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The weighted-average original loan-to-value ratio for all 90-day delinquencies was   44 percent   and   45 percent  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The weighted average current loan-to-value ratio, which is the loan-to-value ratio based on original appraised value but which reflects loan amortization since purchase, for Farm   Ranch loans held and loans underlying off-balance sheet Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities (excluding AgVantage securities) and LTSPCs was approximately   44 percent   as of both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

The following table presents Farmer Mac's cumulative net credit losses relative to the cumulative original balance for all Farm   Ranch loans purchased and loans underlying LTSPCs and off-balance sheet Farm   Ranch Guaranteed Securities (excluding AgVantage securities) as of   September 30, 2016   by year of origination, geographic region, and commodity/collateral type.  The purpose of this information is to present information regarding losses relative to original Farm   Ranch purchases, guarantees, and commitments.

Analysis of portfolio performance indicates that commodity type is the primary determinant of Farmer Mac's exposure to loss on a given loan.  Within most commodity groups, certain geographic areas allow greater economies of scale or proximity to markets than others and, consequently, may result in more successful operations within the commodity group.  Certain geographic areas also offer better growing conditions and market access than others and, consequently, may result in more versatile and more successful operators within a given commodity group.  Farmer Mac's board of directors has established  

89 

     Table of Contents  

policies regarding geographic and commodity concentration to maintain adequate diversification and measure concentration risk.   
    
  However, in Farmer Mac's experience, the degree to which the collateral for a commodity group is single-use or highly improved is a more significant determinant of the probability of ultimate losses on a given loan than diversity of geographic location within a commodity group.  Commodity groups that tend to be single-use or highly improved include permanent plantings (for example, nut crops), agricultural storage and processing facilities (for example, canola plants and grain processing facilities), and certain livestock facilities (for example, dairy facilities).  The versatility of a borrower's operation (and in the case of persisting adverse economic conditions, the borrower's ability to switch commodity groups) will more likely result in profitability for the borrower and, consequently, a lower risk of decreased value for the underlying collateral.  Producers of agricultural commodities that require highly improved property are generally less able to adapt their operations when faced with adverse economic conditions.  In addition, in the event of a borrower's default, the prospective sale value of the collateral is more likely to decrease and the related loan may become undercollateralized.  This analysis is consistent with corresponding commodity analyses, which indicate that Farmer Mac has experienced higher loss and collateral deficiency rates in permanent planting loans and agricultural storage and processing loans, for which the collateral is typically highly improved and specialized.

Farmer Mac regularly conducts detailed, statistical stress tests of its portfolio for credit risk and compares those results to current and historical credit quality metrics and to the various statutory, regulatory, and Farmer Mac's board of directors' capital policy metrics.  Farmer Mac's methodologies for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees, managing credit risk, and providing adequate allowances for losses consider all of the foregoing factors and information. 

Credit Risk   Institutional  .  Farmer Mac is exposed to credit risk arising from its business relationships with other institutions including: 

issuers of AgVantage securities; 
                
    approved lenders and servicers; and 
                
    interest rate swap counterparties. 
       
  Farmer Mac approves AgVantage counterparties and manages institutional credit risk related to those AgVantage counterparties by requiring them to meet Farmer Mac's standards for creditworthiness for the particular counterparty and transaction.  The required collateralization level is established at the time the AgVantage facility is entered into with the counterparty and does not change during the life of the AgVantage securities issued under such facility.  In AgVantage transactions, the corporate obligor is  

92 

     Table of Contents  

required to remove from the pool of pledged collateral any loan that becomes more than 30 days delinquent in the payment of principal or interest and to substitute an eligible loan that is current in payment to maintain the minimum required collateralization level.  In the event of a default on the general obligation, Farmer Mac would have recourse to the pledged collateral and have rights to the ongoing borrower payments of principal and interest.  For Farm Equity AgVantage counterparties, Farmer Mac also requires that the counterparty generally (1) maintain a higher collateralization level, through lower loan-to-value ratio thresholds and higher overcollateralization than required for traditional AgVantage securities and (2) comply with specified financial covenants for the life of the related Farm Equity AgVantage security to avoid default. For a more detailed description of AgVantage securities, see "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Institutional Credit AgVantage Securities" in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016. 
    
  The unpaid principal balance of outstanding on-balance sheet AgVantage securities secured by loans eligible for the Farm   Ranch line of business totaled   $3.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $3.4 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The unpaid principal balance of on-balance sheet AgVantage securities secured by loans eligible for the Rural Utilities line of business totaled   $2.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $2.1 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  In addition, the unpaid principal balance of outstanding off-balance sheet AgVantage transactions totaled   $1.3 billion   as of both   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  .   
    
  The following table provides information about the issuers of AgVantage securities, as well as the required collateralization levels for those transactions as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  : 
    
  Table 21

    Includes $300.0 million related to a revolving floating rate AgVantage facility.  Farmer Mac receives a fixed fee based on the full dollar amount of the facility.  This facility had not been drawn upon as of either   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
          
  Farmer Mac manages institutional credit risk related to lenders and servicers by requiring those institutions to meet Farmer Mac's standards for creditworthiness.  Farmer Mac monitors the financial condition of those institutions by evaluating financial statements and bank credit rating agency reports.  For more information about Farmer Mac's lender eligibility requirements, see "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Farm   Ranch Approved Lenders" and "Business Farmer Mac Lines of Business Rural Utilities Approved Lenders" in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016.

Farmer Mac manages institutional credit risk related to its interest rate swap counterparties through collateralization provisions contained in each of its swap agreements that varies based on the market value of its swaps portfolio with each counterparty.  Furthermore, new rules jointly issued by various prudential regulators, including the FCA, establish minimum requirements for the exchange of initial and variation margin between Farmer Mac and its swap dealer counterparties in non-cleared swaps transactions.  Farmer Mac will be required to comply with some of these requirements by March 1, 2017.  In addition, Farmer Mac transacts interest rate swaps with multiple counterparties to ensure a more even distribution of institutional credit risk related to its swap transactions.  As a result of mandatory clearing rules for certain interest rate derivative transactions enacted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), Farmer Mac uses the clearing process for cleared swap transactions as another mechanism for managing its derivative counterparty risk.  Credit risk related to interest rate swap contracts is discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Interest Rate Risk" and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Credit Risk           Other Investments  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had   $0.3 billion   of cash and cash equivalents and   $3.0 billion   of investment securities.  The management of the credit risk inherent in these investments is governed by Farmer Mac's internal policies as well as FCA regulations, which establish limitations on dollar amount, issuer concentration, and credit quality.  Those regulations can be found at 12 C.F.R.    652.1-652.45 (the "Liquidity and Investment Regulations").  In addition to establishing a portfolio of highly liquid investments as an available source of cash, the goals of Farmer Mac's investment policies are designed to minimize Farmer Mac's exposure to financial market volatility, preserve capital, and support Farmer Mac's access to the debt markets.  
    
  The Liquidity and Investment Regulations and Farmer Mac's policies generally require each investment or issuer of an investment to be highly rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO").  Investments in mortgage securities and asset-backed securities are required to have a rating in the highest NRSRO category.  Corporate debt securities with maturities of no more than five years but more than three years are required to be rated in one of the two highest categories; corporate debt securities with maturities of three years or less are required to be rated in one of the three highest categories.  Some investments do not require a rating, such as U.S. Treasury securities and other obligations fully insured by the United States government or a government agency or diversified investment funds regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Investments in diversified investment funds are further limited to those funds that are holding only instruments approved for direct investment by Farmer Mac.   
    
  The Liquidity and Investment Regulations and Farmer Mac's policies also establish concentration limits, which are intended to limit exposure to any one counterparty.  The Liquidity and Investment Regulations limit Farmer Mac's total credit exposure to any single issuer of securities and uncollateralized financial derivatives to 25 percent of Farmer Mac's regulatory capital (as of   September 30, 2016  , 25 percent of Farmer Mac's regulatory capital was   $148.5 million  ), though Farmer Mac's current policy, for any investments made after the effective date of this policy, limits this total credit exposure to 5 percent of its regulatory capital (as of   September 30, 2016  , 5 percent of Farmer Mac's regulatory capital was   $29.7 million  ).  These exposure limits do not apply to obligations of the United States or GSEs, though Farmer Mac is restricted by the Liquidity and Investment Regulations and its own policy from investing more than 100 percent of its regulatory capital in any one GSE.

On February 23, 2016, FCA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register to amend the Liquidity and Investment Regulations to comply with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act by removing references and requirements relating to credit ratings and replacing them with other standards of creditworthiness, as well as to revise the eligibility criteria and exposure limits for certain types of investments.  Farmer Mac submitted comments on this proposed rule to FCA on April 25, 2016.  Farmer Mac expects that it will be able to successfully adapt to FCA's proposed amendments of the Liquidity and Investment Regulations. 

Interest Rate Risk  .  Farmer Mac is subject to interest rate risk on all assets retained on its balance sheet  because of possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to loans held, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, and USDA Securities due to the ability of borrowers to prepay their loans before the scheduled maturities, thereby increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow mismatches.  Cash flow mismatches in a changing interest rate environment can reduce the earnings of Farmer Mac if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding costs cannot be correspondingly reduced, or if assets repay more slowly than expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.  As discussed below, Farmer Mac manages this interest rate risk by funding assets purchased with liabilities matching the duration and cash flow characteristics of the assets purchased. 
    
  The goal of interest rate risk management at Farmer Mac is to create and maintain a portfolio that generates stable earnings and value across a variety of interest rate environments.  Farmer Mac's primary strategy for managing interest rate risk is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar duration and cash flow characteristics so that they will perform similarly as interest rates change.  To match these characteristics, Farmer Mac issues discount notes and both callable and non-callable medium-term notes across a spectrum of maturities.  Farmer Mac issues callable debt to offset the prepayment risk associated with some loans.  By using a blend of liabilities that includes callable debt, the interest rate sensitivities of the liabilities tend to increase or decrease as interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the interest rate sensitivities of the assets.  Farmer Mac also uses financial derivatives to better match the durations of Farmer Mac's assets and liabilities, thereby reducing overall interest rate sensitivity. 
    
  Taking into consideration the prepayment provisions and the default probabilities associated with its loan assets, Farmer Mac uses prepayment models to project and value cash flows associated with these assets.  Because borrowers' behaviors in various interest rate environments may change over time, Farmer Mac periodically evaluates the effectiveness of these models compared to actual prepayment experience and adjusts and refines the models as necessary to improve the precision of subsequent prepayment forecasts. 
    
  In certain cases, yield maintenance provisions and other prepayment penalties contained in agricultural mortgage loans and rural utilities loans reduce, but do not eliminate, prepayment risk.  Those provisions require borrowers to make an additional payment when they prepay their loans, thus compensating Farmer Mac for the shortened duration of the prepaid loan.  As of   September 30, 2016  , less than   1 percent   of the total outstanding balance of loans in the Farm   Ranch line of business where Farmer Mac either owned the loan or the beneficial interest in the underlying loan had yield maintenance provisions or other forms of prepayment protection (together covering   2 percent   of all loans with fixed interest rates).  Of the Farm   Ranch loans purchased in third quarter   2016  ,   none   had yield maintenance or another form of prepayment protection.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   none   of Farmer Mac's USDA Securities had yield maintenance provisions; however,   4 percent   contained other prepayment penalties.  Of the USDA Securities purchased in third quarter   2016  ,   5 percent   contained various forms of prepayment penalties.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   61 percent   of the Rural Utilities loans owned by Farmer Mac had yield

     Table of Contents  

maintenance provisions.  Of the Rural Utilities loans purchased in third quarter   2016  ,   100 percent   contained prepayment penalties.  
    
  Farmer Mac's purchases of eligible loan assets expose Farmer Mac to interest rate risk arising primarily from uncertainty as to when the borrowers will repay the outstanding principal balance on the related loans.  Generally, the values of Farmer Mac's eligible loan assets, and the debt issued to fund these assets, increase when interest rates decline, and their values decrease as interest rates rise.  Furthermore, changes in interest rates may affect loan prepayment rates which may, in turn, affect durations and values of the loans.  Declining interest rates generally increase prepayment rates, which shortens the duration of these assets, while rising interest rates tend to slow loan prepayments, thereby extending the duration of the loans.  
    
  Farmer Mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans that Farmer Mac has committed to acquire (other than delinquent loans through LTSPCs) but has not yet purchased.  When Farmer Mac commits to purchase those loans, it is exposed to interest rate risk between the time it commits to purchase the loans and the time it either: 

sells Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities backed by the loans; or 
                
    issues debt to retain the loans in its portfolio. 
       
  Farmer Mac manages the interest rate risk related to these loans, and any related Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities or debt issuance, through the use of forward sale contracts on the debt securities of other GSEs and futures contracts involving U.S. Treasury securities.  Farmer Mac uses forward sale contracts on GSE securities to reduce its interest rate exposure to changes in both U.S. Treasury rates and spreads on Farmer Mac debt and certain Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities.  Issuing debt to fund the loans as investments does not fully eliminate interest rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities, as discussed above.   
    
  Farmer Mac's   $0.3 billion   of cash and cash equivalents mature within three months and are funded with discount notes having similar maturities.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $2.7 billion   of the $  3.0 billion   of investment securities (  90 percent  ) were floating rate securities with rates that adjust within one year or fixed rate securities with original maturities between three months and one year.  Those securities are funded with effectively floating rate debt that closely matches the rate adjustment dates of the associated investments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had outstanding discount notes of   $5.0 billion  , medium-term notes that mature within one year of   $4.3 billion  , and medium-term notes that mature after one year of   $4.8 billion  .  
    
  Recognizing that interest rate sensitivity may change with the passage of time and as interest rates change, Farmer Mac assesses this exposure on a regular basis and, if necessary, readjusts its portfolio of assets and liabilities by: 

purchasing assets in the ordinary course of business; 
                
    refinancing existing liabilities; or 
                
    using financial derivatives to alter the characteristics of existing assets or liabilities. 
       
  Farmer Mac regularly stress tests its portfolio for interest rate risk and uses a variety of metrics to quantify and manage its interest rate risk.  These metrics include sensitivity to interest rate movements of market value of equity ("MVE") and net interest income ("NII") as well as duration gap analysis.  MVE  

96 

     Table of Contents  

represents management's estimate of the present value of all future cash flows from on- and off-balance sheet assets, liabilities, and financial derivatives, discounted at current interest rates and appropriate spreads.  However, MVE is not indicative of the market value of Farmer Mac as a going concern because these market values are theoretical and do not reflect future business activities.  MVE sensitivity analysis is used to measure the degree to which the market values of Farmer Mac's assets and liabilities change for a given change in interest rates.  Because this analysis evaluates the impact of interest rate movements on the value of all future cash flows, this measure provides an evaluation of Farmer Mac's long-term interest rate risk.   
    
  Farmer Mac's NII is the difference between the yield on its interest-earning assets and its funding costs.  Farmer Mac's NII may be affected by changes in market interest rates resulting from timing differences between maturities and re-pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities.  The direction and magnitude of any such effect depends on the direction and magnitude of the change in interest rates as well as the composition of Farmer Mac's portfolio.  The NII forecast represents an estimate of the net interest income that Farmer Mac's current portfolio is expected to produce over a twelve-month horizon.  As a result, NII sensitivity statistics provide a short-term view of Farmer Mac's interest rate sensitivity.   
    
  Duration is a measure of a financial instrument's sensitivity to small changes in interest rates.  Duration gap is the difference between the estimated durations of Farmer Mac's assets and liabilities.  Because duration is a measure of market value sensitivity, duration gap summarizes the extent to which estimated market value sensitivities for assets and liabilities are matched.  Duration gap provides a relatively concise measure of the interest rate risk inherent in Farmer Mac's outstanding book of business. 
    
  A positive duration gap denotes that the duration of Farmer Mac's assets is greater than the duration of its liabilities.  A positive duration gap indicates that the market value of Farmer Mac's assets is more sensitive to small interest rate movements than is the market value of its liabilities.  Conversely, a negative duration gap indicates that Farmer Mac's assets are less sensitive to small interest rate movements than are its liabilities. 
    
  Each of the metrics is produced using asset/liability models and is derived based on management's best estimates of such factors as projected interest rates, interest rate volatility, and prepayment speeds.  Accordingly, these metrics should be understood as estimates rather than precise measurements.  In addition, actual results may differ to the extent there are material changes to Farmer Mac's portfolio or changes in strategies undertaken to mitigate unfavorable sensitivities to interest rate changes.

The following schedule summarizes the results of Farmer Mac's MVE and NII sensitivity analysis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   to an immediate and instantaneous uniform or "parallel" shift in the yield curve: 
    
  Table 22 

Farmer Mac's board of directors has established policies and procedures regarding MVE and NII sensitivity.  These policies include the measurement of MVE and NII sensitivity to more severe decreasing interest rate scenarios that are consistent in magnitude with the increasing interest rate scenarios.  However, given the low interest rate environment, such rate scenarios produce negative interest rates, and, as a result, do not produce results that are meaningful.  Consequently, Farmer Mac measures and reports MVE and NII sensitivity to a down 25 basis point interest rate shock. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac's effective duration gap was negative   3.4 months  , compared to negative   1.6 months   as of   December 31, 2015  .  During the first nine months of of 2016, long term interest rates decreased sharply.  This rate movement shortened the duration of Farmer Mac's mortgage assets relative to its liabilities, thereby widening slightly Farmer Mac's duration gap.  Farmer Mac's overall interest rate sensitivity remained relatively stable and at relatively low levels during the quarter. 
    
  The economic effects of financial derivatives are included in Farmer Mac's MVE, NII, and duration gap analyses.  Farmer Mac enters into the following financial derivative transactions principally to protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements on the value of assets, future cash flows, credit exposure, and debt issuance, not for trading or speculative purposes: 

"pay-fixed" interest rate swaps, in which Farmer Mac pays fixed rates of interest to, and receives floating rates of interest from, counterparties; 
                
    "receive-fixed" interest rate swaps, in which Farmer Mac receives fixed rates of interest from, and pays floating rates of interest to, counterparties; and 
                
    "basis swaps," in which Farmer Mac pays variable rates of interest based on one index to, and receives variable rates of interest based on another index from, counterparties. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had   $8.2 billion   combined notional amount of interest rate swaps, with terms ranging from less than one year to twenty-five years, of which   $2.3 billion   were pay-fixed interest rate swaps,   $5.5 billion   were receive-fixed interest rate swaps, and   $0.5 billion   were basis swaps. 
    
  Farmer Mac enters into interest rate swap contracts to synthetically adjust the characteristics of its debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its loans and other assets, thereby reducing interest rate risk and often times deriving an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than would  

98 

     Table of Contents  

otherwise be available to Farmer Mac in the conventional debt market.  Specifically, interest rate swaps synthetically convert the variable cash flows related to the forecasted issuance of short-term debt into effectively fixed rate medium-term notes that match the anticipated duration and interest rate characteristics of the corresponding assets.  Farmer Mac evaluates the overall cost of using the swap market as a funding alternative and uses interest rate swaps to manage specific interest rate risks for specific transactions.  Certain financial derivatives are designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate assets classified as available-for-sale to protect against fair value changes in the assets related to a benchmark interest rate (e.g., LIBOR).   
    
  Farmer Mac has used callable interest rate swaps (in conjunction with the issuance of short-term debt) as an alternative to callable medium-term notes with equivalently structured maturities and call options.  The call options on the swaps are designed to match the prepayment options on those assets without prepayment protection.  The blended durations of the swaps are also designed to match the duration of the related assets over their estimated lives.  If the assets prepay, the swaps can be called and the short-term debt repaid; if the assets do not prepay, the swaps remain outstanding and the short-term debt is rolled over, effectively providing fixed rate callable funding over the lives of the related assets.  Thus, the economics of the assets are closely matched to the economics of the interest rate swap and funding combination. 
    
  In addition to being exposed to the risk of asset and liability cash flow mismatches, Farmer Mac is exposed to the risk related to changes in its cost of funds relative to floating rate market indexes (such as LIBOR) on some of the floating rate assets it holds.  This exposure is referred to as "basis risk."  Some of Farmer Mac's floating rate assets reset on rate adjustment dates on the basis of a floating rate market index, whereas the related debt that Farmer Mac issued to fund those assets until their maturities may be refinanced on the basis of Farmer Mac s cost of funds at a particular time.  Basis risk arises from the potential variability between the rates at which those floating rate assets reset and the rates at which Farmer Mac can issue debt to fund those assets.  Farmer Mac can fund these floating rate assets in several ways, including: 

issuing short-term discount notes with maturities that match the reset period of the assets; 
                
    issuing floating rate medium-term notes with maturities that match the maturities of the assets; 
                
    issuing non-maturity matched, floating rate medium-term notes; or  
                
    issuing non-maturity matched, fixed-rate discount notes or medium-term notes swapped to match the interest rate reset dates of the assets as an alternative source of effectively floating rate funding. 
       
  Farmer Mac typically uses the last option identified in the list above to fund these floating rate assets because this funding strategy is usually the most effective way to provide an interest rate match, maintain a suitable liquidity profile, and lower Farmer Mac s cost of funds.  As funding for these floating rate assets matures, Farmer Mac seeks to refinance the debt associated with these assets in a similar fashion to achieve an appropriate interest rate match for the remaining life of the assets.  However, if the rates on Farmer Mac s discount notes or medium-term notes deteriorate relative to LIBOR during the time between when these floating rate assets were first funded and when Farmer Mac refinances the associated debt, Farmer Mac is exposed to a commensurate reduction in its net effective spread on the associated assets.  Conversely, if the rates on Farmer Mac s discount notes or medium-term notes improve relative to LIBOR during that time, Farmer Mac would benefit from a commensurate increase in its net effective spread on those assets.

     Table of Contents  

Farmer Mac is also subject to basis risk on some of its fixed rate assets as a result of its use of pay-fixed interest rate swaps, combined with a series of discount note or medium-term note issuances, as an alternative source of effectively fixed rate funding.  This risk arises because the rates at which Farmer Mac refinances its funding for some fixed rate assets through the issuance of discount notes or medium-term notes may vary from the agreed-upon rates based on the floating rate market index received by Farmer Mac on the associated swaps.  In these cases, if the rates on Farmer Mac's discount notes or medium-term notes were to deteriorate relative to LIBOR, Farmer Mac would be exposed to a commensurate reduction in its net interest income and net effective spread.  Conversely, if the rates on Farmer Mac's discount notes or medium-term notes were to improve relative to LIBOR, Farmer Mac would benefit from a commensurate increase in its net interest income and net effective spread.  
    
  To mitigate this basis risk, Farmer Mac seeks to issue debt of sufficient maturity to reduce the frequency of required refinancing of that debt over the life of the associated asset.  As of September 30, 2016, Farmer Mac held $6.3 billion of floating-rate assets in its lines of business and its liquidity investment portfolio that reset on the basis of floating rate market indexes, primarily one-month and three-month LIBOR.  As of the same date, Farmer Mac also had   $2.3 billion   of interest rate swaps outstanding where Farmer Mac pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a floating rate of interest. 
    
  During fourth quarter 2015, the levels at which Farmer Mac issued discount notes and medium-term notes deteriorated versus LIBOR.  Farmer Mac believes that this deterioration was caused by a significant compression of spreads between U.S. Treasury interest rates and corresponding interest rate swap rates, and was not related to any developments specific to Farmer Mac.  In response to this deterioration, Farmer Mac has slightly shortened the maturity profile of its effectively floating rate debt and increased its pricing targets on new floating rate and certain fixed rate asset purchases.  Although short-term funding levels improved somewhat during second quarter and third quarter 2016,  Farmer Mac's funding costs relative to LIBOR continue to be less attractive compared to its historical experience for certain LIBOR-based funding products. 
    
  As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, all financial derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as a freestanding asset or liability.  Changes in the fair values of financial derivatives are reported in "  (Losses)/gains on financial derivatives and hedging activities  " in the   consolidated statements of operations  .  For financial derivatives designated in fair value hedge accounting relationships, changes in the fair values of the hedged items related to the risk being hedged are also reported in "  (Losses)/gains on financial derivatives and hedging activities  " in the   consolidated statements of operations  .  The accrual of the contractual amounts due on the financial derivative is included as an adjustment to the yield of the hedged item and is reported in net interest income.  For financial derivatives designated in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, the effective portion of the derivative gain/loss is recorded in other comprehensive income; amounts are disclosed as a reclassification out of other comprehensive income and affecting net interest income when the hedged transaction occurs and affects earnings.  Any ineffective portion of designated hedge transactions is recognized immediately in "  (Losses)/gains on financial derivatives and hedging activities  ".  All of Farmer Mac's financial derivative transactions are conducted under standard collateralized agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential credit exposure to any counterparty.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac had   no   uncollateralized net exposures.  As of   December 31, 2015  , Farmer Mac had uncollateralized net exposures of   $47,000   to   one   counterparty.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Farmer Mac regularly accesses the capital markets for funding, and Farmer Mac has maintained access to the capital markets at favorable rates throughout 2015 and the first nine months of 2016.  Assuming continued access to the capital markets, Farmer Mac believes it has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to support its operations for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.  Farmer Mac also has a liquidity contingency plan to manage unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets.  That plan involves borrowing through repurchase agreement arrangements and the sale of liquid assets.  Farmer Mac is required to maintain a minimum of 90 days of liquidity under the Liquidity and Investment Regulations.  In accordance with the methodology for calculating available days of liquidity prescribed by those regulations, Farmer Mac maintained an average of   147   days of liquidity during third quarter   2016   and had   151   days of liquidity as of   September 30, 2016  .  
                                 
  Debt Issuance  .  Farmer Mac funds its purchases of eligible loan assets and investment assets and finances its operations primarily by issuing debt obligations of various maturities through a network of dealers in the public capital markets.  Farmer Mac works to enhance its funding operations by undertaking extensive debt investor relations initiatives, including conducting non-deal roadshows with institutional investors, making periodic dealer sales force presentations, and speaking at fixed income investor conferences throughout the United States.  Debt obligations issued by Farmer Mac include discount notes and fixed and floating rate medium-term notes, including callable notes.  
    
  Farmer Mac's board of directors has authorized the issuance of up to $18.0 billion of discount notes and medium-term notes (of which   $14.1 billion   was outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  ), subject to periodic review of the adequacy of that level relative to Farmer Mac's borrowing requirements.  Farmer Mac invests the proceeds of its debt issuances in purchases of loans, USDA Securities, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, and investment assets in accordance with policies established by its board of directors and subject to regulations established by FCA.  
    
  Liquidity  .  The funding and liquidity needs of Farmer Mac's lines of business are driven by the purchase and retention of eligible loans, USDA Securities, and Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities (including AgVantage securities); the maturities of Farmer Mac's discount notes and medium-term notes; and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities.  Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are the proceeds of its debt issuances, fees for its guarantees and commitments, net effective spread, loan repayments, and maturities of AgVantage securities. 
    
  Farmer Mac maintains cash, cash equivalents (including U.S. Treasury securities and other short-term money market instruments), and other investment securities that can be drawn upon for liquidity needs.  The following table presents these assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Table 23 

Farmer Mac's asset-backed investment securities include callable, highly rated auction-rate certificates ("ARCs"), the interest rates on which are reset through an auction process, most commonly at intervals of 28 days, or at formula-based floating rates as set forth in the related transaction documents in the event of a failed auction.  These formula-based floating rates, which may at times reset to zero, are intended to preserve the underlying principal balance of the securities and avoid overall cash shortfalls.  Accordingly, payments of accrued interest may be delayed and are ultimately subject to cash availability.  Beginning in mid-February 2008, there were widespread failures of the auction mechanism designed to provide regular liquidity to these types of securities.  Consequently, Farmer Mac has not sold any of its ARCs into the auctions since that time.  All ARCs held by Farmer Mac are collateralized entirely by pools of Federal Family Education Loan Program guaranteed student loans that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.  Farmer Mac continues to believe that the credit quality of these securities is high, based on the underlying collateralization and the securities' ratings.  To date, Farmer Mac has received all interest due on ARCs it holds and expects to continue to do so.  Farmer Mac does not believe that the auction failures will affect Farmer Mac's liquidity or its ability to fund its operations or make dividend payments.  All ARCs held by Farmer Mac are callable by the issuers at par at any time. 
    
  The carrying value of Farmer Mac's ARCs investments was   $17.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $44.9 million   as of December 31, 2015.  During the first quarter 2016, Farmer Mac sold two available-for-sale auction rate certificates and received gross proceeds of $26.8 million, resulting in a realized loss of $0.1 million, which Farmer Mac had recognized in third quarter 2015 as other-than-temporary impairment losses.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac's carrying value of all of its ARCs investments was   89 percent   of par.  The discounted carrying value reflects uncertainty regarding the ability to obtain par in the absence of any active market trading.  See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the carrying value of ARCs. 
    
  Capital  . Farmer Mac is subject to the following capital requirements   minimum, critical, and risk-based.  Farmer Mac is required to comply with the higher of the minimum capital requirement and the risk-based capital requirement.  The minimum capital requirement is expressed as a percentage of on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet obligations. The critical capital requirement is equal to one-half of the minimum capital amount.  Farmer Mac's statutory charter does not specify the required level of risk-based capital but directs FCA to establish a risk-based capital stress test for Farmer Mac, using specified stress test parameters.  Certain enforcement powers are given to FCA depending on Farmer Mac's compliance with these capital standards.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac was in compliance with its statutory capital requirements and was classified as within "level I" (the highest compliance level).  See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about Farmer Mac's capital position and see "Business Government Regulation of Farmer Mac Capital Standards" in Farmer Mac's Annual Report

on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016 for more information on the capital requirements applicable to Farmer Mac. 
    
  In accordance with FCA's rule on capital planning, Farmer Mac's board of directors has adopted a policy for maintaining a sufficient level of "Tier 1" capital (consisting of retained earnings, paid-in-capital, common stock, qualifying preferred stock, and accumulated other comprehensive income allocable to investments not included in one of the four operating lines of business).  That policy imposes restrictions on Tier 1-eligible dividends and any discretionary bonus payments in the event that Tier 1 capital falls below specified thresholds.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, Farmer Mac's Tier 1 capital ratio was   12.6%   and   10.5%  , respectively.  The increase in the Tier 1 capital ratio from year-end was due primarily to an adjustment to eliminate certain interest rate risk components of the risk weighting of assets to reflect the fact that Farmer Mac pursues a match funding approach to funding its assets and therefore does not bear material interest rate risk in its portfolio.  The impact of this change to eliminate certain interest rate risk components of risk weighted assets served to increase the Tier 1 capital ratio by 320 basis points.  This increase was offset in part by an increase in risk weighted assets primarily resulting from growth in outstanding business volume. For more information about Farmer Mac's capital adequacy policy and FCA's rule on capital planning, see "Business Government Regulation of Farmer Mac Capital Standards" in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , Farmer Mac was in compliance with its capital adequacy policy.  
    
  Farmer Mac II LLC redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock on March 30, 2015, the initial redemption date, at a cash redemption price equal to the liquidation preference (the same as the par value) of $1,000 per share, using the $150.0 million in proceeds of the preferred stock offerings Farmer Mac completed in 2014 and cash on hand to fund this redemption. The redemption of the Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock triggered the redemption of all of the outstanding FALConS on the same day. For more information on the Farmer Mac II LLC Preferred Stock and Farmer Mac's capital, see "Business Financing Equity Issuance Non-Controlling Interest in Farmer Mac II LLC" and "Business Government Regulation of Farmer Mac Capital Standards" in Farmer Mac's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016. 

Regulatory Matters 
    
  The Dodd-Frank Act contains a variety of provisions designed to regulate financial markets.  Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including those regarding derivatives, corporate governance, and executive compensation, apply to Farmer Mac.  On October 22, 2015, the Federal Reserve Board, FCA, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a joint final rule to establish minimum requirements for the exchange of initial and variation margin between swap dealers or major swap participants and their counterparties to non-cleared swaps.  This final rule, which became effective earlier this year, establishes minimum requirements for the exchange of initial and variation margin between Farmer Mac and its swap dealer counterparties in non-cleared swaps transactions.  On February 23, 2016, FCA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register to amend the Liquidity and Investment Regulations to comply with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act by removing references and requirements relating to credit ratings and replacing them with other standards of creditworthiness, as well as to revise the eligibility criteria and exposure limits for certain types of investments.  Farmer Mac submitted comments on this proposed rule to FCA on April 25, 2016.  Farmer Mac does not expect that any of the final rules that have been adopted

     Table of Contents  

under the Dodd-Frank Act (including the final rule establishing margin requirements for non-cleared swaps) or that are anticipated to be adopted (including the FCA's proposed rule that would replace references and requirements related to credit ratings with other standards of creditworthiness) will have a material effect on Farmer Mac's business activities and operations or financial condition.  Farmer Mac will continue to monitor all applicable developments in the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and expects to be able to adapt successfully to any new applicable legislative and regulatory requirements. 
    
  On July 27, 2016, the FCA published a final rule in the Federal Register to address Farmer Mac's board governance and standards of conduct, including conflicts of interest, risk governance, and Farmer Mac's existing disclosure and reporting requirements.  This final rule became effective on October 17, 2016.  Farmer Mac does not expect that this final rule will have a material effect on Farmer Mac's business activities and operations or financial condition.
