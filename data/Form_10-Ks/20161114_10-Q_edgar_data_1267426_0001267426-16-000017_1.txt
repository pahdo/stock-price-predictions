 Condensed Balance Sheets 
 (Unaudited) 

The accompanying notes are an integral part of this condensed statement. 

1 
   
 NOTE A - ORGANIZATION 
   
 BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the  Corporation ) was organized on October 15, 2003 under the laws of the State of Delaware to act as the assignor limited partner of, and to acquire and hold a limited partnership interest in Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the  Limited Partnership ). The Corporation will assign units of beneficial interest in its limited partnership interest to persons who purchase Beneficial Assignee Certificates ("BACs") on the basis of one unit of beneficial interest for each BAC.  The Corporation will not have any interest in profits, losses or distributions on its own behalf. 
   
 NOTE B - INVESTMENT IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
   
 On October 15, 2003, the Corporation was admitted as the assignor limited partner in the Limited Partnership. The Limited Partnership was formed to invest in real estate by acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating partnerships which will acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly-constructed, existing or rehabilitated low-income apartment complexes. The Corporation has recorded its $100 investment at cost. 
   
 NOTE C - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
   
 Events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were available to be issued must be evaluated for recognition or disclosure.  The effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date are recognized in the accompanying financial statements. Subsequent events, which provide evidence about conditions that existed after the balance sheet date, require disclosure in the accompanying notes.  Management evaluated the activity of the Corporation through the date the financial statements were issued, and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. 

Item 2.  
 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial  

Condition and Results of Operations  

Business 
    
 The Corporation was formed for the sole purpose of serving as an assignor for the Limited Partnership and will not engage in any other business. Units of beneficial interest in the Limited Partnership interest of the Corporation will be assigned by the Corporation by means of BACs to investors and investors will be entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Limited Partnership, including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Limited Partnership. The Corporation does not charge any fees for its services and has no income.  The Corporation is wholly-owned by John P. Manning. 
 
A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004, in connection with a public offering in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC. On August 10, 2004, an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series, became effective. As of September 30, 2016, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the general partner of the Limited Partnership for 11,777,706 BACs representing capital contributions of $117,777,060. 

2 
 The Limited Partnership's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the "Operating Partnerships"), each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants.  Each Operating Partnership in which the Limited Partnership invests will own apartment complexes which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance.  Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")(the "Federal Housing Tax Credit"), and provide tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources.  Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the "Rehabilitation Tax Credit").  Section 236 (f) (ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as Tax Credits.  The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income.  Some of the apartment complexes in which the Limited Partnership has invested are receiving rent supplements from HUD.  HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals.  At this time, the Limited Partnership is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of the apartment complex.   
 
As of September 30, 2016, the Limited Partnership had invested in 14 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47, 10 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48, and 24 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49. 

The primary business objectives of the Limited Partnership are to: 

(1)  
 
  provide current tax benefits to investors in the form of Federal Housing Tax Credits and, in limited instances, a small amount of Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which an investor may apply, subject to strict limitations, against the investor's federal income tax liability from active, portfolio and passive income;   

(2)  
 
  preserve and protect the Limited Partnership's capital and provide capital appreciation and cash distributions through increases in value of the Limited Partnership's investments and, to the extent applicable, equity buildup through periodic payments on the mortgage indebtedness with respect to the apartment complexes;  

(3)  
 
  provide tax benefits in the form of passive losses which an investor may apply to offset his passive income (if any); and  

(4)  
 
  provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Limited Partnership's investment in non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds.  The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value.  The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make sales desirable and if sales are permitted by government restrictions.  

The Corporation has no operational history or capital needs.

  Controls and Procedures  

(a)  
 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of C M Management Inc., carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Corporation's  disclosure controls and procedures  as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Corporation's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by it in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation's management, including the Corporation's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)  
 
  Changes in Internal Controls 

There were no changes in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.
