1.     ORGANIZATION, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES 

Organization  

Vermillion, Inc. ( Vermillion  Vermillion and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the  Company ) is incorporated in the state of Delaware, and is engaged in the business of developing and commercializing diagnostic tests for   gynecologic   disease. The Company sells OVA1  risk of malignancy test for   ovarian cancer   ( OVA1 ). Until August 2015, the Company distributed OVA1 through Quest Diagnostics Incorporated ( Quest Diagnostics ) (see Note   2  ). Since August 2015, the Company has distributed   the   OVA1 test through Vermillion s wholly-owned Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ) certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS, Inc. ( ASPiRA LABS )  .    The Company also offer  s   in-vitro diagnostic ( IVD ) trial services to third-party customers through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA IVD, Inc. ( ASPiRA IVD ), which was formed in April 2016.   ASPiRA IVD   is   a specialized  , CLIA certified,   laboratory provider dedicated to meeting the unique testing needs of IVD manufacturers seeking to commercialize high-complexity assays. ASPiRA IVD   was built   around a core of laboratory expertise and a United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-compliant quality system,   and strives to   deliver accurate and reliable results to its third-party customers suitable for FDA submission.  

Going Concern 

The Company has incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception, and as a result has an accumulated deficit of approximately   $  382,710  ,000   at   September   30  , 2016. The Company expects to incur a net loss   and negative cash flows from operations   in   the remainder of   2016 and the foreseeable future. The Company s management believes that successful achievement of the   Company s   business objectives will require additional financing.   Given these conditions, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The   condensed   consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.  

The Company expects to raise capital through a variety of sources, which may include the public equity market, private equity financing, collaborative arrangements, licensing arrangements, and/or public or private debt. However, additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital, it may not be able to continue sales and marketing, research and development, or other operations on the scope or scale of current activity and that could have a material adverse effect on   its   business, results of operations and financial condition.  

As discussed in Note 3, on March 22, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) pursuant to which it may borrow up to   $4,000,000   from the State of Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development (the  DECD ).   An initial disbursement of   $2,000,000   was made to the Company on April 15, 2016 under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement provides that the remaining   $2,000,000   will be   disbursed   if and when the Company achieves certain future milestones.    

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited   condensed   consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and   Article     8-03   of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the  

7   

opinion of management of the Company, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of results for the periods presented, have been included. The results of operations of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year or any other interim period.  

The unaudited   condensed   consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared with the presumption that users of the interim unaudited   condensed   consolidated financial statements have read or have access to the audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding fiscal year. The   condensed   consolidated balance sheet at December 31,   2015   included in this report has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP. Accordingly, these unaudited   condensed   consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31,   2015  , included in Vermillion s Annual Report on Form 10-K which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March   30  ,    2016   (the  2015 Annual Report )  . 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated results.    

Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies  

The Company has adopted ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , for costs incurred in conjunction with the DECD loan (see Note 3). ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. For public companies, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. 

Revenue Recognition 

Product Revenue 

The Company has adopted ASC 954-605,     Health Care Entities Revenue Recognition  ,     as   revenue from laboratory services has become significant to the   C  ompany  .     The Company's   product   revenue is generated by performing diagnostic services using its OVA1 test  ,   and the service is completed upon the delivery of test results to the prescribing physician. The Company recognizes revenue related to billings for Medicare and commercial payers on an accrual basis, net of contractual and other adjustments, when amounts that will ultimately be realized can be estimated. Until a contract has been negotiated with a commercial payer or governmental program, the OVA1 test may or may not be covered by these entities' existing reimbursement policies. In addition, patients do not enter into direct agreements with the Company that commit them to pay any portion of the cost of the tests in the event that their insurance declines to reimburse the Company. In the absence of an agreement with the patient or other clearly enforceable legal right to demand payment from the patient, the related revenue is only recognized upon cash receipt. 

E  stimates of amounts that   the Company   will ultimately realize require significant judgment by management. Some patients have out-of-pocket costs for amounts not covered by their insurance carrier, and the Company may bill the patient directly for these amounts in the form of co-payments and co-insurance in accordance with the   patient s   health plan. Some payers may not cover the OVA1 test as ordered by the prescribing physician under their reimbursement policies. The Company pursues reimbursement from such patients on a case-by-case basis. In the absence of contracted reimbursement coverage or the ability to estimate the amount that will ultimately be realized for the Company's services, revenue is recognized when cash is received. 

8   

Service Revenue 

The Company s service revenue is generated by performing   IVD trial services   for   third-party customers.   In accordance with SAB Topic 13, service revenue is recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Revenue recognized when cash is received and on an accrual basis for the   three and nine     months ended   September   30  , 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 

The Company has made no   other   significant   changes in its critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in   the 2015   Annual Report  .    

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), Compensation - Stock Compensation. The new guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including immediate recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement, changing the threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the employees' maximum statutory tax rates, allowing an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur, and clarifying the classification on the statement of cash flows for the excess tax benefit and employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within that reporting period. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements. 

2  .   AGREEMENTS WITH QUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED 

In July 2005, the Company entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement (as amended, the  Strategic Alliance Agreement ) with Quest Diagnostics to develop and commercialize diagnostic   tests from the Company s product pipeline. In connection with the Strategic Alliance Agreement, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Quest Diagnostics, pursuant to which Quest Diagnostics provided the Company with a   $10,000,000   secured line   of credit to be used to pay for certain costs and expenses related to activities under the Strategic Alliance Agreement. The credit agreement provided for the forgiveness of portions of the amounts borrowed under the secured line of credit upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of certain diagnostic tests. Through December 31, 2014, the entire loan was either repaid or forgiven except for   $1,106,000   which was in dispute. The dispute regarding the balance of the loan was resolved   i  n March 2015 for a payment to Quest Diagnostics totaling   $1,069,000  . As a result of this settlement, the Company recognized one-time items during the year ended December 31, 2015, including product revenue of   $163,000  , license revenue of   $202,000  , gain on extinguishment of debt of   $37,000   and reversal of other liabilities totaling   $41,000  .   

9   

Unrelated to the debt dispute described above, in August 2013, the Company sent Quest Diagnostics a notice of termination of the Strategic Alliance Agreement. Notwithstanding the termination, the Company agreed that Quest Diagnostics could continue to make OVA1 available to healthcare providers on the same financial terms following the termination while negotiating in good faith towards an alternative business structure. Quest Diagnostics disputed the effectiveness of the termination. Prior to the termination, Quest Diagnostics had the non-exclusive right to commercialize OVA1 on a worldwide basis, with exclusive commercialization rights in the clinical reference laboratory marketplace in the United States, India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom through September 2014, with the right to extend the exclusivity period for one additional year. 

I  n March 2015, the Company reached a settlement agreement with Quest Diagnostics that terminated all disputes related to the Strategic Alliance Agreement and the Company s prior loan agreement with Quest Diagnostics. The Company also entered into a new commercial agreement with Quest Diagnostics. Pursuant to this agreement, all OVA1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Vermillion s wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA LABS, as of August 2015, with the exception of a nominal number of OVA1 tests distributed through Quest Diagnostics after that date. Quest Diagnostics is continuing to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens from its clients to ASPiRA LABS for testing through at least March 11, 2017 in exchange for a market value fee. Per the terms of the new commercial agreement, the Company will not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers CA 125-II or other tests that Quest Diagnostics offers.  

I  n June 2015, the Company entered into a Share Repurchase Agreement (the  Share Repurchase Agreement ) with Quest Diagnostics. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement, the Company purchased from Quest Diagnostics   860,595   shares of Vermillion common stock for a total purchase price of   $1,290,892  , or   $1.50   per share. The price per share was agreed to in principle in March 2015 and based upon a simple average of the closing prices per share of Vermillion common stock for a trailing 60-day period at that time. This price was then reduced by a negotiated discount. Subsequently, the common stock repurchased from Quest Diagnostics was retired. 

3.       COMMITMENT AND CONTINGENCIES 

Development Loan 

On March 22, 2016, the Company entered into the   Loan   Agreement, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to   $4,000,000   from the DECD. Proceeds from the loan   were   utilized primarily to fund the build-out, information technology infrastructure and other costs related to the Company s Trumbull, Connecticut facility and operations. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of   2.0%   per annum and requires equal monthly payments of principal and interest until maturity,   which occurs   on     April 15, 2026  . As security for the loan, the Company has granted the DECD a blanket security interest in the Company s personal and intellectual property. The DECD s security interest in the Company s intellectual property may be subordinated to a qualified institutional lender. Under the terms of the   Loan   Agreement, the Company may be eligible for forgiveness of up to   $2,000,000   of the principal amount of the loan if the Company achieves certain job creation and retention milestones by March 1, 2018. If the Company is unable to meet these job creation   and retention   milestones within the allotted timeframe or does not maintain the Company s Connecticut operations for a period of   10   years, the DECD may require early repayment of a portion or all of the loan   plus a penalty of   5%  .    

A  n initial disbursement of   $2,000,000     was   made to the Company   on April 15, 2016   under the Loan Agreement  . The   Loan   Agreement provides that the remaining   $2,000,000   will be   disbursed     if and when the Company achieves certain future milestones. The loan may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty        . 

Operating Leases 

The Company leases facilities to support its business of discovering, developing and commercializing diagnostic tests in the fields of gynecologic disease  . The Company s   principal facility  ,     including     the   CLIA laboratory   used by ASPiRA LABS  ,   is   located in Austin, Texas  ,   and   the   CLIA laboratory   used by ASPiRA IVD is located   in Trumbull, Connecticut  .

Overview  

Our vision is to drive the advancement of women s health by providing innovative methods to detect, monitor and manage the treatment of both benign and malignant   gynecologic   disease, with our primary focus being diseases of the female pelvic cavity. 

We have expanded our corporate strategy with the goal of transforming Vermillion from a technology license company to a diagnostic service and bio-analytic solutions provider. Our plan is to broaden our commercial focus from ovarian cancer to differential diagnosis of women with a range of   gynecologic  al   disorders. Our strategy is being deployed in three phases. The three phases are a rebuild phase, which was completed in the third quarter of 2015, a transformation phase, which is ongoing, and a market expansion and growth phase,   which we expect to begin   in 2017  .   

During the first phase, we expanded our leadership team by hiring several new senior leaders including a chief executive officer. In addition, we expanded our commercial strategy,   re-established   medical and advisory support, rebuilt our patient advocacy strategy and established a billing system and a payer strategy outside of our relationship  

16   

with Quest Diagnostics. During the second phase, we completed the process of obtaining licensure of ASPiRA LABS in all of the states that require licenses  ,     are in the process of establishing   our own payer coverage for OVA1 and   plan to   launch a second-generation OVA1 test, trademarked Overa. In the third phase  ,   we plan to commercialize Overa by utilizing the full national licensure of ASPiRA LABS, managed care coverage in select markets, our sales force and existing customer base. Unlike OVA1, Overa uses a global testing platform, which will allow Overa to be deployed   internationally.     I  n October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union  , and in October 2016, we initiated the targeted launch of Overa in the U.S. with two key accounts converting from OVA1 to Overa.   We also plan to develop an LDT product series, which we refer to internally as OvaX. We anticipate that OvaX will include not only biomarkers, but also clinical risk factors, other diagnostics and patient history data in order to boost predictive value.  

I  n February 2016, we adopted a plan to streamline our organization. We reduced headcount and other expenses targeting an approximately 20% reduction in   go-forward   operating expenses in 2016, as compared to operating expenses in 2015. 

We are dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel high-value diagnostic and bio-analytical solutions that help physicians diagnose, treat and improve outcomes for women. Our tests are intended to     detect, characterize and stage disease, and to   help guide decisions regarding patient treatment, which may include decisions to refer patients to specialists, to perform additional testing, or to assist in monitoring response to therapy. A distinctive feature of our approach is to combine multiple biomarkers, other modalities and diagnostics, clinical risk factors and patient data into a single, reportable index score that has higher diagnostic accuracy than its constituents. We concentrate on our development of novel diagnostic tests for gynecologic disease, with an initial focus on ovarian cancer. We also intend to address clinical questions related to early disease detection, treatment response, monitoring of disease progression, prognosis and others through collaborations with leading academic and research institutions. 

Our initial product, OVA1,     is a blood test designed to, in addition to a physician s clinical assessment of a woman with a pelvic mass, identify women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian   tumor   prior to planned surgery.     The FDA cleared OVA1 in September 2009    , and we commercially launched OVA1 in March 2010. We have completed a second-generation biomarker panel known as Overa, which is intended to maintain our product s high sensitivity while improving specificity. We submitted our 510(k) clearance application for Overa to the FDA in March 2015, with the goal of commencing the marketing and sale of the panel on   a targeted   basis in 2016. We received FDA clearance for Overa on March 18, 2016. Overa uses the Roche   cobas   6000 platform    .   

In June 2014, Vermillion launched ASPiRA LABS, a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ) certified national laboratory based in Austin, Texas, which specializes in applying biomarker-based technologies to address critical needs in the management of   gynecologic   cancers and disease. ASPiRA LABS provides expert diagnostic services using a state-of-the-art biomarker-based diagnostic algorithm to   aid in   clinical decision making and advance personalized treatment plans. The lab currently processes our OVA1 test, and we expect the lab to process the CA 125-II test (which is marketed and sold by a third     party) in the future in specific markets   although we are prohibited from offering CA 125-II tests to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers (see Note 2 to our   third   quarter 2016 unaudited financial statements above)  . We plan to expand the testing provided by ASPiRA LABS to other   gynecologic   conditions with high unmet need. We also plan to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LABS. ASPiRA LABS holds a CLIA Certificate of Registration and a state laboratory license in California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. This allows the lab to process OVA1 on a national basis. The   Centers   for Medicare   Medicaid Services issued a provider number to ASPiRA LABS in March 2015. 

In 2016, we creat  ed   a new service within the ASPiRA channel strategy,  an ASPiRA   IVD Services   Program . In April 201  6  ,   we formed ASPiRA IVD   to     offer IVD   t  rial services to thi  rd  -  party customers.   A  SPiRA   IVD   is   a specialized laboratory provider dedicated to meeting the unique testing needs of IVD manufacturers   seeking to   commercializ  e   high-complexity assays. A  SPiRA   IVD   was built   around a core of laboratory expertise and a  n   FDA-compliant quality system  ,    and strives to   deliver accurate and reliable results to its third-party customers suitable for FDA submission  .    ASPiRA IVD   received    a   CLIA laboratory   license   in June 2016   and commence  d   operations   in   the   second   quarter of 2016  . 

17   

In this program, we   also   plan to leverage   our   existing infrastructure   and   enhance our pipeline of future technologies by fostering relationships with IVD companies who are developing new diagnostics including companion diagnostics platforms. We believe this   plan   will allow us to continue to be innovative in evaluating potential diagnostics. Our goal with the addition of this line of business is to invest in our short  -  term and long  -  term enterprise value while leveraging   our   specimen bank, database, FDA experience, laboratory informatics and operating efficiency. 

Strategy: 

We are focused on the execution of   five   core strategic business drivers in ovarian cancer diagnostics   and specialized laboratory services   to build long-term value for our investors:  

Maximizing the existing OVA1 opportunity in the United States by taking the lead in payer coverage and commercialization of OVA1. This strategy included the launch of a     CLIA   certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS, in June 2014;     

Improving OVA1 performance by obtaining FDA clearance of Overa, a next generation biomarker panel while migrating OVA1 to a global testing platform, which we believe may allow for better domestic market penetration and international expansion (FDA clearance was received on March 18, 2016);     

Building an expanded patient base by launching a next generation multi-marker ovarian cancer test   (distinct from Overa)   to monitor patients at risk for ovarian cancer;     

Expanding our product offerings by adding additional gynecologic bio-analytic solutions involving biomarkers, other modalities (e.g., imaging), clinical risk factors and patient data to aid   in the   diagnosis and risk stratification of women presenting with a pelvic mass disease  ; and     

Expanding our customer offerings with the launch of our ASPiRA IVD laboratory services.     

We believe that these business drivers will contribute significantly to addressing unmet medical needs for women faced with   gynecologic   disease and other conditions and the continued development of our business. 

OVA1 addresses a clear clinical need, namely the pre  -  surgical identification of women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor. Numerous studies have documented the benefit of referral of these women to gynecologic oncologists for their initial surgery. Prior to the clearance of OVA1, no blood test had been cleared by the FDA for physicians to use in the pre  -  surgical management of ovarian adnexal masses. OVA1 is a qualitative serum test that utilizes five well-established biomarkers and proprietary software cleared as part of the OVA1 510(k) to determine the likelihood of malignancy in women over age 18, with a pelvic mass for whom surgery is planned. OVA1 should not be used without an independent clinical/radiological evaluation and is not intended to be a screening test or to determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery. Incorrect use of OVA1 carries the risk of unnecessary testing, surgery and delayed diagnosis.      OVA1 was developed through large pre-clinical studies in collaboration with numerous academic medical centers encompassing over 2,500 clinical samples. OVA1 was fully validated in a prospective multi-center clinical trial encompassing 27 sites reflective of the diverse nature of the clinical centers at which ovarian adnexal masses are evaluated. 

In May 2015 we announced that the Company was approved for a product development grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas ( CPRIT ) for $7,500,000, to help fund the Company's new multi-site pelvic mass registry of patients undergoing evaluation, diagnosis, treatment and follow up for pelvic masses that may lead to gynecological malignancy. Receipt of the grant award was subject to execution of a grant contract with CPRIT. However, the Company and CPRIT were unable to reach mutually agreeable terms on the grant contract and terminated negotiations on   August   8  , 2016  . The Company now intends to fund its pelvic mass registry by utilizing its own resources and pursuing partnerships with third parties. 

On April 20, 2016, we announced the publication of the first clinical utility data demonstrating that identification of high-risk patients using OVA1 prior to surgery resulted in referral of nearly all patients who had primary ovarian malignancies to   gynecologic   oncologists. The study, titled  The clinical utility of an elevated-risk multivariate index assay score   in   ovarian cancer   patients  ,    was   published i  n the   June 2016 issue of the   peer-reviewed journal   Current Medical Research   Opinion  . 

18   

The study surveyed physicians   who   frequent  ly used   OVA1, and identified 122 patients who underwent surgery for a pelvic mass after a high-risk OVA1 score was reported. Of these, 65 had a primary ovarian malignancy, while the remainder were benign or had a metastatic cancer of non-ovarian origin. Pre-surgical involvement of a   gynecologic   oncologist was documented, including referral, consultation or availability on stand-by; and the specialty of the surgeon who performed the adnexal surgery was also recorded. Of the 4 patients whose surgery was not performed by a   gynecologic   oncologist, 2 required re-operation for complete staging by a   gynecologic   oncologist. In comparison, none of the 61 ovarian cancers that were operated on by a   gynecologic   oncologist required restaging. According to the National Academy of Medicine s 2016 report   titled  ,         ,      re-operations are common after non-specialists operate on ovarian cancer, and may result in delayed treatment, higher costs and inferior outcomes compared with  first time right  surgery by a   gynecologic   oncologist. 

I  n    May 2016 we entered into our first international distribution agreement for Overa.   Pursuant to this agreement,   Bio-  Medical Science Co., Ltd. will market and distribute   Overa on an exclusive basis   in South Korea.     Subsequently, we executed   exclusive international distribution agreements   for Overa   with Pro-Genetics LTD in Israel and MacroHealth, Inc. in the Philippines. MacroHealth is Vermillion s first decentralized international agreement with Overa specimen testing to be performed in the Philippines. 

In   July 2016,   as part of our campaign to pursue managed care coverage agreements throughout 2016,     we   entered into     contracts   for pay  e  r coverage of OVA1   with   Priority Health Managed Benefits, a Michigan healthcare insurance company  ,     and   Independent Medical Systems, a preferred provider organization based in Dallas  , T  exas  .    In August 2016  ,    w  e    announced   a   contract   for pay  e  r coverage of OVA1   with   Sutter Valley Medical Foundation   (d/b/a Gould Medical Foundation)  , a   California     network provider  .   In September 2016, we announced a contract for payer coverage of OVA1 with CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. 

Novitas Solutions, the Medicare contractor that has jurisdiction over claims submitted by Quest Diagnostics for OVA1, covers and reimburses for OVA1.  This local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions should essentially provide national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. However, ASPiRA has experienced difficulty in obtaining payment from Novitas Solutions for most claims submitted due to Novitas Solutions  administrative requirements.   In October 2016, Novitas Solutions updated its administrative requirements for OVA1 reimbursement  .    We believe this change will greatly improve our ability to obtain reimbursement for OVA1 from Novitas Solutions. 

In October 2016, we launched our pelvic mass specimen and data repository and began the collection of   In  stitutional   Review Board     patient consents for collection and cataloguing of serum samples for future research purposes. 

In November 2016, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ("ACOG ) issued Practice Bulletin Number 174 which included OVA1 as a  Multivariant Index Assay . This bulletin outlines ACOG's  new  clinical management guidelines for adnexal mass management.   

These new clinical management guideline  s   replace the July 2007 version, Practice Bulletin 83.   Practice Bulletins summarize current information on techniques and clinical management issues for the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Practice Bulletins are evidence-based documents  ,   and recommendations are based on the evidence.   This is also the only clinical management tool used for Adnexal Masses. Guidelines do not exist for Adnexal Masses, only Practice Bulletins. Guidelines do exist, however, for Ovarian Cancer management.    

The Practice Bulletin recommends that obstetricians and gynecologists evaluating women with adnexal masses   who   do not meet Level A criteria of a low risk transvaginal ultrasound should proceed with Level B clinical guidelines.   Level B guidelines state that the physician should use risk assessment tools such as existing CA125 technology or OVA1 ( Multivariate Index Assay ) as listed in the bulletin  . Based on this, OVA1 has now achieved parity with CA125 as a Level B recommendation for the management of adnexal masses, but OVA1 is the only recommended Level B tool   that has FDA clearance for use   assessing ovarian cancer risk in adnexal masses.

The number of OVA1 tests performed decrea  sed   29  % to approximately   2  ,  257   OVA1 tests during the three months ended   September   30  , 201  6   compared to approximately   3,183     OVA1 tests for the same period in 201  5  .    All tests for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 were performed by ASPiRA LABS.   Th  e   volume   during the three months ended   September   30  , 201  5 included   1,518     OVA1 tests performed by Quest Diagnostics   and   1,665   tests performed by ASPiRA LABS  .    We   attribute   the decreased number of tests performed   to volume   lost after   the transition of testing fro  m Quest Diagnostics to ASPiRA LABS in August 2015.          

Service Revenue  .  Service revenu  e was $  42  ,000 for   the three months ended   September     30, 2016. There was no service revenue in 2015. Revenue for ASPiRA IVD is being recognized once   certain   revenue recognition criteria  

20   

has been met   (see Note 1   to our   third   quarter   2016 unaudited financial statements above)  .     We expect service revenue to   increase     modestly   in the   fourth     quarter of 2016  . 

Cost of Revenue   - Product  .    Cost of product revenue was $  461  ,000 for the three months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to $  757  ,000 for the same period in 2015   as one-time costs in 2015   related to the   transition of   OVA1   testing from   Quest   Diagnostics to ASPiRA LABS     were not repeated in 2016  . We expect the cost of product revenue to remain consistent   with   third   quarter 2016 levels   in the   fourth   quarter of 2016. 

Cost of Revenue   - Service  .        Cost of service revenue was $  356  ,000 f  or the three months ended   September     30, 2016.   There was no cost of service revenue in 2015  ,   as ASPiRA IVD   did   not   commence operations   until 2016  .    We expect the cost of service revenue to   remain consistent in the fourth   quarter of 2016.          

Research and Development Expenses  .  Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and carry out clinical studies, and include personnel-related expenses, regulatory costs, reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with our collaborators and strategic partners. Research and development expenses for the three months ended   September     30  ,    2016   de  creased   $  504  ,000, or   58  %  ,   compared to the same period in   2015  .    This   decrease   was primar  ily due to   the expiration of   our   collaboration agreement   with The Johns Hopkins   University   School of Medicine   and   lower   personnel   and personnel related   expenses   due to our February 2016 restructuring and other terminations  .   We expect research and development expense to   remain consistent   with   third   quarter 2016 levels   in the   fourth   quarter of 2016  . 

Sales and Marketing Expenses  .  Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personn  el-related expenses, education and promotional expenses, and infrastructure expenses. These expenses include the costs of educating physicians, laboratory personnel and other healthcare professionals regarding OVA1. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education, medical meeting participation, and dissemination of scientific and health economic publications. Sales and marketing expenses   for the three months ended   September   30, 2016   decreased   $  856  ,000, or   35  %,   compared to the same period in   2015  .    Th  is   decrease   was primarily   due to   a reduction in personnel   and personnel   expenses due to   our February 2016 restructuring   and decreases in   consulting services  . We expect sales and marketing expenses to   decrease from     third   quarter 2016 levels   in   the   fourth     quarter   of 2016  . 

General and Administrative Expenses  .  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, professional fees and other costs, including legal, finance and accounting expenses and other infrastructure expens  es.   General and administrative expenses for the three months ended   September   30  ,    2016     decreased   by $  85  ,000, or   6  %,   compared to the same period in   2015  .    The   decrease   was primarily due to   the reduction of personnel-related expenses  .     We expect general and administrative expenses to   remain consistent with third quarter 2016 levels in the fourth quarter of 2016  .

Results of Operations -   Nine     Months Ended   September     30, 2016 Compared to   Nine     Months Ended   September     30, 201  5 

The selected summary financial and operating data of the Company for the   nine     months ended   September     30  , 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

Product Revenue  .  Product revenue was $1,  640  ,000 for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to $1,  500  ,000 for the same period in 2015.   Product revenue for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 consisted of $  407  ,000 from tests performed   for ASPiRA LABS    contractual clients and $  1,233  ,000 of revenue recognized based on ASPiRA LABS  cash collections.   All product revenue in 2016 was recognized from OVA1 tests performed at ASPiRA LABS.   Product revenue for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015 consisted of $1,  282  ,000 from tests performed by Quest Diagnostics  , including the one-time recognition of $163,000 in deferred product revenue upon the signing of our agreement with Quest Diagnostics in March 2015,     $84,000 from tests performed for ASPiRA LABS      contractual clients   and $  134  ,000 of revenue recognized based on ASPiRA LABS  cash collections.       

The number of OVA1 tests performed decreased   38  % to approximately   6,867   OVA1 tests during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to approximately   11,069   OVA1 tests for the same period in 2015. All tests for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 were performed by ASPiRA LABS. The volume during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015 included   8,914   OVA1 tests performed by Quest Diagnostics   and   2,155   tests performed by ASPiRA LABS  .    We   attribute   the decreased number of tests performed   to volume los  t after     the transition of testing from Quest Diagnostics to ASPiRA LABS in August 2015.          

Service Revenue  .  Service revenue was   $1  97  ,000 f  or the   nine     months ended   September   30, 2016. There was no service revenue in 2015. Revenue for ASPiRA IVD is being recognized once   certain   revenue recognition criteria has been met    (  see Note 1   to our   third   quarter 2016 unaudited financial statements above  )  . 

22   

Cost of Revenue   - Product  .        Co  st of product revenue was $1,  516  ,000 for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to $1,  822  ,000 for the same period in 2015.   The decrease in cost of product revenue was due to   one-  time items in 2015 related to the transition of OVA1 testing from Quest Diagnostics to ASPiRA LABS not being repeated in 2016. 

Cost of Revenue   - Service.    Cost of service revenue was $  416  ,000 for   the   nine     months ended   September   30, 2016. There was no cost of service revenue in 2015   as ASPiRA IVD was not formed until 2016  .   

Resea  rch and Development Expenses  .  Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and carry out clinical studies, and include personnel-related expenses, regulatory costs, reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work, infrastructure expenses, contract services and other outside costs. Research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with our collaborators and strategic partners. Research and development expenses decreased   by   $  1,030  ,000, or    3  6  %,   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016   compared to the same period in 201  5  . This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with our collaboration with   The   Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine   as well as lower personnel and related costs due to lower headcount.    

Sales and Marketing Expenses  .  Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, education and promotional expenses, and infrastructure expenses. These expenses include the costs of educating physicians, laboratory personnel and other healthcare professionals regarding OVA1. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education, medical meeting participation, and dissemination of scientific and health economic publications. Sales and marketing expenses   decreased by $  1,724  ,000, or   24  %, for the   nine     months ended   September   30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.   Th  is   decrease   was primarily   due to   a reduction in personnel   and personnel   expenses due to   our February 2016 restructuring   and decreases in customer seminars   and managed markets study costs  .    

General and Administrative Expenses  .  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, profes  sional fees and other costs, including legal, finance and accounting expenses and other infrastructure expenses. General and administrative expenses   in  creased by $  534,  000, or   13  %  , for the     nine   months ended   September   30, 201  6   compared to the same period in 201  5  .    The   in  crease was primarily due   to $  469  ,000   of   charges incurred in connection with opening the   ASPiRA   IVD   laboratory   and     $  82,000   of     increased consulting costs   associated with   international business development  ,    partially   offset by a reduction in personnel expenses  . 

Other Income (Expense), Net  .    Net o  ther   income was   $1  6  ,000 for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 201  6    compared to $  9  9  ,000 in the same period   in 201  5  . Other income for the   nine     months ended   September   30, 2015 related to recognition of one-time items related to the March 2015 agreement with Quest Diagnostics. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We plan to continue to expend resources selling and marketing OVA1   and   Overa  , operating our IVD trial services business   and developing additional diagnostic tests   and service capabilities  .   

We have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. At   September   30  ,    2016  , we had an accumulated deficit of $  382,710  ,000   and stockholders  equity of $  6,290  ,000  . As of   September   30  ,    2016  , we had $  8,080  ,000   of cash and cash equivalents and $  2  ,  641  ,000   of current liabilities.   Working capital was $  5,948  ,000 and $16,015,000 at   September   30  , 2016 and December 31, 2015  ,   respectively. 

On March 22, 2016,   we   entered into an agreement pursuant to which   we   may borrow up to $4,000,000 from the DECD.   We received an initial disbursement   of $2,000,000 on April 15, 2016   under this agreement  . The remaining $2,000,000 will be   disbursed   if and when   we   achieve certain future milestones. 

We   expect to incur a net loss   and negative cash flows from operations   in   the remainder of   2016 and the foreseeable future.   Our   management believes that successful achievement of   our   business objectives will require additional financing. Given these conditions, there is substantial doubt about   our   ability to continue as a going  

23   

concern. The   condensed   consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.    

We   expect to raise capital through a variety of sources, which may include the public equity market, private equity financing, collaborative arrangements, licensing arrangements, and/o  r public or private debt. However, additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to   us  . If   we are   unable to obtain additional capital,   we   may not be able to continue sales and marketing, research and development, or other operations on the scope or scale of current activity and that could have a material adverse effect on   our   business, results of operations and financial condition.    

Net cash used in operating activit  ies was $  11,199  ,000   for the   nine     months ended   September   30  , 201  6   resulting primarily from the net loss reported of $  12,122  ,000     a  nd   changes in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities of $  769  ,000   partially offset by   stock compensation expense of $  861  ,000  ,   depreciation and amortization of $  523  ,000   and prepaid expenses of $354,000  . 

Net cash used in operating activities was $  13,780  ,000 for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015 resulting primarily from the net   loss reported of $  14,132  ,000 and non-cash license revenue of $316,000, partially offset by stock compensation expense of $  908  ,000. 

Net cash used in investing activities was $  1,  2  40  ,000 and $  22  2  ,000 for the   nine   months ended    September   30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   Th  e     costs in 2016     resulted from purchases of property and equipment   for the ASPiRA IVD lab  oratory   and also included a $125,000 down payment on the   Roche c  obas 6000   analyzer   use  d   at ASPiRA LABS  . 

Net cash   provided by   financing activities was $  1  ,  8  77  ,000 for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 201  6  , which     consisted primarily of proceeds from the DECD loan. 

Net cash   provided by   financing activities was   $  15,  011  ,000     for the nine months ended September 30,   201  5  . The cash provided by financing activities   consisted primarily of proceeds from the   sale of common stock of $17,496,000 in July 2015, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock from Quest Diagnostics, in the amount of $1,291,000,   the repayment of short-term debt of $1,069,000   to Quest Diagnostics   and   $122,000 o  f offering expens  es relating to our December 2014 private placement.             

Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including, among others:    

resources devoted to sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;     

the rate of product adoption by physicians and patients;     

the insurance payer community s acceptance of and reimbursement for OVA1   and Overa  ;     

the successful launch of   O  vera  ;     

resources devoted to our IVD   trials   laboratory and services;     

the successful launch of our IVD trial services business;     

our plans to acquire or invest in other products, technologies and businesses; and     

the market price of our common stock.     

We have significant net operating loss ( NOL )     carryforwards   as of   September     30  , 201  6   for which a full valuation allowance has been provided due to our history of operating losses. Our ability to use our net NOL credit carryforwards may be restricted due to ownership change limitations occurring in the past or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may also limit the amount of NOL credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively.  

In connection with   a   private placement   offering of common stock and warrants we completed in May 2013, we   entered into a stockholders agreement   which, among other things, gives two of the primary investors in that  

24   

offering the right   to participate in any future equity offerings   by the Company   on the same price and terms as other investors. In addition, the stockholders agreement prohibits   us   from taking   certain   material actions without the consent of at least one of the two primary investors   in that offering  . These material actions include:  

Making any acquisition with value greater than $2 million;     

Offering, selling or issuing any securities senior to Vermillion s common stock or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for securities ranking senior to Vermillion s common stock;     

Taking any action that would result in a change in control of   the Company   or an insolvency event;   and     

Paying or declaring dividends on any securities of the Company or distributing any assets of the Company other than in the ordinary course of business or repurchasing any outstanding securities of the Company  .     

The   foregoing   rights terminate for each stockholder when that stockholder ceases to beneficially own less than 50% of the shares and warrants (taking into account shares issued upon exercise of the warrants), in the aggregate, tha  t   were purchased at the closing of the   2013   private placement. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of   September   30  ,    2016  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our   condensed   consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Per Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, information is not required. 

ITEM 4.  

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  

Our senior management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or   persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September     30  ,    2016  . Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer have concluded that as of   September     30  ,    2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting.  

25   

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.  

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

In the ordinary course of business, we may periodically become subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with ongoing business activities. The results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable resolutions are possible and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash   flows and financial position. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation could have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. While the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, there are no matters, as of   September     30  ,    2016  , that, in the opinion of management, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

There have b  een no material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed under  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of our 2015 Annual Report   and   2016 First Quarterly Report  .   The risks and uncertainties described in our 2015 Annual Report   and 2016 First Quarterly Report   are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
