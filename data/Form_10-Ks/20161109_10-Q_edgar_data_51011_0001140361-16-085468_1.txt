NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Interim Financial Statements

The accompanying financial statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of the management of Interdyne Company ( the Company ), contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring accruals, necessary to present fairly the financial position at September 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and changes in cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, although management of the Company believes that the disclosures contained in these financial statements are adequate to make the information presented therein not misleading.  For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report in Form 10-K as of June 30, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.

Note 2.  Changes in Significant Accounting Policies

There are no newly issued accounting pronouncements that the Company expects to have a material effect on the financial statements and there have been no changes in the significant accounting policies.

Note 3. Related party transactions

In prior years, the Company made advances to Acculogic, Inc., an affiliated company through common ownership and management.  The advances bear interest at 8.5% per annum, payable on demand.  The balance, including interest, was guaranteed by AMT Datasouth Corp., an affiliated company controlled by the CEO of the Company.  The balances due from Acculogic, Inc. as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were $0 and $194,104, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the total amount due from Acculogic, Inc. was repaid in full and consequently the guarantee ceased to be valid.

An officer of the Company charged a management fee totaling $1,500 for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for the use of a home office, accounting and other services. The balances due to this officer were $3,000 and $21,500 as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.

Item 2. 
 
    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Company is at present dormant and is looking for new opportunity.

The cash needs of the Company will be funded by collections from amount due from its affiliate.

Item 3 
 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Item 4. 
 
    Controls and Procedures

Our management, comprising the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer/Principal Accounting Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company.  It has designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information is made known to it, particularly during the period in which this report was prepared.

Index 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or Exchange Act)).   Based on this evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective considering the fact that the Company, being dormant, has only one person on staff, the Chief Financial Officer/Principal Accounting Officer, to (1) handle all accounting transactions (consisting of primarily collecting funds from a related party and paying all expenses, including fees to this same officer); (2) reconcile the bank account, and (3) prepare all financial statement disclosures. The above duties have no supervision or review to insure proper segregation of duties and review of disclosures.  As a result, material weaknesses over disclosure controls and procedures exist. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on the criteria set forth in   Internal Control - Integrated Framework   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission.   Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2016 considering the fact that the Company, being dormant, has only one person on staff to handle all duties of the Company.  There is no supervision or review to insure proper internal control over financial reporting. As a result, material weakness over internal control over financial reporting exists. 

Our independent auditors have not audited and are not required to audit this assessment of our internal control over financial reporting for the period covered by this report.

During our most recent fiscal three months, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
