NOTE
1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

a.      General     

InspireMD,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ), together with its subsidiaries, is a medical device company focusing
on the development and commercialization of its proprietary MicroNet  stent platform technology for the treatment of complex
coronary and vascular disease. MicroNet, a micron mesh sleeve, is wrapped over a stent to provide embolic protection in stenting
procedures. In October 2014, the Company launched a limited market release of its carotid embolic prevention system (CGuard 
EPS), which combines MicroNet and a self-expandable nitinol stent in a single device to treat carotid artery disease. In January
2015, the Company received CE mark approval for the rapid exchange delivery system and launched CGuard in countries in Europe.  

The
Company s coronary products combining MicroNet and a bare-metal stent (MGuard Prime  EPS) are marketed for use in
patients with acute coronary syndromes, notably acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions
(bypass surgery). The Company markets its products through distributors in international markets, mainly in Europe and Latin America.  

b.      Liquidity     

The
Company has an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2016, as well as net losses and negative operating cash flows in recent
years. The Company expects to continue incurring losses and negative cash flows from operations until its products (primarily
CGuard  EPS) reach commercial profitability. As a result of these expected losses and negative cash flows from operations
along with the Company s current cash position, the Company does not have sufficient resources to fund operations beyond
the third quarter of 2017. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

Management s
plans include the continued commercialization of the Company s products and raising capital through the sale of additional
equity securities, debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. There are no assurances however, that the Company will
be successful in obtaining the level of financing needed for its operations. If the Company is unsuccessful in commercializing
its products and raising capital, it may need to reduce activities, curtail or cease operations.  

c.      Fundraising     

On
July 7, 2016, the Company closed a public offering of 442,424 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and accompanying
warrants to purchase up to 1,769,696 shares of common stock. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $14.6 million
from the offering, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company. See Note 5e.  

NOTE
2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial
statements. In the opinion of management, the financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to state fairly the financial position and results of operations of the Company. These consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2015, as found in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on March 28, 2016. The balance sheet for December 31, 2015 was derived from the Company s audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of results that could be expected for the entire fiscal year.

3   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

In
April, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  The new guidance requires debt issuance costs
to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent
with the presentation of a debt discount. The new guidance does not affect the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs.
The new guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2016 and was applied on a retrospective basis.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $52,000 and $85,000, respectively were deducted from the carrying value of the  Current
maturity of loan  in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, Revenue from contracts with customers. The objective of the new revenue standard is to provide
a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries,
across industries, and across capital markets. The revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine
the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue
to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for
those goods or services, based on a five step model that includes the identification of the contract with the customer and the
performance obligations in the contract, determination of the transaction price, allocation of the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract and recognizing revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The revenue standard
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption
of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

On
July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which requires that inventory
within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory measured using last-in,
first-out and the retail inventory method are not impacted by the new guidance. The new guidance will be effective for public
business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. Prospective
application is required. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company
believes that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09   Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting which simplifies certain
aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including accounting for income taxes, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows as well as allowing an entity-wide accounting policy election
to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures as they occur. This ASU is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
in any annual or interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued, and all amendments in the ASU that apply
must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial
statements. In addition, the impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption is dependent on the
Company s share price at option expiration dates and restricted stock vesting dates.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, 
which addresses the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents (or amounts generally described as such) within
the statement of cash flows under ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, with the intent to reduce diversity in practice. Among others,
this ASU addresses cash flow treatment such as debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs and proceeds from the settlement of
insurance claims. Entities are required to disclose how the statement of cash flows reconciles to the balance sheet if restricted
cash is shown separately from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Entities must also disclose information about the
nature of the restrictions. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. A retrospective basis adoption is required.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE
4   LOAN AMENDMENT:  

On
June 13, 2016, the Company amended (the  Amendment ) the Loan and Security Agreement, dated October 23, 2013, as amended
(the  Loan Agreement ), to provide that, among other things, the principal payment shall be suspended for a four month
period beginning May 1, 2016, provided that the Company receives unrestricted and unencumbered net cash proceeds in an amount
of at least $10 million from the sale of the Company s equity securities with investors acceptable to the lender on or prior
to June 30, 2016. The Amendment also modified the term loan maturity date under the Loan Agreement to (i) April 1, 2017, if the
Company does not complete such sale of its equity securities and the lender does not waive such condition to complete such sale
prior to June 30, 2016, or (ii) June 1, 2017, if the Company completes such sale of its equity securities, or if the lender waives
such condition to complete such sale of its equity securities, prior to June 30, 2016. In addition, the Company agreed to increase
the end of term charge from $500,000 to $520,000 on the earliest to occur of February 1, 2017, or when the loan is paid in full
or matures. In connection with the Amendment, the Company and its subsidiary granted a security interest in their intellectual
property to the lender (see Note 11b). In addition, in connection with the Amendment, the Company issued the lender warrants to
purchase up to the number of shares of common stock equal to $182,399 divided by (i) the lowest effective price per share, determined
on a common stock-equivalent basis, for which the Company s equity securities are sold and issued by the Company in an equity
financing in which the Company receives unrestricted aggregate gross cash proceeds of at least $7.5 million, subject to adjustment
from time to time in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement, or (ii) if such equity financing shall not have been
consummated on or before July 30, 2016, or if, prior to the consummation of such equity financing, there shall be a transaction
involving a change of control or a dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company, then the closing price of a share of
common stock on June 13, 2016, subject to adjustment thereafter from time to time in accordance with the terms of the warrant
agreement. The warrants are immediately exercisable and have a five year term. The principal payments of May 1, 2016 and June
1, 2016 were suspended and although the July 2016 Offering (see Note 5e) had not closed prior to June 30, 2016, the lender agreed
to waive the July 1, 2016 principal payment. Additionally, on July 6, 2016, the lender agreed to waive the August 1, 2016 principal
payment, as well.  

The
Company has concluded that the above changes to the terms of the Loan Agreement do not constitute a troubled debt restructuring
as no concession has been granted. As such, the Company applied the guidance in ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments.
The accounting treatment is determined by whether (1) the Investors remain the same and (2) the change in the debt terms is considered
substantial.  

Since
the lenders remained the same before and after the Amendment, the Company has made a quantitative test, in order to determine
whether the Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, is substantially different from the Loan Agreement prior to the Amendment
became effective. According to ASC 470-50-40-10, from the debtor s perspective, an exchange of debt instruments between
or a modification of a debt instrument by a debtor and a creditor is deemed to have been accomplished with debt instruments that
are substantially different if the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument is at least 10 percent
different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original instrument. If the terms of a debt
instrument are changed or modified and the cash flow effect on a present value basis is less than 10 percent, the debt instruments
are not considered to be substantially different.

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

(UNAUDITED)  

Based
on the accounting analysis performed, the Company concluded that the Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, was not substantially
different from the Loan Agreement prior to the Amendment becoming effective, and, as such, accounted for the Amendment as a modification.
Accordingly, no gain or loss was recorded and a new effective interest rate was established based on the carrying value of the
Loan Agreement prior to the Amendment became effective and the revised cash flows pursuant to the Loan Agreement, as amended by
the Amendment, including the fair value of the warrants issued to the lender.  

Following
the closing of the July 2016 Offering (see Note 5e), pursuant to the warrant agreement discussed above, the Company issued to
the lender warrants to purchase 38,691 shares of common stock. The warrants are exercisable immediately and have a term of exercise
of 5 years from the date of issuance and an exercise price of $4.71. Given the settlement mechanism described above, the warrants
were classified as a liability and subsequently, upon closing of the July 2016 Offering, were reclassified as equity.  

NOTE
5 - EQUITY:  

a.  
      On
    January 26, 2016 the Company entered into option cancellation and release agreements with certain directors, the Chief Executive
    Officer ( CEO ), who at the time was acting as the Company s Chief Operating Officer, the former Chief Executive
    Officer ( former CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ). See Note 10c.   

b.  
      On
    March 21, 2016, the Company sold 117,327 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 58,668 shares of common stock
    in concurrent underwritten public offering and private placement (the  March 2016 Offering ). The common stock
    was sold at a price of $14.75 per share and each purchaser received a warrant to purchase one half of one share of common
    stock for each share of common stock that it purchased in the March 2016 Offering. The warrants, which are classified as equity,
    are exercisable immediately and have a term of exercise of 5 years from the date of issuance and an exercise price of $14.75.
    The March 2016 Offering resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.7 million ($1.4 million after deducting
    underwriting discount, placement agent fees and other offering expenses).   

In
    connection with the March 2016 Offering, on March 21, 2016, the Company issued to the underwriter and placement agent five-year
    warrants to purchase up to 5,867 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $18.44 per share. The warrants, which are
    classified as equity, are exercisable at any time during the period commencing six months following the date of issuance and
    ending five years from the date of issuance.   

c.  
      On
    May 24, 2016, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase of the total number of shares of common stock available
    for issuance pursuant to awards under the InspireMD, Inc. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan by 400,000 shares, to a total of 438,800
    shares of common stock.   

On
    September 28, 2016, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase of the total number of shares of common stock available
    for issuance pursuant to awards under the InspireMD, Inc. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan by 252,000 shares, to a total of 690,800
    shares of common stock.   

d.  
      On
    May 25, 2016 the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Amended
    and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the Company s number of authorized shares of common stock from
    50,000,000 to 150,000,000.

e.  
      On
    July 7, 2016, the Company closed a public offering of 442,424 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and accompanying
    warrants to purchase up to 1,769,696 shares of common stock (the  July 2016 Offering ). Each share of Series B
    Convertible Preferred Stock and the accompanying warrants were sold at a price of $33.00. Each share of Series B Convertible
    Preferred Stock is convertible into 4 shares of common stock reflecting a conversion price equal to $8.25 per share. The holders
    of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate per share of 15% per
    annum of the stated value for five years, payable in cash or common stock, at the Company s discretion.   

The
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares after five years from issuance. Additionally, holders
of the shares may elect to convert at anytime. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has certain anti-dilution provisions.
In addition, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to provisions providing for make-whole payments, pursuant to
which, if the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is converted into shares of common stock at any time prior to the fifth anniversary
of the date of issuance, the holders will receive all of the dividends that, but for the early conversion, would have otherwise
accrued on the applicable shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock being converted for the period commencing on the conversion
date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance, less the amount of all prior dividends paid on such converted
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock before the date of conversion. The warrants are exercisable immediately and have a term of
exercise of five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $5.00 per share of common stock.  

The
Company received gross proceeds of approximately $14.6 million from the offering, before deducting placement agent fees and offering
expenses payable by the Company.  

For
accounting purposes, the Company analyzed the classification of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, including whether the
embedded conversion options should be bifurcated. As the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is not redeemable, and the host
contract was determined to be akin to equity, the entire instrument was classified as equity.  

The
Company has also concluded that the warrants accompanying the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are classified as equity, since
the warrants bear a fixed conversion ratio and all other criteria for equity classification have been met.  

For
the calculation of loss per share, the additional shares of common stock that will be issued upon conversion of the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock have been included in basic loss per share since Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert
into shares of common stock after five years, if not previously converted. Dividend payments have been excluded from the loss
per share calculation, since the effect of the dividend payments in shares of common stock is anti-dilutive.  

During
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, 130,404 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock was converted into 912,828
shares of common stock.  

f.  
      Following
    the closing of the July 2016 Offering, pursuant to a warrant agreement (see Note 4), the Company issued to a lender warrants
    to purchase 38,691 shares of common stock.   

g.  
      During
    the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted to its directors and employees stock options to purchase a total
    of 149,857 shares of the Company s common stock. The options have exercise prices ranging from $3.25 to $12.50 per share,
    which exercise price was the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of each respective grant. Of
    the options to purchase 149,857 shares of common stock described above, options to purchase 28,331 shares of common stock
    are fully vested as of their grant date, 70,500 options have vesting schedule of 12 months granted to its new CEO (see Note
    10e), 23,401 options are subject to certain market and performance conditions granted to its new Vice Chairman of the Board
    of Directors (see Note 10a) and 27,625 options have vesting schedule of 3 years.

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

(UNAUDITED)  

In
    calculating the fair value of the above 28,331 options the Company used the following assumptions: dividend yield of 0%; expected
    term of 5 years; expected volatility of 85.81%-86.69%; and risk-free interest rate of 1.01%-1.25%.   

The
    fair value of the above 28,331 options, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was approximately $0.2 million.   

In
    calculating the fair value of the above 27,625 options the Company used the following assumptions: dividend yield of 0%; expected
    term of 5.5-6.5 years; expected volatility of 87.29%-87.46%; and risk-free interest rate of 1.20%-1.35%.   

The
    fair value of the above 27,625 options, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was approximately $0.1 million.   

h.  
      During
    the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted to its employees 88,125 restricted shares of common stock with
    vesting schedule of 12 months to 3 years. The fair value of the restricted shares of common stock, using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model, was approximately $419,000. Of the 88,125 restricted shares of common stock above, 70,500 restricted
    shares of common stock were granted to the Company s CEO, see also Note 10e.   

i.  
      On
    September 28, 2016, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s
    Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a one-for-twenty five reverse stock split of its common stock,
    par value $0.0001 per share, effective as of October 7, 2016, which decreased the number of issued and outstanding shares
    of common stock from 35.7 million shares to 1.4 million shares. All related share and per share data have been retroactively
    applied to the financial statements and their related notes for all periods presented.   

NOTE
6- NET LOSS PER SHARE:  

Basic
and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period attributable to common stock by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, including 387,178 and 1,153,117 weighted average shares
common stock issuable to holders of Sereis B Convertible Preferred Stock for the nine and three month periods ended September
30, 2016 (since they are convertible based on passage of time   see Note 5e). The calculation of diluted net loss per share
excludes potential share issuances of common stock upon the exercise of share options, warrants, restricted stocks and placement
agent unit as the effect is anti-dilutive.  

The
total number of shares of common stock related to outstanding options, warrants, restricted stocks and placement agent unit excluded
from the calculations of diluted loss per share were 2,449,774 and 200,477 for the nine and three month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

NOTE
7 - FAIR VALUE MEASURMENT:  

The
carrying amounts of financial instruments included in working capital approximate their fair value either because these amounts
are presented at fair value or due to the relatively short-term maturities of such instruments. If measured at fair value in the
financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of
the loan under the Loan Agreement approximated its carrying amount since it bears interest at rates that approximate current market
rates. See Note 4.

a.  
      On
    January 16, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed a new director as a Vice Chairman of the Board, effective as of January
    22, 2016, with a term expiring at the Company s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. On April 30, 2016, in connection
    with his appointment, the new director was granted an option to purchase 31,202 shares of the Company s common stock
    at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant on April 30, 2016, subject to
    the terms and conditions of the 2013 Plan and the 2011 Plan. Options to purchase 7,801 shares of Common Stock vest and become
    exercisable immediately upon the time of grant, and, until all 31,202 options shall have vested, options to purchase 7,801
    shares of common stock will vest and become exercisable each time upon (i) the Company raising at least $15 million through
    an equity offering; (ii) the Company s market cap becoming equal to or greater than $25 million; (iii) the Company receiving
    research coverage by three new analysts at a leading investment bank; or (iv) the tripling of the Company s market cap
    from the date of appointment. Any of the foregoing conditions, if achieved following the director s appointment but
    prior to April 30, 2016, would have been deemed satisfied on the date of grant. However, in the event (i) of the director s
    death or permanent disability, (ii) a change in control (as defined in the Plan) or (iii) if the director is asked to resign
    for any reason other than cause (as defined in the Company s form of Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement under its Plan),
    the options shall vest immediately in full. The options have a term of 10 years from the date of grant and the exercise price
    may be paid in either cash or on a cashless basis.   

INSPIREMD,
INC.   

NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

(UNAUDITED)  

The
fair value of options with market cap related conditions reflect the probability of achieving the respective condition, and are
recognized through the date in which it is expected to be met. The fair value of such options was determined using the Monte-Carlo
option-pricing model with the following primary assumptions: the probability to achieve various gross proceeds in future offerings,
dividend yield of 0%; expected term of 10 years; expected volatility of 85.73%; and risk-free interest rate of 1.81%.  

The
remaining tranches would vest upon achievment of performance conditions. Accordingly, the fair value of such options would be
recognized based upon the number of options expected to vest and when the occurrence of the condition is considered probable.  

In
calculating the fair value of the above options with performance conditions the Company used the following assumptions: dividend
yield of 0%; expected term of 5 years; expected volatility of 85.81%; and risk-free interest rate of 1.25%.  

b.  
      During
    the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company granted to its directors stock options to purchase a total of
    30,530 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $3.25-$8.25, in addition to the 31,202 options that were granted
    to the new director (see also note 5e). Of the 30,530 options above, 20,530 options were in lieu of cash compensation that
    was owed to them and already accrued for their services as directors for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter
    of 2016 and also for their services as directors during the second quarter of 2016. See Note 5g.   

c.  
      On
    January 26, 2016 the Company entered into an option cancellation and release agreement with certain directors, the former
    CEO and the CFO ( the Optionholders ), pursuant to which the parties agreed to cancel options to purchase an aggregate
    of 16,910 shares of common stock of the Company previously granted to each of the Optionholders. For accounting purposes,
    the cancellation was treated as a settlement for no consideration and accordingly all remaining unrecognized compensation
    cost amounting to approximately $800,000 was recognized.   

d.  
      On
    January 21, 2016, the Company and the Company s former CEO entered into a fourth amendment to the former CEO s
    Employment Agreement by and between the Company and the former CEO, in order to, among other things, (i) modify the term of
    the former CEO s employment to end on the earlier of June 30, 2016 or the date upon which a new president and/or CEO
    (or executive performing a similar role) commences employment with the Company (or, if such individual is promoted internally,
    the date such individual is promoted to the position of president and/or chief executive officer); and (ii) provide that,
    during the remaining term of his employment, the former CEO will receive (A) 50% of his base salary in cash payments, for
    all days that the CEO works during the remaining term of his employment, at the monthly rate of $18,750, payable in accordance
    with the Company s regular payroll practices, and (B) a lump-sum payment equivalent to 50% of the former CEO s
    base salary through June 30, 2016, at the monthly rate of $18,750, payable within 20 business days from the earlier of (x)
    the Company raising an aggregate of $5 million from investors, or (y) June 30, 2016.   

On
    June 6, 2016, the former CEO resigned from all officer and director positions with the Company, and a new president and CEO
    commenced employment with the Company.   

e.  
      On
    June 6, 2016, the Company appointed a new CEO, who was then the Company s executive vice president and chief operating
    officer. In connection with his appointment, the Company and the CEO entered into a fourth amendment (the  Fourth Amendment )
    to the employment agreement by and between the Company and the CEO, in order to, among other things, (i) change the title
    of his position to president and chief executive officer; (ii) modify the term of the CEO s employment to (a) continue
    until May 31, 2017, with the CEO resigning as a member of the Board of Directors at the end of such term if requested by the
    Company and (b) provide that in the event that the term is not extended beyond May 31, 2017 by mutual agreement of the parties
    and the Company does not offer the CEO a position as CEO and/or chief operating officer on the same or more favorable terms
    with a base salary that is at least 10% greater than his current base salary, the CEO s termination will be deemed a
    termination without cause; and (iii) amend the terms and conditions of the CEO s compensation, as described below.

with investors where the Company raises an aggregate of $5 million (the  Financing ) and (ii) March 15, 2017, the
CEO will receive 50% of his base salary in cash payments, payable in accordance with the Company s regular payroll practices,
with the remaining 50% of his base salary paid in a lump-sum payment on the first to occur of (a) the first payroll period that
is on or after the 20th business day following the Financing or (b) March 15, 2017 (such earlier date, the  Reduction Amount
Payment Date ). The Fourth Amendment also amends the terms of the CEO s bonus compensation to provide that (i) the
CEO is eligible to receive annual bonus compensation in an amount equal to 100% of his base salary upon the achievement of reasonable
target objectives and performance goals as may be determined by the Board in consultation with the CEO and (ii) on the Reduction
Amount Payment Date, the CEO will receive a lump-sum retention bonus in an amount equal to $106,458, subject to the CEO s
continued employment through such date.  

The
Fourth Amendment further provides that on or within 20 business days of the closing of the Financing, the CEO will be granted,
subject to approval of the Board of Directors and the CEO s continued employment by the Company through the applicable grant
date, (i) a nonqualified stock option relating to the number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to 2% of the
Company s outstanding common stock on the date of the closing of the Financing (the  Financing Option ) and
(ii) an award of a number of restricted shares of the Company s common stock equal to 2% of the Company s outstanding
common stock on the date of the closing of the Financing (the  Financing Restricted Stock Award ), in each case, subject
to the terms and conditions of the Company s 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan and a nonqualified stock option agreement and
a restricted stock award agreement to be entered into by the Company and the CEO. From the July 2016 Offering, the Company received
more than an aggregate of $5 million, and, as such, on July 25, 2016, the CEO was granted the Financing Option to purchase 70,500
shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $4.75, which is equal to the fair market value of common stock
on the date of grant, vesting on the first anniversary of the date of the grant, and on August 1, 2016, the CEO was granted the
Financing Restricted Stock Award of 70,500 restricted shares of the Company s common stock, vesting on the first anniversary
of the date of the grant.  

In
calculating the fair value of the above options the Company used the following assumptions: dividend yield of 0%; expected term
of 5.5 years; expected volatility of 87.29%; and risk-free interest rate of 1.22%.  

The
fair value of the above options, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was approximately $0.2 million.  

The
fair value of the above restricted shares of common stock, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was approximately $0.3

Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will probably not be accurate
indications of when such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information we have
when those statements are made or our management s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and
are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed
in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited
to:  

our
    history of recurring losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, significant future commitments and the uncertainty
    regarding the adequacy of our liquidity to pursue our complete business objectives;   

market
    acceptance of our existing and new products;   

negative

our
    dependence on single suppliers for certain product components and our ability to comply with stringent manufacturing quality
    standards and to increase production as necessary;   

intense
    competition in our industry, with competitors having substantially greater financial, technological, research and development,
    regulatory and clinical, manufacturing, marketing and sales, distribution and personnel resources than we do;   

entry
    of new competitors and products and potential technological obsolescence of our products;

legislative
    or regulatory reform of the healthcare system in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions;   

the
    fact that we will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future and that such capital raising
    may be costly, dilutive or difficult to obtain;   

the
    fact that we conduct business in multiple foreign jurisdictions, exposing us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
    logistical and communications challenges, burdens and costs of compliance with foreign laws and political and economic instability
    in each jurisdiction;

contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. We do
not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date
on which any such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  

Overview   

We
are a medical device company focusing on the development and commercialization of our proprietary MicroNet  stent platform
technology for the treatment of complex vascular and coronary disease. A stent is an expandable  scaffold-like  device,
usually constructed of a metallic material, that is inserted into an artery to expand the inside passage and improve blood flow.
Different than conventional stents, each of our stent is wrapped with MicroNet (a micron mesh sleeve designed to
permanently prevent plaque debris through the stent struts) in order to protect from embolic events, which we refer
to as the embolic protection system.  

Our
CGuard  carotid embolic prevention system ( CGuard EPS ) combines our MicroNet mesh and a self-expandable nitinol
stent in a single device for use in carotid artery applications. Our CGuard EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union
in March 2013, and we launched its release on a limited basis in October 2014. In January 2015, a new version of CGuard, with
a rapid exchange delivery system, received CE mark approval in Europe and in September 2015, we announced the full market launch
of CGuard EPS in Europe through a distribution agreement with Penumbra, Inc.  

Our
MGuard  Prime  Embolic Protection System ( MGuard Prime EPS ) is marketed for use in patients with acute
coronary syndromes, notably acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and saphenous vein graft coronary interventions (bypass
surgery). MGuard Prime EPS combines the MicroNet with a bare-metal cobalt-chromium based stent and, together with our first generation
MGuard stent combining the MicroNet with a bare-metal stainless steel stent, unless otherwise indicated, we refer to both kinds
of bare-metal stents as MGuard coronary products. We market and sell MGuard Prime EPS for the treatment of coronary disease in
the European Union. MGuard Prime EPS received CE mark approval in the European Union in October 2010 for improving luminal diameter
and providing embolic protection. However, as a result of a shift in industry preferences away from bare-metal stents in favor
of drug-eluting (drug-coated) stents, in 2014 we decided to curtail further development of this product in order to focus on the
development of a drug-eluting stent product, MGuard DES . Due to limited resources, though, our efforts have been limited
to testing drug-eluting stents manufactured by potential partners for compatibility and incorporating our MicroNet in-house onto
a drug-eluting stent manufactured by a potential partner.  

We
are also developing a neurovascular flow diverter, which is an endovascular device that directs blood flow away from cerebral
aneurysms in order to ultimately seal the aneurysms. Our flow diverter would utilize an open cell, highly flexible metal scaffold
to which MicroNet would be attached. We have commenced initial pre-clinical testing of this product in both simulated bench models
and standard in vivo pre-clinical models.  

We
also intend to develop a pipeline of other products and additional applications by leveraging our MicroNet technology to new applications
to improve peripheral vascular and neurovascular procedures, such as the treatment of the superficial femoral artery disease,
vascular disease below the knee and neurovascular stenting to open diseased vessels in the brain.  

Presently,
none of our products may be sold or marketed in the United States.  

Recent
Events   

Effective
as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 7, 2016, we amended our certificate of incorporation in order to effectuate a 1-for-25
reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock. All share and related option and warrant information presented
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reduced number of shares outstanding which
resulted from this action.   

On
July 7, 2016, we closed a public offering of 442,424 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and accompanying warrants
to purchase up to 1,769,696 shares of common stock. Each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the accompanying warrants
were sold at a price of $33.00. Each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 4 shares of common stock
reflecting a conversion price equal to $8.25 per share. The holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to
receive cumulative dividends at the rate per share of 15% per annum of the stated value for five years, payable in cash or common
stock, at the Company s discretion. The warrants are exercisable immediately and have a term of exercise of five years from
the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $5.00 per share of common stock. The warrants sold in this public offering
commenced trading on the NYSE MKT under the ticker symbol  NSPR.WS  on August 1, 2016. The Company received gross
proceeds of approximately $14.6 million from the offering, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable
by the Company.

critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation
and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies are more fully described in both (i)
 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and (ii) Note
2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. There have not been any material changes to such critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015.  

The
currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the U.S. dollar ( $  or  dollar ).  

Contingencies   

We
and our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. We record
accruals for these types of contingencies to the extent that we conclude the occurrence of such contingencies is probable and
that the related liabilities are estimable. When accruing these costs, we recognize an accrual in the amount within a range of
loss that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, we
accrue for the minimum amount within the range. Legal costs are expensed as incurred.  

Results
of Operations   

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues .
For the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenue decreased by $163,000, or 25.8%, to $469,000, from $632,000 during the
same period in 2015. This decrease was predominantly driven by a 40.4% decrease in sales of MGuard Prime EPS from $322,000 in
the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $192,000 in the same period in 2016, predominantly driven by a decrease in sales
due to the trend of doctors increasingly using drug-eluting stents rather than bare metal stents in STEMI patients. There was
no material change in the sales of CGuard EPS in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.  

With
respect to regions, the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease of $101,000 in revenue from sales of MGuard
Prime EPS from our distributors in Europe.  

Gross
Profit (Loss) . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our gross profit (revenue less cost of revenues) decreased to
$31,000 from $89,000 in the same period in 2015, or 65.2%. This decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to a decrease
in revenue of $163,000 (see above for explanation) and an increase of $35,000 of expenses related to the underutilization of our
manufacturing resources. These decreases in gross profit were partially offset by a decrease of $164,000 in material and labor
costs (due to the decreased sales). Gross margin (gross profits as a percentage of revenue) decreased to 6.6% in the three months
ended September 30, 2016, from 14.1% in the same period in 2015.  

Research
and Development Expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, research and development expenses decreased by 63.0%,
or $492,000, to $289,000, from $781,000 during the same period in 2015. This decrease in research and development expenses resulted
primarily from a decrease of $361,000 in compensation expenses, a decrease of $95,000 in development costs associated with CGuard
EPS and a decrease of $36,000 in miscellaneous expenses. The decrease in compensation is the result of the implementation of our
cost reduction/focused spending plan beginning in the first quarter of 2015, as well as us not granting any share-based compensation
to our officers and employees conducting research and development in 2016 as opposed to our practice in 2015.  

Selling
and Marketing Expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, selling and marketing expenses decreased by 44.0%,
or $259,000, to $329,000, from $588,000 during the same period in 2015. This decrease in selling and marketing expenses resulted
primarily from a decrease of $151,000 in compensation expenses due to the timing of employee turnovers, a decrease of $81,000
in travel expenses associated with the decreased size of our sales force and a decrease of $27,000 in miscellaneous expenses.  

General
and Administrative Expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased
by 30.9%, or $530,000, to $1,183,000, from $1,713,000 during the same period in 2015. The decrease in general and administrative
expenses resulted primarily from a decrease of $329,000 in consulting fees, a decrease of $125,000 in compensation expenses and
a decrease of $76,000 in miscellaneous expenses.  

Restructuring
and Impairment Expenses.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015 we incurred $418,000 of restructuring and impairment
expense made up of $260,000 of expenses related to the impairment of an MGuard Prime EPS royalty buyout option due to anticipated
lower sales of MGuard Prime EPS in the future, $101,000 associated with our early termination of our lease for a portion of our
office in Boston, Massachusetts and $57,000 of cash payouts to terminated employees in connection with our restructuring. No such
expense was incurred during the same period in 2016.  

Financial
Expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2016, there was no material change in financial expenses compared to the
same period in 2015.  

Tax
Expenses (Income).  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 there was no material change in tax expenses (income) compared
to the same period in 2015.  

Net
Loss . Our net loss decreased by $1,634,000, or 44.9%, to $2,007,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3,641,000
during the same period in 2015. The decrease in net loss resulted primarily from a decrease of $1,699,000 in operating expenses
primarily due to our cost reduction/focused spending plan. This decrease in our net loss was partially offset by a decrease of
$58,000 in gross profit.  

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues .
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenue decreased by $222,000, or 12.4%, to $1,572,000, from $1,794,000 during the
same period in 2015. This decrease was predominantly driven by a 50.7% decrease in sales of MGuard Prime EPS from $1,257,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $620,000 in the same period in 2016, predominantly driven by a decrease in sales due
to the trend of doctors increasingly using drug-eluting stents rather than bare metal stents in STEMI patients. This decrease
in MGuard Prime EPS sales was partially offset by a 77.3% increase in sales of CGuard EPS from $537,000 in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to $952,000 in the same period in 2016.  

With
respect to regions, the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease of $441,000 in revenue from sales of MGuard
Prime EPS from our distributors in Europe and a decrease of $186,000 in revenue from sales of MGuard Prime EPS from our distributors
in Latin America, partially offset by an increase of $364,000 in revenue from sales of CGuard EPS from our distributors in Europe.  

Gross
Profit (Loss) . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a gross profit (revenue less cost of revenues) of $158,000,
as compared to a gross loss (revenue less cost of revenues) of $160,000, during the same period in 2015, representing an increase
of $318,000. This increase in gross profit was attributable to a decrease of write-offs of inventory (primarily MGuard Prime EPS)
of $450,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, a decrease of $194,000 in
material and labor costs (due to the decreased sales) and a decrease of $93,000 in miscellaneous expenses. These increases in
gross profit were partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $222,000 (see above for explanation) and an increase of $197,000
related to the underutilization of our manufacturing resources. Gross margin (gross profits as a percentage of revenue) increased
to 10.1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from (8.9)% in the same period in 2015.  

Research
and Development Expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, research and development expenses decreased by 62.9%,
or $1,812,000, to $1,068,000, from $2,880,000 during the same period in 2015. This decrease in research and development expenses
resulted primarily from a decrease of $903,000 in compensation expenses, a decrease of $462,000 in clinical trial and development
costs associated with CGuard EPS, a decrease of $191,000 in clinical trial expenses associated with our MASTER II trial, decrease
of $203,000 of other research and development expenses related to MGuard Prime EPS and a decrease of $53,000 in miscellaneous
expenses. The decreases in compensation and miscellaneous expenditures related to MGuard Prime EPS are the results of the implementation
of our cost reduction/focused spending plan beginning in the first quarter of 2015.  

Selling
and Marketing Expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, selling and marketing expenses decreased by 57.1%, or
$1,484,000, to $1,116,000, from $2,600,000 during the same period in 2015. This decrease in selling and marketing expenses resulted
primarily from a decrease of $916,000 in compensation expenses due to our transition away from direct sales in favor of using
third party distributors, a decrease of $261,000 in travel expenses associated with the decreased size of our sales force, a decrease
of $162,000 in expenditures related to our reduced participation in trade shows, primarily the EuroPCR Congress, incurred in the
same period in 2015, and a decrease of $145,000 in miscellaneous expenditures. The decrease in spending was a result of our cost
reduction/focused spending plan.  

General
and Administrative Expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased by
25.4%, or $1,338,000, to $3,932,000, from $5,270,000 during the same period in 2015. The decrease in general and administrative
expenses resulted primarily from a decrease of $839,000 in share-based compensation expenses primarily due to us not granting
share-based compensation to our officers until July 2016, as opposed to our practice in 2015 of granting share-based compensation
to our officers in January. In addition, our share-based compensation decreased due to us not granting any share-based compensation
to our non-officer employees in 2016 as opposed to our practice in 2015, as well as the forfeiture of our former chief executive
officer s share-based compensation in January 2016. In addition to the decrease in share-based compensation, the decrease
in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from a decrease of $437,000 in consulting fees, and a decrease of $283,000
in miscellaneous expenses such as investor relations, audit, rent and travel, as a result of our cost reduction/focused spending
plan. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $221,000 in compensation expenses pertaining to the hiring of our
new chief executive officer on June 6, 2016, pursuant to the employment agreement, as amended on June 26, 2016.  

Restructuring
and Impairment Expenses.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we incurred $964,000 of restructuring and impairment
expenses made up of $576,000 of expenses related to the impairment of an MGuard Prime EPS royalty buyout option due to anticipated
lower sales in the future, $228,000 of cash payouts and $59,000 of restricted shares given to terminated employees in connection
with our restructuring and $101,000 associated with our early termination of our lease for a portion of our office in Boston,
Massachusetts. No such expense was incurred during the same period in 2016.  

Financial
Expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, financial expenses decreased by 25.5% or $218,000, to $638,000, from
$856,000 during the same period in 2015. The decrease in financial expenses primarily resulted from a decrease in interest expenses
due to the reduction in principal of our outstanding indebtedness.  

Tax
Expenses (Income).  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 there was no material change in tax expenses (income) compared
to the same period in 2015.  

Net
Loss . Our net loss decreased by $6,134,000, or 48.2%, to $6,597,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $12,731,000
during the same period in 2015. The decrease in net loss resulted primarily from a decrease of $5,598,000 in operating expenses
primarily associated with our cost reduction/focused spending plan (see above for explanation), an increase of $318,000 in gross
profit and a decrease of $218,000 in financial expenses.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

We
had an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2016, as well as net losses and negative operating cash flows in recent years.
We expect to continue incurring losses and negative cash flows from operations until our products (primarily CGuard EPS) reach
commercial profitability. As a result of these expected losses and negative cash flows from operations, we do not have sufficient
resources to fund operations beyond the third quarter of 2017. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern.  

Our
plans include the continued commercialization of our products and raising capital through the sale of additional equity securities,
debt or capital inflows from strategic partnerships. There are no assurances, however, that we will be successful in obtaining
the level of financing needed for our operations. If we are unsuccessful in commercializing our products and raising capital,
we may need to reduce activities, curtail or cease operations.  

On
July 7, 2016, we closed a  best efforts  public offering of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and accompanying
warrants to purchase common stock. This offering resulted in gross proceeds to us of approximately $14.6 million before deducting
placement agent fees and offering expenses.  

On
June 13, 2016, we amended the Loan and Security Agreement, dated October 23, 2013, as amended (the  Loan Agreement ),
to provide that, among other things, the principal payment shall be suspended for a four month period beginning May 1, 2016, subject
to conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, as amended. The amendment also modified the term loan maturity date under the Loan
Agreement to (i) April 1, 2017, if we do not complete such sale of our equity securities and the lender does not waive such condition
to complete such sale prior to June 30, 2016, or (ii) June 1, 2017, if we complete such sale of our equity securities, or if the
lender waives such condition to complete such sale of its equity securities, prior to June 30, 2016. In addition, we agreed to
increase the end of term charge from $500,000 to $520,000 on the earliest to occur of February 1, 2017, or when the loan is paid
in full or matures. The principal payments due on May 1, 2016, and June 1, 2016, were suspended, and although the July 2016 Offering
had not closed prior to June 30, 2016, the lender agreed to waive the July 1, 2016, principal payment. Additionally, on July 6,
2016, the lender agreed to waive the August 1, 2016 principal payment, as well.  

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015   

General .
At September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10,468,000, as compared to $3,257,000 as of December 31, 2015. We
have historically met our cash needs through a combination of issuing new shares, borrowing activities and product sales. Our
cash requirements are generally for research and development, marketing and sales activities, finance and administrative cost,
capital expenditures and general working capital.  

Cash
used in our operating activities was $5,614,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $9,379,000 for the same period
in 2015. The principal reason for the usage of cash in our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
was a net loss of $6,597,000 as well as an increase in working capital of $493,000, offset primarily by $1,240,000 in non-cash
share-based compensation that was largely attributed to compensation for our directors and chief executive officer, $194,000 of
non-cash financial expenses and $143,000 of depreciation and amortization expenses. The principal reason for the usage of cash
in our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was a net loss of $12,731,000 as well as an increase
in working capital of $195,000, offset by $2,600,000 in non-cash share based compensation that was largely attributed to compensation
for our directors and chief executive officer, $576,000 of non-cash expenses related to the impairment of our royalty buyout option
(discussed above), $191,000 of non-cash financial expenses and $195,000 of depreciation and amortization expenses.  

Cash
provided by our investing activities was $81,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulting from the receipt of
cash previously funded to employee retirement funds, compared to $9,000 during the same period in 2015.  

Cash
provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $12,756,000, compared to $9,605,000 during the
same period in 2015. The principal source of the cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, was the funds received from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants in a public offering closed on July 7, 2016,
as well issuance of shares and warrants in a concurrent public offering and private placement closed on March 21, 2016, for approximately
$14,424,000 of net proceeds, offset by loan repayments of $1,651,000. The principal source of the cash provided by financing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was the issuance of shares and warrants in a public offering for approximately
$12,432,000 of net proceeds, offset by loan repayments of $2,739,000 and $88,000 of payments made by us in satisfaction of tax
withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted stock held by some of our employees.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by a multiple of 2.1. Current assets increased by $6,989,000
during the period and current liabilities decreased by $1,209,000 during the period. As a result, our working capital increased
by $8,198,000 to $5,996,000 at September 30, 2016.  

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships with
unconsolidated entities or other persons that have, or may have, a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

See
Note 3    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  in the accompanied financial statements.  

Factors
That May Affect Future Operations   

We
believe that our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors,
including the cyclical nature of the ordering patterns of our distributors, timing of regulatory approvals, the implementation
of various phases of our clinical trials and manufacturing efficiencies due to the learning curve of utilizing new materials and
equipment. Our operating results could also be impacted by a weakening of the Euro and strengthening of the New Israeli Shekel,
or NIS, both against the U.S. dollar. Lastly, other economic conditions we cannot foresee may affect customer demand, such as
individual country reimbursement policies pertaining to our products. For a discussion of these and other risks that relate to
our business, you should carefully review the risks and uncertainties described under the heading  Part II   Item
1A. Risk Factors  and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Management s
Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As
of September 30, 2016, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and participation of management including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of
any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide
reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  

Based
upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2016.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

From
time to time, we may be involved in litigation that arises through the normal course of business.  

On
April 26, 2016, Microbanc, LLC and Todd Spenla of Microbanc, LLC filed suit in the New York State Supreme Court (New York County)
against us asserting claims for breach of agreement, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment and fraud and seeking approximately $2.2
million and 9% of the amount of stock and warrants sold in 2011 and 2012 in alleged damages relating to certain alleged finders 
fees that they claim are owed. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, however, we can give no assurance that we will prevail
on any claims made against us in any such lawsuit. Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in
the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results.  

On
July 12, 2016, Medpace Inc., a former service provider, filed suit with the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton County, Ohio, against
us asserting that we breached a master services agreement with Medpace Inc. by failing to pay Medpace Inc. certain fees purportedly
owed to it in connection with Medpace Inc. s provision of certain clinical development program services to Inspire Ltd.
We have removed the suit to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Since removal, Medpace Inc. has amended
its complaint to name InspireMD Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, as the only defendant. Medpace Inc. is seeking $1,964,822 in
damages plus interest, costs, attorneys  fees and expenses against InspireMD Ltd. Due to the uncertainties of litigation,
however, we can give no assurance that InspireMD Ltd. will prevail on any claims made against InspireMD Ltd. in any such lawsuit.
Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our
financial condition, liquidity or operating results.  

As
of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any other material legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is
a party or to which any of our property is subject, nor are we aware of any such threatened or pending litigation or any such
proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other than other than the foregoing suits filed by Microbanc,
LLC and Todd Spenla and by Medpace Inc.  

We
are not aware of any material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial
stockholder of more than 5% of our common stock, or any associate of any of the foregoing, is a party adverse to or has a material
interest adverse to, us or any of our subsidiaries.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors   

During
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except for the following:  

Risks
Related to Our Business   

We
face risks associated with litigation and claims.    

We
may, in the future, be involved in one or more lawsuits, claims or other proceedings. These suits could concern issues including
contract disputes, employment actions, employee benefits, taxes, environmental, health and safety, personal injury and product
liability matters.  

There
are two lawsuits filed against us or InspireMD, Ltd., one filed by Microbanc, LLC and Todd Spenla of Microbanc, LLC in April 2016,
and another filed by Medpace Inc. in July 2016. See  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  for more information. Due to the uncertainties
of litigation, however, we can give no assurance that we or InspireMD, Ltd. will prevail on any claims made against us or InspireMD,
Ltd. in any such lawsuit. Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have
an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims
may result in significant monetary damages that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.  

Risks
Related to Our Organization and Our Common Stock and Preferred Stock   

A
continued low trading price could lead the NYSE MKT to take actions toward delisting our common stock, including immediately suspending
trading in our common stock.    

Pursuant
to Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (the  Company Guide ), the NYSE MKT could take action to delist
our common stock in the event that our common stock trades at levels viewed as abnormally low for a substantial period of time.
In addition, the NYSE MKT has advised us that its policy is to immediately suspend trading in shares of, and commence delisting
procedures with respect to, a listed company if the market price of its shares falls below $0.06 per share at any time during
the trading day. For much of the several months prior to the 1-for-25 reverse stock split of our common stock which became effective
as of October 7, 2016, our common stock had traded at prices less than $1.00. Since we effected the reverse stock split, the closing
price of our common stock on the NYSE MKT has been above $1.00, but there is no assurance that our stock will not trade at levels
viewed as abnormally low for a substantial period of time which can lead NYSE MKT to immediately suspend trading in our common
stock.  

The
certificate of designation for our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock contains anti-dilution provisions that may result in the
reduction of the conversion price for the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock in the future. This feature may result in an indeterminate
number of shares of common stock being issued upon conversion.    

The
certificate of designation for our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock contains anti-dilution provisions, which provisions require
the lowering of the conversion price to the purchase price of future offerings. If in the future we issue securities for less
than the conversion price of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, we will be required to further reduce the relevant conversion
price, which will result in a greater number of shares of common stock being issuable upon conversion, which in turn will have
a greater dilutive effect on our shareholders. In addition, as there is no floor price on the conversion price, we cannot determine
the total number of shares issuable upon conversion. As such, it is possible that we will not have sufficient available shares
to satisfy the conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock if we enter into a future transaction that lowers the conversion
price. If we do not have sufficient available shares for any Series B Convertible Preferred Stock conversions, we will be required
to increase our authorized shares, which may not be possible and will be time consuming and expensive. The potential for such
issuances may depress the price of our common stock regardless of our business performance. We may find it more difficult to raise
additional equity capital while our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding.  

The
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock provides for the payment of dividends in cash or in shares of our common stock, and we may
not be permitted to pay such dividends in cash, which will require us to have shares of common stock available to pay the dividends.    

Each
share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate per share of 15% per
annum of the state value per share, until the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock. The dividends are payable, at our discretion, in cash, out of any funds legally available for such purpose, or in pay-in-kind
shares of common stock calculated based on the conversion price, subject to adjustment as provided in the certificate of designation.
The conversion price is subject to reduction if in the future we issue securities for less than the conversion price of our Series
B Convertible Preferred Stock. As there is no floor price on the conversion price, we cannot determine the total number of shares
issuable upon conversion or in connection with the dividend. As such, it is possible that we will not have sufficient available
shares to pay the dividend in common stock, which would require the payment of the dividend in cash. We will not be permitted
to pay the dividend in cash unless we are legally permitted to do so under Delaware law, which requires cash to be available from
surplus or net profits neither of which we currently have available. Additionally, we are also subject to certain restrictions
pursuant to our loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., which prohibits us from paying cash dividends or distributions
on our capital stock. As such, we do not expect to have cash available to pay the dividends on our Series B Convertible Preferred
Stock or to be permitted to make such payments under our loan agreements, and will be relying on having available shares of common
stock to pay such dividends, which will result in dilution to our shareholders. If we do not have such available shares, we may
not be able to satisfy our dividend obligations.
