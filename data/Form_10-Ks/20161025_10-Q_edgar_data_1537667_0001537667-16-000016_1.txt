  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

Note 1. Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Select Income REIT and its subsidiaries, or SIR, we, us or our, are unaudited. Certain information and disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , or our Annual Report. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included. All intercompany transactions and balances with or among our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Our operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. Reclassifications have been made to the prior years  condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year s presentation. 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates in the condensed consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, purchase price allocations, useful lives of fixed assets and the assessments of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets. 

Note 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2015-02,   Consolidation  . Among other things, this update changed how an entity determines the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The implementation of this update did not have an impact in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability, and FASB ASU No. 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  , which addresses the presentation of debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements. The implementation of these updates resulted in the reclassification of certain of our capitalized debt issuance costs as an offset to the associated debt liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The classification of capitalized debt issuance costs related to our unsecured revolving credit facility remains unchanged in accordance with ASU No. 2015-15. As of December 31, 2015, debt issuance costs related to our unsecured term loan, senior unsecured notes and mortgage notes payable of   $2,124  ,   $9,607   and   $41  , respectively, were reclassified from assets to an offset to the associated debt liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  , which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The implementation of this update did not have an impact in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which changes how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted subject to certain conditions. Currently, changes in fair value of these investments are recorded through other comprehensive income. Under this ASU, these changes will be recorded through earnings. We are continuing to evaluate this guidance, but we expect the implementation of this guidance will affect how changes in the fair value of available for sale equity investments we hold are presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  , Leases  , which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). ASU No. 2016-02  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right of use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation  , which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016.  We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which requires that entities use a new forward looking  expected loss  model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will have in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3. Real Estate Properties 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   120   properties (  361   buildings, leasable land parcels and easements) with approximately   44,763,000   rentable square feet. 
    
  On February 29, 2016, we acquired a joint venture interest in an office building containing approximately   344,000   square feet located in Duluth, GA. We paid   $3,908   for this   11%   ownership interest. Following this acquisition, we own   100%   of this office building. See Note 8 for more information regarding this joint venture arrangement, our acquisition of the   11%   interest and certain resulting accounting. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we also acquired one property (one building) with   57,420   rentable square feet for a purchase price of   $10,200  , excluding acquisition related costs. This property was acquired and simultaneously leased back to the seller. We accounted for this acquisition as an acquisition of assets and allocated the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of the acquired assets as follows: 

(1)   
    Purchase price excludes acquisition related costs. 
       
            (2)   
    We capitalized acquisition related costs of   $90   related to this transaction. The allocation of purchase price is based on preliminary estimates and may change upon the completion of third party valuations and our analysis of land and building valuations.  
       
  On October 12, 2016, we acquired a single tenant, net leased office property located in Richmond, VA with approximately   50,000   rentable square feet for a purchase price of   $7,760  , excluding acquisition related costs. In October 2016,  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

we committed to a plan to sell   one   mainland office property (  two   buildings) with   100,500   rentable square feet and a net book value of $  9,206  . 
       
  Certain of our real estate assets contain hazardous substances, including asbestos. We believe the asbestos at our properties is contained in accordance with current environmental regulations and we have no current plans to remove it. If these properties were demolished today, certain environmental regulations specify the manner in which the asbestos must be removed and we could incur substantial costs complying with such regulations. Due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of costs we may incur, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value and we have not recognized a liability in our financial statements for these costs. Certain of our industrial lands in Hawaii may require environmental remediation, especially if the use of those lands is changed; however, we do not have any present plans to change the use of those lands or to undertake this environmental cleanup. In general, we do not have any insurance designated to limit any losses that we may incur as a result of known or unknown environmental conditions which are not caused by an insured event, such as, for example, fire or flood, although some of our tenants may maintain such insurance. However, as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, accrued environmental remediation costs totaling   $8,160   were included in accounts payable and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. These accrued environmental remediation costs relate to maintenance of our properties for current uses and, because of the indeterminable timing of the remediation, these amounts have not been discounted to present value. We do not believe that there are environmental conditions at any of our properties that will have a material adverse effect on us. However, no assurances can be given that such conditions are not present in our properties or that other costs we incur to remediate contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Charges for environmental remediation costs are included in other operating expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
    
  On June 29, 2016, we received an assessment from the State of Washington for real estate excise tax, interest and penalties of   $2,837   on certain properties we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Cole Corporate Income Trust, Inc., or CCIT, in January 2015. We believe we are exempt from this tax and are disputing the assessment. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not recorded a loss related to this matter. 

Note 4. Tenant Concentration and Segment Information 
    
  We operate in   one   business segment: ownership of properties that include buildings and leased industrial lands that are primarily net leased to single tenants, with no one tenant accounting for more than 10% of our total revenues. A  net leased property  or a property being  net leased  means that the building or land lease requires the tenant to pay rent and pay, or reimburse us, for all, or substantially all, property level operating expenses and capital expenditures, such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and repairs, other than, in certain circumstances, roof and structural element related expenditures; in some instances, tenants instead reimburse us for all expenses in excess of certain amounts included in the stated rent. We define a single tenant leased building or land parcel as a building or land parcel with at least   90%   of its rentable square feet leased to   one   tenant. Our buildings and lands are primarily leased to single tenants; however, we also own some multi-tenant buildings on the island of Oahu, HI, and   one   mainland multi-tenant office property. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, approximately   19.7%   and   19.8%  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, approximately   19.7%   and   21.4%  , respectively, of our total revenues were from   11   properties (  229   buildings, leasable land parcels and easements) with a combined approximately   17,778,000   rentable square feet that we own on Oahu, HI. 

Note 5. Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
    
  We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including the effect of changes in interest rates. We use derivative instruments to manage only a part of our interest rate risk. We have an interest rate swap agreement to manage our interest rate risk exposure on a   $41,000   mortgage note due 2020, with interest payable at a rate equal to a spread over LIBOR. We assumed this mortgage note and related interest rate swap agreement in connection with our acquisition of CCIT in January 2015. 
    
  We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The following table summarizes the terms of our outstanding interest rate swap agreement, which we have designated as a cash flow hedge: 

9 

     Table of Contents  

(1)   
    The interest rate consists of the underlying index swapped to a fixed rate and the applicable interest rate spread. 
       
  The table below presents the effects of our interest rate derivative in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015: 

We may enter into additional interest rate swaps or hedge agreements to manage some of our interest rate risk associated with our other floating rate borrowings. 

Note 6. Indebtedness 
    
  Our principal debt obligations at   September 30, 2016   were: (1) our   $297,000   of outstanding borrowings under our   $750,000   unsecured revolving credit facility; (2) our   $350,000   unsecured term loan; (3) an aggregate outstanding principal amount of   $1,450,000   of public issuances of senior unsecured notes; and (4) an aggregate outstanding principal amount of   $285,290   of mortgage notes. 
    
  Our   $750,000   revolving credit facility and our   $350,000   term loan are governed by a credit agreement with a syndicate of institutional lenders. This credit agreement includes a feature under which the maximum aggregate borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and the term loan may be increased to up to   $2,200,000   on a combined basis under certain circumstances. 
    
  Our   $750,000   revolving credit facility has a maturity date of March 29, 2019, interest payable on borrowings of LIBOR plus 105 basis points and a facility fee of 20 basis points per annum on the total amount of lending commitments. Both the interest rate premium and the facility fee for the revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment based on changes to our credit ratings. Upon the payment of an extension fee and meeting other conditions, we have the option to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to March 29, 2020. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was   1.50%   and   1.44%  , respectively. The weighted average annual interest rate for borrowings under our revolving credit facility was   1.49%   and   1.26%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   1.46%   and   1.26%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and   no   principal repayment is due until maturity. As of   September 30, 2016   and   October 24, 2016  , we had   $297,000   and   $282,000  , respectively, outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  Our   $350,000   term loan has a maturity date of March 31, 2020 and interest payable on the amount outstanding of LIBOR plus 115 basis points. The interest rate premium for our term loan is subject to adjustment based on changes to our credit ratings. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the annual interest rate payable for the amount outstanding under our term loan was   1.67%   and   1.39%  , respectively. The weighted average annual interest rate for the amount outstanding under our term loan was   1.64%   and   1.34%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   1.61%   and   1.34%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Our credit agreement and our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplement provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes The RMR Group LLC, or RMR LLC, ceasing to act as our business manager and property manager. Our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplement and our credit agreement also contain a number of covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts or to make distributions under certain circumstances, and generally require us to maintain certain financial ratios. We believe we were in compliance with the terms and conditions of the respective covenants under our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplement and our credit agreement at   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016  ,   nine   of our properties (  12   buildings) with a net book value of   $450,555   were encumbered by mortgages we assumed in connection with our acquisition of those properties. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under these mortgage notes as of   September 30, 2016   was   $285,290  . These mortgage notes are non-recourse, subject to certain limited exceptions, and do not contain any material financial covenants.

    Our   1,586,836   shares of class A common stock of The RMR Group Inc., or RMR Inc., which are included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets, are reported at fair value which is based on quoted market prices (Level 1 inputs). Our historical cost basis for these shares is   $42,686  . The unrealized gain of   $17,519   for these shares as of   September 30, 2016   is included in cumulative other comprehensive income (loss) in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
               (2)   
    As discussed in Note 5, we have an interest rate swap agreement on a   $41,000   mortgage note. This interest rate swap agreement is carried at fair value and is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and is valued using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of this instrument is determined using interest rate pricing models. Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the estimate presented in the table above is not necessarily indicative of the amount for which we could be liable upon extinguishment of the liability. 
       
  In addition to the asset and liability described in the table above, our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, rents receivable, a revolving credit facility, a term loan, senior unsecured notes, mortgage notes payable, accounts payable, rents collected in advance, security deposits and amounts due to related persons. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of our financial instruments approximated their carrying values in our condensed consolidated financial statements, due to their short term nature or variable interest rates, except as follows: 

(1)   
    Includes unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts. 
       
  We estimate the fair value of our senior unsecured notes using an average of the bid and ask prices of the notes as of the measurement date (Level 2 inputs). We estimate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable using discounted cash flow analyses and currently prevailing market rates as of the measurement date (Level 3 inputs). Because Level 3 inputs are unobservable, our estimated fair value may differ materially from the actual fair value.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report. 

OVERVIEW 
    
  We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, organized under Maryland law. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned 120 properties (361 buildings, leasable land parcels and easements), located in 35 states, that contain approximately 44.8 million rentable square feet and were approximately 96.8% leased (based on rentable square feet). For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , approximately 80.3% of our total revenue was from 109 properties (132 buildings) located throughout the U.S. mainland, or our Mainland Properties. The remainder of our total revenue for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , or 19.7%, was from 11 properties (229 buildings, leasable land parcels and easements) with approximately 17.8 million rentable square feet we own on the island of Oahu, HI, or our Hawaii Properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , our properties were leased to 310 different tenants, with a weighted average remaining lease term (based upon annualized rental revenue) of approximately 10.1 years. The term annualized rental revenue as used in this section is defined as the annualized contractual rents, as of   September 30, 2016  , from tenants pursuant to existing leases, including straight line rent adjustments and excluding lease value amortization, and further adjusted for tenant concessions, including free rent and amounts reimbursed to tenants, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements from tenants pursuant to existing leases. 
       
  On January 29, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Cole Corporate Income Trust, Inc., or CCIT, by means of a merger, or the CCIT Merger. As a result of the CCIT Merger and related transactions, we acquired CCIT s full property portfolio which included 64 office and industrial net leased properties (73 buildings), or the 64 CCIT Properties, as well as 23 healthcare properties which we sold concurrently to Senior Housing Properties Trust, or SNH. The properties we acquired and retained in the CCIT Merger significantly increased the size of our property portfolio and significantly increased the proportion of our total revenue that we earn from our Mainland Properties. 
    
  Property Operations 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , 96.8% of our rentable square feet was leased, compared to 97.7% of our rentable square feet as of   September 30, 2015  . Occupancy data for our properties as of   September 30, 2016   and 2015 is as follows (square feet in thousands): 

(2)   
    Subject to modest adjustments when space is re-measured or re-configured for new tenants and when land leases are converted to building leases. 
               (3)   
    Percent leased includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases as of   September 30, 2016  , if any, and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants, if any. 
       
  The average annualized effective rental rate per square foot, as defined below, for our properties for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 are as follows:  

16 

     Table of Contents  

(1)   
    Average annualized effective rental rate per square foot leased represents annualized total revenue during the period specified divided by the average rentable square feet leased during the period specified. 
        
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we entered lease renewals and new leases for approximately 997,000 square feet at weighted average rental rates (by square feet) that were approximately 4.9% higher than prior rates for the same space. The weighted average lease term by square footage for new and renewal leases entered into during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was 9.1 years. Commitments for tenant improvements, leasing costs and concessions for leases entered into during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $848,000, or $0.09 per square foot per year of the weighted average lease term. 
    
  Revenues from our Hawaii Properties, which represented approximately 19.7% of our total rental revenue for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , have generally increased under our ownership as rents under the leases for those properties have reset to or renewed at the then current fair market value. We expect to realize increases in the future from similar rent resets or renewals, although the impact of such future increases over the next few years is expected to be modest because fewer leases are subject to rent resets during that period. In addition, the percentage of our total revenues derived from our Hawaii Properties has decreased compared with past periods because of our acquisition of Mainland Properties, including in the CCIT Merger. 
    
  As shown in the table below, approximately 1.4% of our total rented square feet and approximately 1.2% of our total annualized rental revenue as of   September 30, 2016  , are included in leases scheduled to expire by December 31, 2017. As of   September 30, 2016  , our lease expirations by year are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands): 

(1)   
    Rented square feet is pursuant to existing leases as of   September 30, 2016  , and includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, if any, and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants, if any.

     Table of Contents  

A significant portion of our Hawaii Properties are lands leased for rents that are periodically reset based on then current fair market values, generally every five to ten years.  The following chart shows the annualized rental revenue as of   September 30, 2016   scheduled to reset at our Hawaii lands. 
    
  Scheduled Rent Resets At Hawaii Lands 
  (dollars in thousands) 

With respect to our Hawaii land leases, we intend to negotiate with our tenants as rents under their leases approach their scheduled reset date in order to achieve new rents based on the then current fair market values. If we are unable to reach an agreement with a tenant on a rent reset, our Hawaii land leases typically provide that rent is reset based on an appraisal process. Despite our prior experience with rent resets in Hawaii, our ability to increase rents when rent resets occur depends upon market conditions which are beyond our control. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that the increases in rents which we have achieved in the past will be repeated in the future, and it is possible that rents could reset to a lower level if fair market values decrease. 
    
  We expect to seek to renew or extend the terms of leases relating to our Mainland Properties when they expire. Because of the capital improvements many of the tenants in our Mainland Properties have invested in and because many of these properties may be of strategic importance to the tenants  businesses, we believe that there may be a greater likelihood that these tenants will renew or extend their leases when they expire as compared to tenants in a property with multiple tenants. However, we also believe that if a building previously occupied by a single tenant becomes vacant, it may take longer and cost more to locate a new tenant than when space becomes vacant in a multi-tenant property, in part because in place improvements designed specifically for the needs of the prior single tenant may need to be replaced. 
    
  Lease renewal rents, rent resets and rental rates for which available space may be leased in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these renewals, rent reset rates and new leases are negotiated. Whenever we extend, renew or enter into new leases for our properties, we intend to seek rents which are equal to or higher than our historical rents for the same properties; however, our ability to maintain or increase the rents for our current properties will depend in large part upon market conditions, which are beyond our control.

     Table of Contents  

We generally receive rents from our tenants monthly in advance. As of   September 30, 2016  , tenants representing 1% or more of our total annualized rental revenue were as follows (square feet in thousands): 

(1)   
    Square feet is pursuant to existing leases as of   September 30, 2016  , and includes (i) space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, if any, and (ii) space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants, if any. 
       
  Investment Activities     (dollars in thousands) 
    
  As a result of the CCIT Merger, we acquired an 89% interest in a joint venture that owned an office property in Duluth, GA. On February 29, 2016, we purchased the 11% ownership interest in that joint venture that we did not own for $3,908. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we acquired a single tenant net leased office property located in Huntsville, AL with approximately 57,000 rentable square feet for a purchase price of $10,200, excluding acquisition related costs. This property was acquired and simultaneously leased back to the seller for an initial lease term of 15 years. 
    
  On October 12, 2016, we acquired a single tenant, net leased office property located in Richmond, VA with approximately 50,000 rentable square feet for a purchase price of $7,760, excluding acquisition related costs. In October 2016, we also committed to a plan to sell one mainland office property with 100,500 rentable square feet and a net book value of approximately $9,206. There is no assurance that we will complete a sale of this property or that we will realize net proceeds in an amount at least equal to the carrying value of this property. 
    
  Our strategy related to property acquisitions is materially unchanged from that disclosed in our Annual Report. We currently intend to expand our investments by primarily acquiring single tenant, net leased properties throughout the mainland United States and we expect to use the extensive nationwide resources of our manager, The RMR Group LLC, or RMR LLC, to locate and acquire such properties. One of our goals in acquiring properties will be to further diversify our sources of rents and thus improve the stability of our revenues. Another goal will be to purchase properties that produce rents, less property operating expenses, that are greater than our capital costs for the properties and, accordingly, allow us to increase distributions  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

to our shareholders over time. We expect that most of our acquisition efforts will focus on office and industrial properties; however, we may consider acquiring other types of properties, including properties which are net leased to single tenants for retail uses and special purpose properties specifically suited to particular tenants  requirements. We also may acquire properties in Hawaii, but we currently expect this will not be a significant part of our future acquisitions because there are limited opportunities to acquire properties in Hawaii, especially to acquire lands which are leased to third party tenants.

    The calculation of net operating income, or NOI, excludes certain components of net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to our property level results of operations. We calculate NOI as shown above. We define NOI as income from our rental of real estate less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions because we record those amounts as depreciation and amortization. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it may help both investors and management to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI to evaluate individual and company wide property level performance, and we  
     
   21 

     Table of Contents  

believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributed to SIR or operating income as an indicator of our operating performance or as a measure of our liquidity. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributed to SIR and operating income as presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI differently than we do. 
    
            (4)   
    We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, attributed to SIR, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, attributed to SIR, as shown above. FFO attributed to SIR is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which is net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and the difference between net income and FFO allocated to noncontrolling interest, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to us. Our calculation of Normalized FFO attributed to SIR differs from NAREIT s definition of FFO because we include business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of our core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will ultimately be payable when all contingencies for determining any such fees are determined at the end of the calendar year and we exclude acquisition related costs, loss on early extinguishment of debt and Normalized FFO from noncontrolling interest, net of FFO, if any. We consider FFO attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income attributed to a REIT and operating income. We believe that FFO attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR are among the factors considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in our credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to us of debt and equity capital, our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance and our expected needs and availability of cash to pay our obligations. FFO attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income attributed to SIR or operating income as an indicator of our operating performance or as a measure of our liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributed to SIR and operating income as presented in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Our Operating Liquidity and Resources (dollars in thousands) 
    
  Our principal sources of funds to meet operating and capital expenses and debt service obligations and pay distributions on our common shares is rents from tenants at our properties and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses and debt service obligations and pay distributions on our common shares for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our ability to:  
             
    maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties; 
                
    control our operating expenses; and 
                
    purchase additional properties which produce cash flows in excess of our costs of acquisition capital and property operating expenses. 
       
  Our future purchases of properties cannot be accurately projected because such purchases depend upon purchase opportunities which come to our attention and our ability to successfully conclude the acquisitions. We generally do not intend to purchase  turn around  properties, or properties which do not generate positive cash flows. 
    
  Cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were $161,207, ($16,939) and ($145,447) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and $147,014, ($1,659,699) and $1,524,428 for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The increase in operating activities cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding prior year period is primarily due to increased operating cash flows from the properties we acquired during 2015. The decrease in cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding prior year period is primarily due to more acquisition activity during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   compared to the current year period. The decrease in financing activities cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding prior year period is primarily due to (i) the issuance of $1,450,000 aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in February 2015 and (ii) net activities on our revolving credit facility resulting primarily from our acquisitions during the 2015 period, partially offset by (iii) increased distributions to our common shareholders during the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period. 
    
  Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
    
  In order to fund acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of rents and our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating or capital expenses, we maintain a $750,000 unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders. The maturity date of our revolving credit facility is March 29, 2019 and, subject to our payment of an extension fee and meeting other conditions, we have the option to extend the stated maturity date  
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

by one year to March 29, 2020. We pay interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility at a rate of LIBOR plus a premium. We also pay a facility fee on the total amount of lending commitments under our revolving credit facility. Both the interest rate premium and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. At   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate premium on our revolving credit facility was 105 basis points and our facility fee was 20 basis points. We can borrow, repay and reborrow funds available under our revolving credit facility until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. As of   September 30, 2016  , the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 1.50%. As of   September 30, 2016   and October 24, 2016, we had $297,000 and $282,000, respectively, outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $453,000 and $468,000, respectively, available to borrow under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  We have a $350,000 unsecured term loan that matures on March 31, 2020 and is prepayable by us at any time without penalty. The term loan requires interest payable on the amount outstanding of LIBOR plus 115 basis points. The interest rate premium for the term loan is subject to adjustment based on changes to our credit ratings. As of   September 30, 2016  , the annual interest rate payable on borrowings under our term loan was 1.67%. 
    
  In addition, the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loan includes a feature under which the maximum borrowing availability under the facilities may be increased to up to $2,200,000 on a combined basis under certain circumstances. 
    
  Our debt maturities (other than our revolving credit facility and term loan) as of   September 30, 2016   were as follows: $40,318 in 2016, $17,570 in 2017, $350,304 in 2018, $4,926 in 2019, $501,172 in 2020 and $821,000 thereafter. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $16,697 of cash and cash equivalents. We typically use cash balances, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, net proceeds from offerings of equity or debt securities, term loans and the cash flows from our operations to fund debt repayments, property acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general business purposes. We also have in the past assumed mortgage debt in connection with certain of our acquisitions and we may do so in the future. In addition, we may sell properties we own or place mortgages on properties we own. 
    
  When significant amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility, or as the maturity of our credit facility, our term loan, our senior unsecured notes and our mortgage debts approach, we expect to explore alternatives for repaying or refinancing such amounts. Such alternatives may include incurring additional term debt and issuing new equity or debt securities. In addition, we may also seek to participate in joint ventures or other arrangements that may provide us additional sources of financing. Although we cannot be sure that we will be successful in consummating any particular type of financing, we believe that we will have access to financing, such as debt and equity offerings, to fund our committed and future acquisitions and capital expenditures and to pay our obligations. We currently have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities. 
    
  The completion and the costs of any future financings will depend primarily upon market conditions. The feasibility and cost of any future debt financings will depend primarily on credit markets and our then creditworthiness. We have no control over market conditions. Potential lenders in future debt transactions will evaluate our creditworthiness and our ability to fund required debt service and repay principal balances when they become due by reviewing our results of operations, financial condition, business practices and plans including our ability to maintain our earnings, to stagger our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably anticipated adverse changes. We intend to conduct our business in a manner which will continue to afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities, but we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully carry out this intention. 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid regular quarterly cash distributions to our common shareholders aggregating $134,961 using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. For further information regarding the distributions we paid during 2016, see Note 9 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
    
  On October 11, 2016, we declared a regular quarterly distribution of $0.51 per common share, or approximately $45,600, to shareholders of record on October 21, 2016. We expect to pay this distribution on or about November 17, 2016 using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
    
  During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, amounts capitalized for tenant improvements, leasing costs, building improvements and development and redevelopment activities were as follows (dollars in thousands):

     Table of Contents  

(1)   
    Tenant improvements include capital expenditures used to improve tenants  space or amounts paid directly to tenants to improve their space. 
       
            (2)   
    Leasing costs include leasing related costs, such as brokerage commissions, legal costs and tenant inducements. 
       
            (3)   
    Building improvements generally include (i) expenditures to replace obsolete building components and (ii) expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets. 
       
            (4)   
    Development, redevelopment and other activities generally include (i) capital expenditures that are identified at the time of a property acquisition and incurred within a short time period after acquiring the property and (ii) capital expenditure projects that reposition a property or result in new sources of revenues. 
       
  We have estimated unspent leasing related obligations of $27,623 as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , commitments made for expenditures, such as tenant improvements and leasing costs in connection with leasing space, were as follows (dollars and square feet in thousands, except per square foot amounts): 

(1)   
    Includes commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements, leasing commissions, tenant reimbursements and free rent. 
       
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements (dollars in thousands) 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We had no swaps or hedges as of   September 30, 2016  , other than the cash flow hedge associated with $41,000 of mortgage debt described in Notes 5 and 7 to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  included in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

     Table of Contents  

Debt Covenants (dollars in thousands) 
    
  Our principal debt obligations at   September 30, 2016   were our senior unsecured notes, borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan, and secured mortgage notes assumed in connection with some of our acquisitions. Our mortgage notes are non-recourse, subject to certain limitations, and do not contain any material financial covenants. Our publicly issued senior unsecured notes are governed by an indenture. Our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplement and the credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and term loan provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts outstanding upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, such as, in the case of our credit agreement, a change of control of us, which includes RMR LLC ceasing to act as our business manager and property manager. Our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplement and our credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and term loan contain a number of covenants which restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties, in excess of calculated amounts, restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and generally require us to maintain certain financial ratios. As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe we were in compliance with all of the terms and covenants under our revolving credit facility and term loan and senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplement. 
    
  Neither our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplement nor our credit agreement contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our credit agreement, our senior unsecured debt ratings are used to determine the fees and interest rates we pay. Accordingly, if our debt ratings are downgraded by certain credit rating agencies, our interest expense and related costs under our credit agreement would increase. 
    
  Our senior unsecured notes indenture and its supplement contain cross default provisions to any other debts of $25,000 or more. Similarly, our revolving credit facility and term loan have cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of $25,000 or more and indebtedness that is non-recourse of $50,000 or more. 
    
  Related Person Transactions 
    
  We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with RMR LLC, GOV and others related to them.  For example, we have no employees and the personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by RMR LLC pursuant to management agreements; RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC and we own shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc.; and the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc., ABP Trust, is owned by our Managing Trustees and ABP Trust also owns an equity interest in RMR LLC.  Also, GOV is our largest shareholder; and we and six other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services own in equal amounts AIC, an insurance company, and we participate in a combined property insurance program arranged and reinsured in part by AIC.  For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, please see Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  In addition, please see the section captioned  Risk Factors  of our Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships.  Our filings with the SEC and copies of certain of our agreements with these related parties are publicly available as exhibits to our public filings with the SEC and accessible at the SEC s website, www.sec.gov.  We may engage in additional transactions with related persons, including RMR LLC and companies to which RMR LLC or its affiliates provide management services. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     (  dollars in thousands  ) 
    
  We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is materially unchanged since December 31, 2015. Other than as described below, we do not currently expect any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding fixed rate debt consisted of the following senior unsecured notes and secured mortgage notes: 
    
  Fixed Rate Debt    
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

(1)   
    The principal balance, annual interest rate and annual interest expense are the amounts stated in the applicable contracts. In accordance with GAAP, our carrying value and recorded interest expense may differ from these amounts because of market conditions at the time we issued or assumed these debts. 
       
            (2)   
    Interest on this mortgage note is payable at a rate equal to a premium over LIBOR but has been fixed by a cash flow hedge which sets the rate at approximately 4.16% until August 3, 2020, which is the maturity date of the mortgage note. 
       
  Our senior unsecured notes require semi-annual interest payments through maturity. Some of our mortgage notes require principal and interest payments pursuant to amortization schedules and some of our mortgage notes require interest only payments through maturity. 
    
  We have an interest rate swap agreement that we assumed in connection with the CCIT Merger. This interest rate swap agreement manages our interest rate risk exposure on a $41,000 mortgage note due 2020, which requires us to pay interest at a rate equal to a premium over LIBOR. The interest rate swap agreement effectively modifies our exposure to interest rate risk arising from this floating rate mortgage loan by converting this floating rate debt to a fixed rate through August 3, 2020, which is the maturity date of the mortgage note, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. This agreement involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreement. Approximately 1.7% ($41,000) of our total outstanding debt had interest payments designated as hedged transactions to interest rate swap agreements at   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our derivative instrument included in accounts payable and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet was $1,920. 
    
  Because our senior unsecured notes and mortgage notes (including the current effect of our interest rate swap agreement) require interest to be paid at fixed rates, changes in market interest rates during the terms of these senior unsecured notes and mortgage notes will not affect our interest obligations. If these senior unsecured notes and mortgage notes were refinanced at interest rates which are 100 basis points higher or lower than shown above, our per annum interest cost would increase or decrease by approximately $16,951. 
    
  Changes in market interest rates would affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations, including obligations arising from our interest rate swap agreement. Increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our 
  fixed rate debt, while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt. Based on the balances outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and discounted cash flow analyses through the maturity dates, and assuming no other changes in factors that may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would change the fair value of these obligations by approximately $70,349. 
    
  Floating Rate Debt 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our floating rate debt (excluding the $41,000 mortgage note hedged by our interest rate swap agreement) consisted of $297,000 outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $350,000 outstanding under our term loan, and a $40,233 mortgage note. Our revolving credit facility matures on March 29, 2019 and, subject to our meeting certain conditions, including our payment of an extension fee, we have the option to extend the maturity date by one year to March 29, 2020. Our term loan matures on March 31, 2020. No principal repayments are required under our revolving credit facility or  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

term loan prior to maturity, and prepayments may be made at any time without penalty. Our $40,233 mortgage note matures on December 19, 2016 and requires monthly interest only payments through maturity. 
    
  Borrowings under our revolving credit facility, our term loan and our $40,233 floating rate mortgage note are in U.S. dollars and require interest to be paid at LIBOR plus a premium that is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to changes in U.S. dollar based short term rates, specifically LIBOR. In addition, upon renewal or refinancing of these obligations, we are vulnerable to increases in interest rate premiums due to market conditions or our perceived credit risk. Generally, a change in interest rates would not affect the value of our floating rate debt but would affect our operating results. The following table presents the approximate impact a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)   
    Weighted based on the respective interest rates and outstanding borrowings under our floating rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  . 
               (2)   
    Excludes our $41,000 mortgage note hedged by our interest rate swap agreement. 
               (3)   
    Based on the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  The following table presents the impact a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at   September 30, 2016   if we were fully drawn on our revolving credit facility and our term loan and floating rate mortgage note remained outstanding: 

(1)   
    Weighted based on the respective interest rates of our floating rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  , assuming we were fully drawn on our revolving credit facility and our term loan and floating rate mortgage note remained outstanding. 
               (2)   
    Excludes our $41,000 mortgage note hedged by our interest rate swap agreement. 
               (3)   
    Based on the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  The foregoing tables show the impact of an immediate increase in floating interest rates. If interest rates were to increase gradually over time, the impact would be spread over time. Our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount of our revolving credit facility, term loan or other floating rate debt. 
    
  Although we have no present plans to do so, we may in the future enter into additional hedge arrangements from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates. 

Item 4. Controls and     Procedures 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Managing Trustees, our President and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our Managing Trustees, our President and our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

    ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WITH OUR RELATED PARTIES, INCLUDING OUR MANAGING TRUSTEES, RMR LLC, RMR INC., GOV, SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST, AIC AND OTHERS AFFILIATED WITH THEM, AND 
                
    ACTS OF TERRORISM, OUTBREAKS OF SO CALLED PANDEMICS OR OTHER MANMADE OR NATURAL DISASTERS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. 
     FOR EXAMPLE: 
             
    OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND TO MAKE FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR FUTURE EARNINGS AND THE CAPITAL COSTS WE INCUR TO LEASE OUR PROPERTIES. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OR TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT RATE OF DISTRIBUTIONS ON OUR COMMON SHARES AND FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED, 
                
    OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND INCREASE OUR DISTRIBUTIONS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART UPON OUR ABILITY TO BUY PROPERTIES AND LEASE THEM FOR RENTS, LESS PROPERTY OPERATING COSTS, THAT EXCEED OUR CAPITAL COSTS. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY PROPERTIES THAT WE WANT TO ACQUIRE OR TO NEGOTIATE ACCEPTABLE PURCHASE PRICES, ACQUISITION FINANCING OR LEASE TERMS FOR NEW PROPERTIES, 
                
    CONTINGENCIES IN OUR ACQUISITION AND SALE AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE SATISFIED AND OUR PENDING ACQUISITIONS AND SALES MAY NOT OCCUR, MAY BE DELAYED OR THE TERMS OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY CHANGE, 
                
    RENTS THAT WE CAN CHARGE AT OUR PROPERTIES MAY DECLINE BECAUSE OF CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHERWISE, 
                
    A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR HAWAII PROPERTIES ARE LANDS LEASED FOR RENTS THAT ARE PERIODICALLY RESET BASED ON THEN CURRENT FAIR MARKET VALUES. REVENUES FROM OUR PROPERTIES IN HAWAII HAVE GENERALLY INCREASED DURING OUR OWNERSHIP AS THE LEASES FOR THOSE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN RESET OR RENEWED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM OUR HAWAII PROPERTIES WILL INCREASE AS A RESULT OF FUTURE RENT RESETS OR LEASE RENEWALS, AND FUTURE RENTS FROM THESE PROPERTIES COULD DECREASE OR NOT INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE IN THE PAST, 
                
    WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN FURTHER DIVERSIFYING OUR TENANTS, AND ANY DIVERSIFICATION WE MAY ACHIEVE MAY NOT MITIGATE OUR PORTFOLIO RISKS OR IMPROVE THE SECURITY OF OUR REVENUES OR OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, 
                
    OUR POSSIBLE REDEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OF OUR HAWAII PROPERTIES MAY NOT BE REALIZED OR BE SUCCESSFUL, 
                
    THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES MAY BECOME WORSE IN THE FUTURE. SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES OR OTHER CONDITIONS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR LEASING OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL SPACE. IF THE DEMAND FOR LEASING OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL SPACE IS REDUCED, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RENEW LEASES WITH OUR TENANTS AS LEASES EXPIRE OR ENTER INTO NEW LEASES AT RENTAL RATES AS HIGH AS EXPIRING RATES AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DECLINE, 
                
    OUR BELIEF THAT THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD THAT TENANTS MAY RENEW OR EXTEND OUR LEASES WHEN THEY EXPIRE WHENEVER THEY HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THE LEASED PROPERTIES, OR BECAUSE THOSE PROPERTIES MAY BE OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO THEM, MAY NOT BE REALIZED, 
                
    SOME OF OUR TENANTS MAY NOT RENEW EXPIRING LEASES, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN NEW TENANTS TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THE HISTORICAL OCCUPANCY RATES OF, OR RENTS FROM, OUR PROPERTIES,

     Table of Contents  

WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO PREPARE A PROPERTY FOR A TENANT, PARTICULARLY FOR SINGLE TENANT PROPERTIES, 
                
    CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SUBJECT TO OUR SATISFYING CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CREDIT FACILITY CONDITIONS THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SATISFY, 
                
    ACTUAL COSTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OR OTHER FLOATING RATE CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE HIGHER THAN LIBOR PLUS A PREMIUM BECAUSE OF OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH FACILITIES, 
                
    WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REPAY OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS WHEN THEY BECOME DUE, 
                
    THE MAXIMUM BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN MAY BE INCREASED TO UP TO $2.2 BILLION ON A COMBINED BASIS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES; HOWEVER, INCREASING THE MAXIMUM BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN IS SUBJECT TO OUR OBTAINING ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM LENDERS, WHICH MAY NOT OCCUR, 
                
    WE HAVE THE OPTION TO EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY UPON PAYMENT OF A FEE AND MEETING OTHER CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THE APPLICABLE CONDITIONS MAY NOT BE MET, 
                
    WE RECEIVED AN ASSESSMENT FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON FOR REAL ESTATE EXCISE TAX, INTEREST AND PENALTIES OF $2.8 MILLION ON CERTAIN PROPERTIES WE ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF CCIT IN JANUARY 2015. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE ARE EXEMPT FROM THIS TAX AND ARE DISPUTING THIS ASSESSMENT, WE MAY NOT SUCCEED IN HAVING ALL OR ANY PART OF THIS ASSESSMENT NULLIFIED, 
                
    THE BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN US AND RMR LLC HAVE CONTINUING 20 YEAR TERMS. HOWEVER, THOSE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE TERMS WHICH PERMIT EARLY TERMINATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR CONTINUING 20 YEAR TERMS OR FOR SHORTER TERMS, 
                
    WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR RELATED PARTIES, INCLUDING RMR LLC, RMR INC., GOV, SNH, AIC, AND OTHERS AFFILIATED WITH THEM MAY BENEFIT US AND PROVIDE US WITH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN OPERATING AND GROWING OUR BUSINESS. HOWEVER, THE ADVANTAGES WE BELIEVE WE MAY REALIZE FROM THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE, AND 
                
    THE PREMIUMS USED TO DETERMINE THE INTEREST RATE PAYABLE ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN AND THE FACILITY FEE PAYABLE ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ARE BASED ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS. FUTURE CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS MAY CAUSE THE INTEREST AND FEES WE PAY TO INCREASE. 
     CURRENTLY UNEXPECTED RESULTS COULD OCCUR DUE TO MANY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS ACTS OF TERRORISM, NATURAL DISASTERS, CHANGES IN OUR TENANTS  FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, THE MARKET DEMAND FOR LEASED SPACE OR CHANGES IN CAPITAL MARKETS OR THE ECONOMY GENERALLY.

Exhibit 10.1 

SELECT INCOME REIT 
  Share Award Agreement 
  This Share Award Agreement (this  Agreement ) is made as of  DATE , 2016, between  NAME  (the  Recipient ) and Select Income REIT (the  Company ). 
  In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  1.      Grant of Shares  .  Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth and the terms and conditions of the Select Income REIT 2012 Equity Compensation Plan, as it may be amended from time to time (the  Plan ), the Company hereby grants to the Recipient, effective as of the date of this Agreement,  NUMBER  of its common shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share (the  Common Shares ).  The shares so granted are hereinafter referred to as the  Shares,  which term shall also include any shares of the Company issued to the Recipient by virtue of his or her ownership of the Shares, by share dividend, share split or combination, recapitalization or otherwise. 
  2.      Vesting; Repurchase of Shares  . 
  (a)    Subject to Sections 2(b) and 2(c) hereof, the Shares shall vest one-fifth of the total number of Shares as of the date hereof and as to a further one-fifth of such total number of Shares on each anniversary of the date hereof for the next four calendar years.  Any Shares not vested as of any date are herein referred to as  Unvested Shares.  
  (b)    Subject to Section 2(c) hereof, at the option of the Company, in the event the Recipient ceases to render significant services, whether as an employee or otherwise, to (i) the Company, (ii) the entity which is the manager or shared services provider to the Company or an entity controlled by, under common control with or controlling such entity (collectively, the  Manager ), or (iii) an affiliate of the Company (which shall be deemed for such purpose to include any other entity to which the Manager is the manager or shared services provider), all or any portion of the Unvested Shares shall be forfeited by the Recipient as of the date the Recipient ceases to render all such services.  The Company may exercise such option by delivering or mailing to the Recipient (or his or her estate), at any time after the Recipient has ceased to render such services, a written notice of exercise of such option.  Such notice shall specify the number of Unvested Shares to be forfeited. 
  (c)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, immediately upon the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined below), all of the Unvested Shares shall vest and any forfeiture or other rights of the Company described in Section 2(b) shall lapse in their entirety, and such vesting and lapse of forfeiture or other Company rights shall also immediately apply to each other Common Share previously granted to the Recipient which then remains subject to comparable restrictions and rights.  For  
  
   {B2060228; 2} 

purposes of this Section 2(c), an Acceleration Event shall be deemed to occur immediately upon the occurrence of any of the following events: a Change in Control, a Termination Event (as each such term is defined in Exhibit A hereto) or the death of the Recipient. 
  3.      Legends  .  Vested and Unvested Shares granted under this Agreement may bear or contain, as applicable, such legends and notations as may be required by the Plan or the Company s declaration of trust, any applicable supplement thereto or bylaws, each as in effect from time to time, or as the Company may otherwise determine appropriate. 
  Promptly following the request of the Recipient with respect to any Shares (or any other Common Shares previously granted to the Recipient), the Company shall take, at its sole cost and expense, all such actions as may be required to permit the Recipient to sell such shares including, as applicable and without limitation, providing to the Company s transfer agent certificates of officers of the Company, and opinions of counsel and/or filing an appropriate registration statement, and taking all such other actions as may be required to remove the legends set forth above with respect to transfer and vesting restrictions from the certificates evidencing such shares and, if applicable, from the share books and records of the Company.  The Company shall reimburse the Recipient, promptly upon the receipt of a request for payment, for all expenses (including legal expenses) reasonably incurred by the Recipient in connection with the enforcement of the Recipient s rights under this paragraph.   
  4.      Tax Withholding  .  To the extent required by law, the Company or the Manager shall withhold or cause to be withheld income and other taxes incurred by the Recipient by reason of a grant of Shares, and the Recipient agrees that he or she shall, upon the request of the Company or the Manager, pay to the Company or to the Manager an amount sufficient to satisfy his or her tax withholding obligations from time to time (including as Shares become vested). 
  5.      Miscellaneous  . 
  (a)      Amendments  .  Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be changed or modified except by an agreement in writing executed by the Recipient and the Company; provided, however, that any change or modification that does not adversely affect the rights hereunder of the Recipient, as they may exist immediately prior to the effective date of such change or modification, may be adopted by the Company without an agreement in writing executed by the Recipient, and the Company shall give the Recipient written notice of such change or modification reasonably promptly following the adoption of such change or modification. 
  (b)      Binding Effect of the Agreement  .  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon , the Company, the Recipient and their respective estates, heirs, executors, transferees, successors, assigns and legal representatives. 
  (c)      Provisions Separable  .  In the event that any of the terms of this Agreement shall be or become or is declared to be illegal or unenforceable by any court or other authority of competent jurisdiction, such terms shall be null and void and shall be deemed  

deleted from this Agreement, and all the remaining terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 
  (d)      Notices  .  Any notice in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed to have been properly delivered if it is in writing and is delivered by hand or by facsimile or sent by registered certified mail, postage prepaid, to the party addressed as follows, unless another address has been substituted by notice so given:
