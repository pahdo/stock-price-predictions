NOTE 1     BASIS OF PRESENTATIO  N 

The interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ( interim statements ) of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Newmont  or the  Company ) are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of these interim statements have been included. The results reported in these interim statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be reported for the entire year. These interim statements should be read in conjunction with Newmont s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on February 17, 2016 on Form 10-K. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements and, in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q, certain information and footnote disclosures required by United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted. References to  A$  refers to Australian currency and  C$  refers to Canadian currency. 

On June 30, 2016, Newmont agreed to sell its 48.5% economic interest in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara ( PTNNT ), which operates the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine ( Batu Hijau ) in Indonesia (the  Batu Hijau Transaction ). Newmont concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, Batu Hijau met the criteria to be treated as held for sale and has been presented as a discontinued operation. Accordingly,  (i) Batu Hijau is reflected as held for sale in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015; (ii) our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows have been reclassified to present Batu Hijau as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and (iii) the amounts presented in these notes relate only to our continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 3. 

The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the 2016 presentation including the following items  : 

The Company retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-03, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. Refer to Note 2 for further details. 

The Company reclassified regional administrative and community development costs of $16 and $8 from   Other expense, net   to   General and administrative   and   Costs applicable to sales  , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and $42 and $18, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

NOTE 2     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Risks and Uncertainties  

As a global mining company, the Company s revenue, profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on prevailing prices for gold, copper and, to a lesser extent, silver. Historically, the commodity markets have been very volatile and there can be no assurance that commodity prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital and the quantities of reserves that the Company can economically produce. The carrying value of the Company s   Property, plant and mine development  ,    net;     Inventories;     Stockpiles and ore on leach pads   and   Deferred income tax assets   are sensitive to the outlook for commodity prices. A decline in the Company s long-term price outlook from current levels could result in material impairment charges related to these assets. 

On June 30, 2016, the Company, through its subsidiaries, entered into agreements to sell its 48.5% economic interest in PTNNT, which operates the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine in Indonesia. The closing of the sale is subject to various closing conditions, several of which were met during the third quarter of 2016. Certain closing conditions   

5 

Table of Contents  

NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION  

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited  ) 

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) 

remain outstanding and while the Company expects it is probable that those conditions will be successfully satisfied and the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of 2016, some of the remaining closing conditions are outside the control of the Company, and if not satisfied could result in the sale of PTNNT not being completed. See Note 3 below for a detailed description of the progress made resolving closing conditions during the third quarter of 2016  . 

In September 2014,   PTNNT and the Government of Indonesia signed a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) that resulted in the government agreeing to issue permits to allow PTNNT to export and sell copper concentrates from the Batu Hijau mine. The government has issued several six-month export permits since then, with the most recent permit expected to expire in November 2016. Additionally, negotiations between PTNNT and the Government of Indonesia to amend the Contract of Work (the investment agreement entered into by PTNNT and the Indonesian government in 1986, which includes the right to export copper concentrates and a prohibition against new taxes, duties, and levies) remained on-going at the time that the Company entered into the agreement to sell its interest in PTNNT. In the event that the sale of the Company s interest in PTNNT does not close prior to November 2016 or does not close at all, no assurances can be made with respect to the outcome of the Contract of Work negotiations and the renewal of the export permit. The failure to receive a timely renewal may negatively impact future operations and financial results a  t Batu Hijau. As a result of the on-going Contract of Work renegotiations at Batu Hijau, the need for asset impairments, inventory write-downs, tax valuation allowances and other applicable accounting charges will continue to be evaluated. At this time, the Company expects operations to continue into the future until the previously announced sale closes.  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. The Company must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information used is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 

The Company reports a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is probable and recognition of a completed sale is expected to occur within one year, the sales price is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and actions required to complete the sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn, in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment  . A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value less cost to sell, a loss is recognized. Assets and liabilities related to a business classified as held for sale are segregated in the current and prior balance sheets in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale. If a business is classified as held for sale after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued, the business continues to be classified as held and used in those financial statements when issued or when available to be issued. 

The Company reports the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if a disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity s operations and financial results when the business is classified as held for sale, in accordance with ASC 360,   Property, Plant and Equipment   and ASC 205-20,   Presentation of Financial Statements   -   Discontinued Operations  . The results of discontinued operations are reported in   Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax   in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for current and prior periods, including any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  

Employee benefit plan accounting 

In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2015-12 related to defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and health and welfare benefit plans. This update designates contract value as the only required measure for fully benefit-responsive investment contracts, simplifies and makes more effective the investment disclosure requirements for employee benefit plans and provides a simplified method for determining the measurement date for employee benefit plans. The update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this guidance, effective January 1, 2016, had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures. 

Fair value measurement 

In May 2015, ASU No. 2015-07 was issued related to investments for which fair value is measured, or is eligible to be measured, using the net asset value per share practical expedient. This update removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendment also removes certain disclosure requirements for these investments. This update will impact the annual disclosure related to pension plan assets measured at fair value. This update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this guidance, effective January 1, 2016, had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Debt issuance costs 

In April 2015, ASU No. 2015-03 was issued related to debt issuance costs. This update simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability. The update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.   The Company retrospectively adopted this guidance as of March 31, 2016. The Company reclassified $41 of debt issuance costs from   Other non-current assets   to   Debt   as of December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2015, balance sheet was adjusted as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-03 as follows: 

ASU No. 2015-03 does not specifically address the accounting for deferred financing costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. In August 2015, ASU No. 2015-15 was issued allowing for debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements to continue to be presented as assets. The Company will treat all debt issuance costs as a reduction to the carrying value of debt. 

Consolidations 

In February 2015, ASU No. 2015-02 was issued related to consolidations. This update makes some targeted changes to current consolidation guidance and impacts both the voting and the variable interest consolidation models. In particular, the update changes how companies determine whether limited partnerships or similar entities are variable interest entities. The update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company currently consolidates certain variable interest entities. A  doption of this guidance, effective January 1, 2016, had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

Statement of Cash Flows 

In August 2016, ASU No. 2016-15 was issued related to the statement of cash flows. This new guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. 

Stock-based compensation 

In   March 2016, ASU No. 2016-09 was issued related to stock-based compensation. The new guidance simplifies the accounting for stock-based compensation transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the updated guidance to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. 

Leases 

In   February 2016, ASU No. 2016-02 was issued related to leases. The new guidance modifies the classification criteria and requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from most leases on the balance sheet. This update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. 

Investments  

In January 2016, ASU No. 2016-01 was issued related to financial instruments. The new guidance requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income.   This new guidance also updates certain disclosure requirements for these investments. This update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company does not expect the updated guidance to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. 

Inventory 

In   July 2015, ASU No. 2015-11 was issued related to inventory, simplifying the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.   The Company does not expect the updated guidance to have an impact on the   Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures. 

Revenue recognition  

In May 2014, ASU No. 2014-09 was issued related to revenue from contracts with customers. This ASU was further amended in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016 by ASU No. 2015-14, No. 2016-08, No. 2016-10 and No. 2016-12, respectively. The new standard provides a five-step approach to be applied to all contracts with

customers and also requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. In August 2015, the effective date was deferred to reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, and will be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.  

NOTE 3     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 

The details of our   Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax   are set forth below: 

The Batu Hijau Transaction 

On June 30, 2016, Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V. (owned 56.25% by the Company and 43.75% by Nusa Tenggara Mining Corporation, majority owned by Sumitomo Corporation) entered into a   binding share sale and purchase agreement with PT Amman Mineral Internasional ( PTAMI ) to sell its 56% ownership interest in PTNNT, which operates the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine in Indonesia. In addition, NVL (USA) Limited ( NVL ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, (i) entered into a binding agreement to sell a loan made to PT Pukuafu Indah ( PTPI ), secured by PTPI s 17.8% interest in PTNNT, to PTAMI, and (ii) consented to PT Indonesia Masabaga Investama ( PTIMI ) selling its 2.2% interest in PTNNT to PTAMI with sale proceeds applied toward repayment of an NVL loan to PTIMI. Through these transactions, Newmont will effectively sell its 48.5% economic interest in PTNNT to PTAMI and will have no remaining interest. 

The sales proceeds to be received by the Company for its 48.5% economic interest in PTNNT includes $920 in cash attributable to Newmont to be received at closing, as well as contingent payments totaling up to $403 attributable to Newmont. The contingent payments include (i) a Metal Price Upside deferred payment of up to $133 attributable to Newmont, (ii) an Elang Development deferred payment of $118 attributable to Newmont and (iii) a Contingent Payment of up to $152 attributable to Newmont. The contingent payment amounts are determined based on certain metal price, shipment or project development criteria, as described below. 

The Metal Price Upside contingent payment of up to $133 attributable to Newmont is payable for any quarter in which the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) quarterly average copper price exceeds $3.75 per pound. It is calculated as 30% of the product of (i) the difference between the LME quarterly average copper price and $3.75 and (ii) 96.5% of the total pounds of copper contained in shipments of mineral products mined or produced from Batu Hijau that arrived in a buyers  or customers  designated port for delivery during the previous quarter. The Elang Development deferred payment totaling $118 attributable to Newmont is payable no later than the first anniversary of the first shipment of any form of saleable copper, gold or silver product produced from the Elang development area. The Contingent Payment of up to $152 attributable to Newmont is payable (i) as a payment of $76 attributable to Newmont if in any year after 2022 in which there is production from Phase 7 of the Batu Hijau mine and the LME annual average copper price is $2.75 or more per pound and (ii) if the full Contingent Payment amount has not already been paid, a payment of $76 attributable to Newmont in any year in which the LME annual average copper price in respect to such year is $3.25 or more per pound and after both the second anniversary of the first shipment of concentrate (or any other form of saleable copper, gold or silver product) produced from the Elang development area and December 31, 2023. The Company has

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) 

considered the Contingent Payment and the Elang Development deferred payment deeds to be derivatives under ASC 815 and they will be recorded at fair value upon completion of the sale. 

The sale of the Company s economic interest in PTNNT is subject to customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties, and is subject to various closing conditions. The following conditions precedent remain outstanding as of September 30, 2016: 

Valid export licensing at closing.   As required by the Indonesian government, PTNNT must hold a valid export license at closing. Newmont s current export permit is set to expire during November 2016.      

Closing of PTMDB s sale of its stake in PTNNT  . PT Multi Daerah Bersaing ( PTMDB ) is required to concurrently close the sale of their 24% interest in PTNNT to PTAMI, which is contingent on the restructuring of PTMDB loans. During the third quarter of 2016, the negotiations have progressed and as of September 30, 2016, it is the Company s expectation that the sale of the shares of PTMDB will close.      

The absence of any material adverse events.   Material adverse events include (i) an event that causes significant interruption of mining or milling operations of PTNNT for three months or longer, (ii) laws or regulations that prevent PTNNT from exporting its production outside of Indonesia for three months or longer, (iii) the revocation or termination of PTNNT s mineral rights and mining concessions with the Republic of Indonesia and (iv) any revocation, termination or suspension of PTNNT s export license. As of September 30, 2016, no material adverse events have occurred.     

The satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent in other transaction and finance-related agreements.   The sale of the PTIMI s 2.2% stake in PTNNT is expected to be completed without further complications.     

The following conditions precedent, outstanding as of June 30, 2016, were substantially resolved during the third quarter of 2016: 

Obtaining required Government approvals  . During the third quarter, the Government of Indonesia Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and Investment Coordinating Board approved the sale of PTNNT shares to PTAMI as required under the Sale and Purchase Agreement.     

Obtaining approval of PTNNT shareholders.   PTNNT shareholders were required to approve the transfer of shares in PTNNT to PTAMI and to appoint directors nominated by PTAMI. Shareholder approval was obtained and directors were nominated by PTAMI on September 30, 2016, satisfying this condition.      

Resolution of certain tax matters pertaining to PTNNT shareholder PTPI.   Prior to the third quarter of 2016, the shareholders of PTPI refused to engage with the Company to negotiate a resolution to the tax issues associated with their interest in PTNNT. These matters have since been substantially resolved. While some minor items remain outstanding related to the PTPI tax issue, the Company believes that those issues are within the control of the Company and can be resolved prior to closing.     

As described above, certain closing conditions remain outstanding and while the Company expects it is probable that those conditions will be successfully satisfied and the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of 2016, some of the remaining closing conditions are outside the control of the Company, and if not satisfied could result in the sale of PTNNT not being completed.

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) 

Based on the agreement to sell the economic interest in PTNNT, the Company evaluated the criteria under ASC 360 for classifying an asset as held for sale and concluded that as of September 30, 2016, PTNNT meets the criteria and has been presented as a discontinued operation. The Batu Hijau mine was previously included in the Asia Pacific operating segment. Newmont consolidates PTNNT as the primary beneficiary in the variable interest entity. 

As a result of classifying PTNNT as held for sale as of September 30, 2016, and in accordance with ASC 360, the Company compared the estimated fair value of the PTNNT disposal group to its carrying value and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value. Consequently the Company recorded a charge to   Loss on classification as held for sale   of $577 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The estimated fair value used in the determination of the   Loss on classification as held for sale   was determined using the estimated gross cash proceeds of $920, less selling costs and certain contingent payments deemed to be derivatives. The selling costs and estimated value of the derivatives are not expected to be material.  

Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of     tax   in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations that relates to Batu Hijau consists of the following: 

(1) 

Excludes   Depreciation and amortization   and   Reclamation and remediation.        

The consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) were not impacted by discontinued operations as PTNNT did not have any other comprehensive income (loss).

During the second quarter and third quarter, the Company paid $140 and $190, respectively, extinguishing the PTNNT revolving credit facility.  

The Holt Royalty Obligation 

Discontinued operations   include a retained royalty obligation ( Holt ) to Holloway Mining Company. Holloway Mining Company, which owned the Holt-McDermott property, was sold to St. Andrew Goldfields Ltd. ( St. Andrew ) in 2006. In January 2016, St. Andrew was acquired by Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. In 2009, the Superior Court issued a decision finding Newmont Canada Corporation ( Newmont Canada ) liable for a sliding scale royalty on production from the Holt property, which Newmont Canada appealed. In May 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court ruling finding Newmont liable for the sliding scale royalty, which equals 0.013% of net smelter returns multiplied by the quarterly average gold price, minus a 0.013% of net smelter returns. There is no cap on the sliding scale royalty and it will increase or decrease with changes in gold price, discount rate and gold production scenarios. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of the Holt sliding scale royalty was $225 and $129, respectively. Changes to the estimated fair value resulting from periodic revaluations are recorded to   Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a loss of $19 (net of a tax benefit of $9) and a loss of $72 (net of a tax benefit of $32), respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a gain of $17 (net of tax expense of $7) and a gain of $34 (net of tax expense of $15), respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid $8 and $9, respectively, related to the royalty.  

NOTE 4    BUSINESS ACQUISITION 

On June 8, 2015, the Company announced an agreement with AngloGold Ashanti Limited to acquire 100% ownership in the Cripple Creek   Victor ( CC V ) gold mining business in Colorado. CC V is a surface mine with heap leach operations that provides ore to a crusher and leaching facilities. During 2015, the Company received $675 in net proceeds from a common stock issuance. Newmont used the proceeds, supplemented with cash from the Company s balance sheet, to fund the acquisition. On August 3, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of CC V for $821, plus a 2.5% net smelter return royalty on future gold production from underground ore which had no fair value at the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred acquisition costs of $0 and $3, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, which were recorded in   Other expense, net  . The acquisition is not material to the Company's results of operations, individually or in the aggregate; as a result, no pro forma financial information is provided.  

During the second quarter of 2016, the final valuation of acquired assets and liabilities assumed was completed. There were no adjustments to the purchase price allocation since December 31, 2015. For further discussion of the CC V acquisition, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed February 17, 2016 on Form 10-K. 

NOTE 5     SEGMENT INFORMATION 

The Company has organized its operations into four geographic regions. The geographic regions include North America, South America, Asia Pacific and Africa and represent the Company s operating segments. The results of these operating segments are reviewed by the Company s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. As a result, these operating segments represent the Company s reportable segments. Notwithstanding this structure, the Company internally reports information on a mine-by-mine basis for each mining operation and has chosen to disclose this information on the following tables.   Income (loss) before income and mining tax and other items   from reportable segments does not reflect general corporate

expenses, interest (except project-specific interest) or income and mining taxes. Intercompany revenue and expense amounts have been eliminated within each segment in order to report on the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment performance. Newmont s business activities that are not considered operating segments are included in Corporate and Other. Although they are not required to be included in this footnote, they are provided for reconciliation purposes.  

Segment results for the prior periods have been retrospectively revised to reflect the following changes: 

In the first quarter of 2016, Merian was moved from Corporate and Other to the South America reportable segment as a result of the mine being included in the operating results and resource allocation of the South America segment.     

In the second quarter of 2016, Long Canyon was moved from Other North America to its own line item to reflect progression of the project and how it is being reported internally.      

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company concluded that Batu Hijau meets the criteria to be treated as held for sale. Batu Hijau has been removed from the Asia Pacific region and is presented as a discontinued operation in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 3.

NOTE 6     RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION  

The Company s mining and exploration activities are subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations to protect public health and the environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation and remediation costs are based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements.

The Company s   Reclamation and remediation   expense consisted of:  

The following are reconciliations of   Reclamation and remediation     liabilities  :   

The current portion of reclamation liabilities included in   Other current liabilities   was $28 and $29 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The current portion of remediation liabilities included in   Other current liabilities   was $34 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,  $1,349 and $1,300, respectively, were accrued for reclamation obligations relating to operating properties. In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,  $300 and $318, respectively, were accrued for such environmental remediation obligations.  

Non-current restricted assets held for purposes of settling reclamation and remediation obligations were $66 and $65 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Of the amount at September 30, 2016,  $43 is related to the Midnite Mine in Washington State, $14 is related to the Ahafo and Akyem mines in Ghana, Africa and $9 is related to the Con mine in Yellowknife, NWT, Canada. Of the amount at December 31, 2015,  $43 is related to the Midnite Mine in Washington State, $13 is related to the Ahafo and Akyem mines in Ghana, Africa and $9 is related to the Con mine in Yellowknife, NWT, Canada.  

Included in   Investments   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $21 and $20, respectively, of non-current equity securities, which are legally pledged for purposes of settling reclamation and remediation obligations related to the San Jose Reservoir in Yanacocha and for various locations in Nevada.

NOTE 9     INCOME AND MINING TAXES 

The Company s   Income and mining tax expense (benefit)   differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate for the following reasons:  

(1) 

Includes the reduction to percentage depletion and the domestic production deduction from the filing of the 2015 tax return during the second quarter of 2016.     

A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, each quarter, the Company considers future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, estimated future taxable income and taxable income in prior carryback year(s), as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction to determine if the deferred tax assets are realizable. If it is determined that the Company will not realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets, it will place or increase a valuation allowance. Conversely, if determined that it will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. There are a number of risk factors that could impact the Company s ability to realize the deferred tax assets.  

The Company operates in numerous countries and accordingly it is subject to, and pays taxes under, the various tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and pay the income taxes determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many countries are complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to an audit of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such audits, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company s business conducted within the country involved.  

At September 30, 2016, the Company s gross unrecognized tax benefit, including interest and penalties, was $131 for uncertain income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns. Of this, $79 represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company s effective income tax rate. 

During the second quarter of 2016, one of the Company s Canadian subsidiaries received a tax and interest assessment from the Canadian Revenue Authority for $54 relating to a pre-acquisition transaction of Fronteer Gold Inc. and subsidiaries. The taxing authority is disputing the tax attribute that was created as part of the pre-acquisition

transaction claimed on Fronteer s tax return. Due to procedural requirements, the Company paid half of the assessment in the third quarter. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position through all processes available.  

As a result of the statute of limitations that expire in the next 12 months in various jurisdictions and possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, none of which are individually significant, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its net unrecognized income tax benefits will decrease by approximately $25 to $30 in the next 12 months.  

NOTE 10     NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 

Newmont has a 51.35% ownership interest in Minera Yanacocha S.R.L., with the remaining interests held by Compa ia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%). Newmont consolidates Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements due to a majority voting interest. 

Newmont has a 29.20%   ownership interest in TMAC Resources Inc. ( TMAC )  , with the remaining interests held by TMAC management and various outside investors. Newmont s retained investment in TMAC is accounted for as an equity method investment. Refer to Note 16 for additional information. 

Newmont has a 75.0% economic interest in the development of the Merian project, with the remaining interests held by Staatsolie (a company wholly owned by the Republic of Suriname). Newmont consolidates the Merian project in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as the primary beneficiary in the variable interest entity. Newmont consolidates the Merian project through Newmont Suriname, LLC (formerly known as Surgold), a company wholly owned by Newmont. The project began construction in August 2014 and reached commercial production on October 1, 2016.  

According to the terms of the partnership agreement, Staatsolie will receive metal in kind for its 25% interest. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, Staatsolie and Newmont signed a letter of intent to amend the distribution model outlined in the partnership agreement which would allow Merian to sell 100% of the gold produced and make cash distributions in lieu of in kind distributions to Staatsolie.

NOTE 11    INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE  

Basic income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income available to Newmont common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per common share is computed similarly, except that weighted average common shares is increased to reflect all dilutive instruments, including employee stock awards and convertible debt instruments. The dilutive effects of Newmont s dilutive securities are calculated using the treasury stock method and only those instruments that result in a reduction in income per share are included in the calculation.  

Employee stock options to purchase 1 million and 2 million shares of common stock at weighted average exercise prices of $51 and $48 were outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted weighted average common shares because their exercise prices exceeded the average price of the Company s common stock for the respective periods presented.  

Newmont is required to settle the principal amount of its 2017 Convertible Senior Note in cash and may elect to settle the remaining conversion premium (average share price in excess of the conversion price), if any, in cash, shares or a combination thereof. The effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share is calculated under the net share settlement method. The conversion price exceeded the Company s share price for the periods presented; therefore, no additional shares were included in the computation of diluted weighted average common shares.

NOTE 14    FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING  

Fair value accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:  

Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;  

Level 2  Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and  

Level 3  Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

The following tables set forth the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  

(1) 

Restricted assets include cash and marketable securities whose carrying amounts approximate their fair value.      

(2) 

Debt, exclusive of capital leases, is carried at amortized cost. The outstanding carrying value was $5,099 and $5,842 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value measurement of debt was based on prices obtained from readily available pricing sources.

The fair values of the derivative instruments in the table above are presented on a net basis. The gross amounts related to the fair value of the derivatives instruments above are included in Note 15. All other fair value disclosures in the above table are presented on a gross basis.  

The Company s cash and cash equivalent instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The cash and cash equivalent instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.  

The Company s marketable equity securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and, as such, are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The securities are segregated based on industry. The fair value of the marketable equity securities is calculated as the quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the Company.  

The Company s marketable debt securities include investments in auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper. The Company reviews the fair value for auction rate securities and asset backed commercial paper on a quarterly basis. The marketable debt securities are traded in markets that are not active, trade infrequently and have little price transparency. Therefore, the investments are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See the table below which sets forth a summary of the quantitative and qualitative information related to the significant unobservable inputs used in the calculation of the fair value.  

The Company s net trade receivable from provisional copper and gold concentrate sales, subject to final pricing, is valued using quoted market prices based on forward curves and, as such, is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  

The Company s derivative instruments are valued using pricing models and the Company generally uses similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, forward curves, measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs. The Company s derivatives trade in liquid markets and, as such, model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  

The estimated value of the Boddington contingent royalty was determined using a (i) discounted cash flow model, (ii) Monte Carlo valuation model to simulate future gold and copper prices using the Company s long-term gold and copper prices and (iii) Monte Carlo valuation model to simulate costs applicable to sales using the Company s Australian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. This contingent royalty is capped at $100, of which $72 has been paid to date. The contingent royalty is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The estimated fair value of the Holt sliding scale royalty was determined using (i) a discounted cash flow model,  (ii) a Monte Carlo valuation model to simulate future gold prices using the Company s long-term gold price, (iii) various gold production scenarios from reserve and resource information and (iv) a weighted average discount rate. The sliding scale royalty liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 other than as a result of classifying PTNNT as held for sale. Level 3 inputs based on the estimated proceeds expected from the sale of PTNNT were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of PTNNT as of September 30, 2016.

NOTE 15    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS    

The Company s strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling its production at spot market prices. Consequently, the Company does not hedge its gold and copper sales. The Company has and will continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market.

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all derivative instruments held by the Company were subject to enforceable master netting arrangements held by various financial institutions. In general, the terms of the Company s agreements provide for offsetting of amounts payable or receivable between it and the counterparty, at the election of both parties, for transactions that occur on the same date and in the same currency. The Company s agreements also provide that in the event of an early termination, the counterparties have the right to offset amounts owed or owing under that and any other agreement with the same counterparty. The Company s accounting policy is to not offset these positions in its accompanying balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016, the potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities due to the master netting agreements was $2. As of December 31, 2015, all gross amounts presented in the accompanying balance sheets were in a liability position.

Provisional Gold and Copper Sales  

The Company s provisional gold and copper concentrate sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices  prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.  

At September 30, 2016, Newmont had gold and copper sales of 130,000 ounces and 26 million pounds priced at an average of $1,324 per ounce and $2.20 per pound, respectively, subject to final pricing over the next several months.

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) 

In March 2016, the Company sold its investment in Regis Resources Ltd. for $184, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $103 recorded in   Other income, net  . The   cost of the investment sold was determined using the specific identification method.  

In March 2016, Newmont participated in the TMAC offering acquiring 242,979 shares for C$2, maintaining its 29.37% ownership interest. During the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, Newmont s ownership interest was diluted to 29.2% due primarily to the exercising of warrants held by other shareholders. In July 2016, Newmont participated in a second offering acquiring an additional 1,159,000 shares for C$17.5, maintaining its 29.2% ownership interest. During 2015, Newmont determined that TMAC was no longer considered a variable interest entity and should no longer be consolidated into Newmont s financial results due to a number of financing events, which took place during the year. Newmont deconsolidated the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest related to TMAC and recognized a gain of $76, recorded within   Other income, net  ,     during the third quarter of 2015. The fair value of the retained investment was valued utilizing the market approach applying the initial public offering share price. Newmont s retained investment in TMAC is accounted for as an equity method investment. 

In September 2016,   Novo Resources Corp. ( Novo ) issued 765,115 common shares to Talga Resources Ltd. for payment of the purchase price for certain projects. As a result of the issuance of these additional shares, Newmont s ownership in Novo decreased to 19.97%. The Company determined that Novo no longer qualified as an equity method investment and is now accounting for this investment at fair value. At September 30, 2016, Newmont recognized an unrealized gain of $9 in   Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   related to Novo.  

There were no investment impairments for other-than-temporary declines in value during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   As of September 30, 2016, there was a $2  9   increase in the fair value of marketable securities previously impaired, primarily due to Gabriel Resources Ltd., Pilot Gold, Eurasian Minerals, Inc. and Loncor Resources, Inc.   During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized investment impairments for other-than-temporary declines in value of $  28   and $  101  , respectively, in   Other income, net  . Impairments recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2015, were primarily related to holdings of Gabriel Resources Ltd. for $21 and Pilot Gold for $7. Impairments recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, were primarily related to Regis Resources Ltd., Gabriel Resources Ltd. and Pilot Gold as a result of continued decline in stock prices.     As of September 30, 2015, there was a $  38   increase in the fair value of marketable securities previously impaired, primarily due to Regis Resources Ltd.  

The following tables present the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the Company s investments with unrealized losses that are deemed to be temporarily impaired, aggregated by length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position:

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded write-downs of $92 and $199, respectively, classified as components of   Costs applicable to sales,   and write-downs of $45 and $95, respectively, classified as components of   Depreciation and amortization   to reduce the carrying value of stockpiles and ore on leach pads to net realizable value. Adjustments to net realizable value are primarily a result of higher future processing costs in addition to stripping campaigns driving lower grade and lower recovery resulting in higher costs per unit in North America, higher future processing costs and lower expected recoveries in South America, and higher future processing costs in Africa. Of the write-downs during the three months ended September 30, 2016, $12 is related to Carlin, $1 to Twin Creeks, $77 to Yanacocha and $47 to Ahafo. Of the write-downs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $69 is related to Carlin, $14 to   Twin Creeks  , $164 to Yanacocha   and   $47 to Ahafo.  

NOTE 19    DEBT 

On March 29, 2016, the Company accepted for purchase approximately $274 of its 2019 Notes and $226 of its 2039 Notes through a debt tender offer. The Company recorded a net pre-tax loss of $4 in   Other income, net   as a result of the debt tender offer. Additionally, the Company reclassified $2 in   Interest expense, net   from   Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   related to the acceleration of the unrealized gains on the treasury rate lock contracts, which were entered into upon issuance of the Notes in 2009. 

On August 15, 2016, the Company paid the remaining principal balance on the Term Loan of $275. No premiums were paid as a result of early payment. 

Scheduled minimum debt repayments are $3 for the remainder of 2016,  $575 in 2017,  $nil in 2018,  $626 in 2019,  $nil in 2020 and $3,974 thereafter. Scheduled minimum capital lease repayments are $1 in 2016,  $5 in 2017,  $4 in 2018, $3 in 2019, $1 in 2020 and $3 thereafter.

NOTE 25    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

General  

Estimated losses from contingencies are accrued by a charge to income when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability could be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the contingency and estimated range of loss, if determinable, is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred.  

Operating Segments  

The Company s operating and reportable segments are identified in Note 5. Except as noted in this paragraph, all of the Company s commitments and contingencies specifically described herein are included in Corporate and Other. The Yanacocha matters relate to the South America reportable segment. The PTNNT matters relate to our discontinued operations that were previously included in the Asia Pacific reportable segment. See Note 3 for additional information. The Fronteer matters relate to the North America reportable segment.  

Environmental Matters  

The Company s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations so as to protect the public health and environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.  

Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. The Company reviews, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine.  

Accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs the Company will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. As mining operations progress over their mine life, the Company is able to more accurately predict the estimated future reclamation costs. Any such changes in future costs, the timing of reclamation activities, or scope could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation work required.  

In early 2015, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment ( MINAM ), issued proposed water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria would modify the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In December 2015, MINAM issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards and the Company has one year to submit a modification to the previously approved Environmental Impact Assessment which is due February 15, 2017. A total of up to four years are allowed for permitting, detailed engineering, and construction of water treatment facilities required for compliance with the new water quality standards. Yanacocha is currently assessing treatment options in connection with the new

Table of Contents  

NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION  

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited  ) 

(dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) 

water quality standards, which are expected to result in increased costs. If Yanacocha is unsuccessful in designing, constructing and implementing effective treatment options in the next four years, it could result in potential fines and penalties relating to potential intermittent non-compliant exceedances. 

The Company is also performing a comprehensive study of the current Yanacocha reclamation plan to update closure scope, timing and cost estimates while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. The Yanacocha closure study continued to progress the development of a revised reclamation plan during the third quarter of 2016 and is currently undergoing significant review and revision. As of September 30, 2016, the study team continued to evaluate and revise the assumptions and estimated costs of the potential changes to the closure plan with a focus on optimizing the approach to water treatment, earthworks, demolition and related support activities. The Company also continues to engage with communities and regulators in Peru to gather stakeholder feedback as the revised closure plan is developed and to ensure all regulatory requirements are met.  In conjunction with the Company s annual update process for all asset retirement obligations, the Company expects to record an adjustment to the Yanacocha reclamation liability in the fourth quarter of 2016 based on the planned progress of the closure study. The revised reclamation plan, once approved by management is expected to result in an increase in the reclamation obligation recorded at Yanacocha and this increase could be material.  Additionally, increases in the future reclamation costs at Yanacocha could result in a significant impact to   Income (loss) from continuing operations   from a potential impairment of the Yanacocha long-lived assets based on the current mine plans.  

For a complete discussion of the factors that influence our reclamation obligations and the associated risks, refer to Managements  Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading  Critical Accounting Policies  and refer to Risk Factors under the heading  Mine closure and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made  for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed February 17, 2016 on Form 10-K. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,  $1,349 and $1,300, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing mineral properties in accordance with asset retirement obligation guidance. The current portions of $28 and $29 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are included in   Other current liabilities  .   

In addition, the Company is involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites involved. The Company believes that the related environmental obligations associated with these sites are similar in nature with respect to the development of remediation plans, their risk profile and the compliance required to meet general environmental standards. Based upon the Company s best estimate of its liability for these matters, $300 and $318 were accrued for such obligations at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These amounts are included in   Other current liabilities   and   Reclamation and remediation liabilities  . Depending upon the ultimate resolution of these matters, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the liability for these matters could be as much as 46% greater or 1% lower than the amount accrued at September 30, 2016. The amounts accrued are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes in estimates are recorded in   Reclamation and remediation   in the period estimates are revised.  

Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding reclamation and remediation. Details about certain of the more significant matters are discussed below.  

Newmont USA Limited - 100% Newmont Owned

Prince of Wales, Alaska, and requested Newmont USA Limited pay those costs and perform an Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis ( EE/CA ) to assess what future response activities might need to be completed at the site. Newmont agreed to perform the EE/CA, which has been provided to the USFS. During the first quarter of 2016, the USFS confirmed approval of the EE/CA, and Newmont issued written notice to the USFS certifying that all requirements of the Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent ( ASAOC ) between the USFS and Newmont have been completed. The ASAOC will be final upon USFS concurrence with the notice of completion and Newmont payment of USFS response costs. Newmont anticipates that the USFS will issue an Action Memorandum to select the preferred Removal Action alternative identified in the EE/CA. During the third quarter, Newmont received a notice of completion of work per the ASAOC from the USFS. Newmont is currently in discussion with the USFS about the next steps with regard to the Removal Action, which includes discussion of the response costs incurred thus far. The approach is to incorporate the past USFS costs as well as future USFS oversight costs into an agreement between Newmont and USFS to complete the Removal Action. The current discussions with USFS are and will be focused, during the fourth quarter of 2016, on the process to move forward with an Action Memorandum and an agreement between Newmont and USFS to complete the Removal Action now that the USFS has confirmed approval of the EE/CA. It is anticipated that the process to move forward will be clarified with the USFS during the fourth quarter. Any future liability associated with the Ross-Adams site would be subject to future negotiations with the USFS. Upon USFS issuing the Action Memorandum, Newmont will resume discussions with another potential responsible party to discuss possible allocation of future costs for implementing the remedy. No assurances can be made at this time with respect to the outcome of such negotiations and Newmont cannot predict the likelihood of additional expenditures related to this matter. 

Dawn Mining Company LLC ( Dawn ) - 51% Newmont Owned

The mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ).  

As per the Consent Decree approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington on January 17, 2012, the following actions were required of Newmont, Dawn, the Department of the Interior and the EPA: (i) Newmont and Dawn would design, construct and implement the cleanup plan selected by the EPA in 2006 for the Midnite Mine site; (ii) Newmont and Dawn would reimburse the EPA for its costs associated with overseeing the work; (iii) the Department of the Interior would contribute a lump sum amount toward past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite Mine site; (iv) Newmont and Dawn would be responsible for all other EPA oversight costs and Midnite Mine site cleanup costs and (v) Newmont would post a surety bond for work at the site.  

During 2012, the Department of Interior contributed its share of past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite Mine site in a lump sum payment of $42, which Newmont classified as restricted assets with interest on the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. Additionally in 2012, Newmont initiated the remedial design process and subsequently submitted interim process update reports at the 30% design, 60% design and 90% design level of completion, which were approved by the EPA in July 2012, April 2014 and April 2015, respectively. Upon approval by the EPA of the 90% design coupled with the resolution of uncertainties regarding site access and material use, the expected remediation design was reasonably certain and Newmont commissioned an independent cost estimate of the overall project costs based on the 90% design. The remediation liability for the Midnite Mine site and Mill site is approximately $209 at September 30, 2016.

Other Legal Matters  

Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. - 51.35% Newmont Owned  

Choropampa  . In June 2000, a transport contractor of Yanacocha spilled approximately 151 kilograms of elemental mercury near the town of Choropampa, Peru, which is located 53 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of the Yanacocha mine. Elemental mercury is not used in Yanacocha s operations but is a by-product of gold mining and was sold to a Lima firm for use in medical instruments and industrial applications. A comprehensive health and environmental remediation program was undertaken by Yanacocha in response to the incident. In August 2000, Yanacocha paid under protest a fine of 1,740,000 Peruvian soles (approximately $0.5)  to the Peruvian government. Yanacocha has entered into settlement agreements with a number of individuals impacted by the incident. As compensation for the disruption and inconvenience caused by the incident, Yanacocha entered into agreements with and provided a variety of public works in the three communities impacted by this incident. Yanacocha cannot predict the likelihood of additional expenditures related to this matter.  

Additional lawsuits relating to the Choropampa incident were filed against Yanacocha in the local courts of Cajamarca, Peru, in May 2002 by over 900 Peruvian citizens. A significant number of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits entered into settlement agreements with Yanacocha prior to filing such claims. In April 2008, the Peruvian Supreme Court upheld the validity of these settlement agreements, which the Company expects to result in the dismissal of all claims brought by previously settled plaintiffs. Yanacocha has also entered into settlement agreements with approximately 350 additional plaintiffs. The claims asserted by approximately 200 plaintiffs remain. In 2011, Yanacocha was served with 23 complaints alleging grounds to nullify the settlements entered into between Yanacocha and the plaintiffs. Yanacocha has answered the complaints and the court has dismissed several of the matters and the plaintiffs have filed appeals. All appeals were referred to the Civil Court of Cajamarca, which affirmed the decisions of the lower court judge. The plaintiffs have filed appeals of such orders before the Supreme Court. Some of these appeals were dismissed by the Supreme Court in favor of Yanacocha and others are pending resolution. Yanacocha will continue to vigorously defend its position. Neither the Company nor Yanacocha can reasonably estimate the ultimate loss relating to such claims.  

Administrative Actions  . The Peruvian government agency responsible for environmental evaluation and inspection, Organismo Evaluacion y Fiscalizacion Ambiental ( OEFA ), conducts periodic reviews of the Yanacocha site. In 2011, 2012, 2013, the first quarter of 2015 and second and third quarters of 2016, OEFA issued notices of alleged violations of OEFA standards to Yanacocha and Conga relating to past inspections. OEFA has resolved some alleged violations with minimal or no findings. Total fines for all outstanding OEFA alleged violations remain dependent upon the number of units associated with the alleged violations. In the first quarter of 2015, the water authority of Cajamarca issued notices of alleged regulatory violations. The alleged OEFA violations currently range from zero to 40,677 units and the water authority alleged violations range from zero to 20,000 units, with each unit having a potential fine equivalent to approximately $.00118  ($0 to $71). Yanacocha and Conga are responding to all notices of alleged violations, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the agency allegations.  

Conga Project Constitutional Claim  . On October 18, 2012, Marco Antonio Arana Zegarra filed a constitutional claim against the Ministry of Energy and Mines and Yanacocha requesting the Court to order the suspension of the Conga project as well as to declare not applicable the October 27, 2010, directorial resolution approving the Conga project Environmental Impact Assessment ( EIA ). On October 23, 2012, a Cajamarca judge dismissed the claims based on formal grounds finding that: (i) plaintiffs had not exhausted previous administrative proceedings; (ii) the directorial resolution approving the Conga EIA is valid, and was not challenged when issued in the administrative proceedings; (iii) there was inadequate evidence to conclude that the Conga project is a threat to the constitutional right of living in an adequate environment and; (iv) the directorial resolution approving the Conga project EIA does not guarantee that the Conga project will proceed, so there was no imminent threat to be addressed by the Court. The plaintiffs appealed the

dismissal of the case. The Civil Court of the Superior Court of Cajamarca confirmed the above mentioned resolution and the plaintiff presented an appeal. On March 13, 2015, the Constitutional Court published its ruling stating that the case should be sent back to the first court with an order to formally admit the case and start the judicial process in order to review the claim and the proofs presented by the plaintiff. Yanacocha has answered the claim. Neither the Company nor Yanacocha can reasonably predict the outcome of this litigation. 

Yanacocha Tax Dispute.   In 2000, Yanacocha paid Buenaventura and Minas Conga S.R.L. a total of $29 to assume their respective contractual positions in mining concession agreements with Chaupiloma Dos de Cajamarca S.M.R.L. The contractual rights allowed Yanacocha the opportunity to conduct exploration on the concessions, but not a purchase of the concessions. The tax authority alleges that the payments to Buenaventura and Minas Conga S.R.L. were acquisitions of mining concessions requiring the amortization of the amounts under the Peru Mining Law over the life of the mine. Yanacocha expensed the amounts at issue in the initial year since the payments were not for the acquisition of a concession but rather these expenses represent the payment of an intangible and therefore, amortizable in a single year or proportionally for up to ten years according to Income Tax Law. In 2010, the tax court in Peru ruled in favor of Yanacocha and the tax authority appealed the issue to the judiciary. The first appellate court confirmed the ruling of the tax court in favor of Yanacocha. However, in November, 2015, a Superior Court in Peru made an appellate decision overturning the two prior findings in favor of Yanacocha. Yanacocha has appealed the Superior Court ruling to the Peru Supreme Court. The potential liability in this matter is in the form of fines and interest in an amount up to $75. While the Company has assessed that the likelihood of a ruling against Yanacocha in the Supreme Court as remote, it is not possible to fully predict the outcome of this litigation. 

PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara   31.5% Newmont Owned  

Under the Batu Hijau Contract of Work, beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2010, a portion of PTNNT s shares were required to be offered for sale, first, to the Indonesian government or, second, to Indonesian nationals, equal to the difference between the following percentages and the percentage of shares already owned by the Indonesian government or Indonesian nationals (if such number is positive): 23% by March 31, 2006; 30% by March 31, 2007; 37% by March 31, 2008; 44% by March 31, 2009; and 51% by March 31, 2010. As PTPI, an Indonesian national, owned a 20% interest in PTNNT at all relevant times, in 2006, a 3% interest was required to be offered for sale and, in each of 2007 through 2010, an additional 7% interest was required to be offered (for an aggregate 31% interest). The price at which such interests were offered for sale to the Indonesian parties was the fair market value of such interest considering PTNNT as a going concern, as agreed with the Indonesian government. Following certain disputes and an arbitration with the Indonesian government, in November and December 2009, sale agreements were concluded pursuant to which the 2006, 2007 and 2008 shares were sold to PT Multi Daerah Bersaing ( PTMDB ), the nominee of the local governments, and the 2009 shares were sold to PTMDB in February 2010, resulting in PTMDB owning a 24% interest in PTNNT.  

On December 17, 2010, the Ministry of Energy   Mineral Resources, acting on behalf of the Indonesian government, accepted the offer to acquire the final 7% interest in PTNNT. Subsequently, the Indonesian government designated Pusat Investasi Pemerintah ( PIP ), an agency of the Ministry of Finance, as the entity that will buy the final stake. On May 6, 2011, PIP and the foreign shareholders entered into a definitive agreement for the sale and purchase of the final 7% divestiture stake, subject to receipt of approvals from certain Indonesian government ministries. Subsequent to signing the agreement, a disagreement arose between the Ministry of Finance and the Indonesian parliament in regard to whether parliamentary approval was needed to allow PIP to make the share purchase. In July 2012, the Constitutional Court ruled that parliament approval is required for PIP to use state funds to purchase the shares, which approval was never obtained. PIP and the foreign shareholders have not further extended the period in the definitive agreement for satisfaction of the conditions. Further disputes may arise in regard to the divestiture of the 2010 shares.  

Refer to Note 3 for additional information regarding the anticipated sale of PTNNT.

NWG Investments Inc. v. Fronteer Gold Inc.  

In April 2011, Newmont acquired Fronteer Gold Inc. ( Fronteer ).  

Fronteer acquired NewWest Gold Corporation ( NewWest Gold ) in September 2007. At the time of that acquisition, NWG Investments Inc. ( NWG ) owned approximately 86% of NewWest Gold and an individual named Jacob Safra owned or controlled 100% of NWG. Prior to its acquisition of NewWest Gold, Fronteer entered into a June 2007 lock-up agreement with NWG providing that, among other things, NWG would support Fronteer s acquisition of NewWest Gold. At that time, Fronteer owned approximately 47% of Aurora Energy Resources Inc. ( Aurora ), which, among other things, had a uranium exploration project in Labrador, Canada. 

NWG contends that, during the negotiations leading up to the lock-up agreement, Fronteer represented to NWG, among other things, that Aurora would commence uranium mining in Labrador by 2013, that this was a firm date, that Aurora faced no current environmental issues in Labrador and that Aurora s competitors faced delays in commencing uranium mining. NWG further contends that it entered into the lock-up agreement and agreed to support Fronteer s acquisition of NewWest Gold in reliance upon these purported representations. On October 11, 2007, less than three weeks after the Fronteer-NewWest Gold transaction closed, a member of the Nunatsiavut Assembly introduced a motion calling for the adoption of a moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. On April 8, 2008, the Nunatsiavut Assembly adopted a three-year moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. NWG contends that Fronteer was aware during the negotiations of the NWG/Fronteer lock-up agreement that the Nunatsiavut Assembly planned on adopting this moratorium and that its adoption would preclude Aurora from commencing uranium mining by 2013, but Fronteer nonetheless fraudulently induced NWG to enter into the lock-up agreement.  

On September 24, 2012, NWG served a summons and complaint on the Company, and then amended the complaint to add Newmont Canada Holdings ULC as a defendant. The complaint also named Fronteer Gold Inc. and Mark O Dea as defendants. The complaint sought rescission of the merger between Fronteer and NewWest Gold and $750 in damages. In August 2013 the Supreme Court of New York, New York County issued an order granting the defendants  motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens. Subsequently, NWG filed a notice of appeal of the decision and then a notice of dismissal of the appeal on March 24, 2014.  

On February 26, 2014, NWG filed a lawsuit in Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Fronteer Gold Inc., Newmont Mining Corporation, Newmont Canada Holdings ULC, Newmont FH B.V. and Mark O Dea. The Ontario complaint is based upon substantially the same allegations contained in the New York lawsuit with claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. NWG seeks disgorgement of profits since the close of the NWG deal on September 24, 2007 and damages in the amount of C$1.2 billion. Newmont, along with other defendants, served the plaintiff with its statement of defense on October 17, 2014. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome. 

Investigations 

We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in unlawful conduct for which we might be held responsible. We are conducting an investigation, with the assistance of outside counsel, relating to certain business activities of the Company and its affiliates and contractors in countries outside the U.S. The investigation includes a review of compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws and regulations. The Company is working with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the investigation. In March 2016, the Company entered into a one-year agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission tolling the statute of limitations relating to the investigation, and in April 2016, entered into a similar

agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Both of the initial tolling agreements were effective through October 29, 2016. In September 2016, the Company agreed to extend its tolling agreement with the Department of Justice through April 2017, and agreed to a similar extension with the Securities and Exchange Commission in October 2016.  As of the filing of these financial statements, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. Accordingly, no provision with respect to these matters has been made in our consolidated financial statements. See also Item 1A of the Company s most recent Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2016, under the heading  Our business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other extraterritorial and domestic anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and other collateral consequences and reputational harm.  

Other Commitments and Contingencies  

The Company has minimum royalty obligations on one of its producing mines in Nevada for the life of the mine. Amounts paid as a minimum royalty (where production royalties are less than the minimum obligation) in any year are recoverable in future years when the minimum royalty obligation is exceeded. Although the minimum royalty requirement may not be met in a particular year, the Company expects that over the mine life, gold production will be sufficient to meet the minimum royalty requirements. Royalty payments payable, net of recoverable amounts, are $28 in 2016,  $30 in 2017,  $30 in 2018,  $31 in 2019,  $33 in 2020 and $69 thereafter.  

On June 25, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 33.33% interest in Boddington from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited ( AngloGold ). Consideration for the acquisition consisted of $982 and a contingent royalty capped at $100, equal to 50% of the average realized operating margin (Revenue less Costs applicable to sales on a by-product basis), if any, exceeding $600 per ounce, payable quarterly beginning in the second quarter of 2010 on one-third of gold sales from Boddington. At the acquisition date, the Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration at $62. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of the unpaid contingent consideration was approximately $21 and $10, respectively. Changes to the estimated fair value resulting from periodic revaluations are recorded to   Other expense, net  . This contingent royalty is capped at $100 in aggregate payments, of which $72 has been paid to date. The Company has made no payments during 2016 and 2015; however, the Company expects to pay $10 in the next 12 months. The range of remaining undiscounted amounts the Company could pay is between $0 and $28. 

As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for various purposes, including environmental reclamation, exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were $2,168 and $2,060, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The surety bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees reflect fair value as a condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to fees competitively determined in the market place. The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company addresses through its ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure. Generally, bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. However, the Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements through existing or alternative means, as they arise.  

Newmont is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. Except in the above described proceedings, management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 2.       MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)  

The following Management s Discussion and Analysis ( MD A ) provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Mining Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Newmont,  the  Company,   our  and  we ). We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in our MD A. For a detailed description of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this MD A, please see the discussion under  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  beginning on page   79. References to  A$  refers to Australian currency.  

This item should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this quarterly report. Additionally, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations   and the consolidated financial statements included in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed February 17, 2016. 

Overview    

Newmont is one of the world s largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S P 500 Index and Fortune 500. We have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World for ten consecutive years and have adopted the World Gold Council s Conflict-Free Gold Policy. We are also engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold and copper properties. We have significant operations and/or assets in the United States ( U.S. ), Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana and Suriname.  

On June 30, 2016, Newmont agreed to sell its 48.5% economic interest in PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara ( PTNNT ), which operates the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine ( Batu Hijau ) in Indonesia (the  Batu Hijau Transaction ). Newmont concluded that as of September 30, 2016, Batu Hijau met the criteria to be treated as held for sale and has been presented as a discontinued operation. In the following discussion and analysis, the operating statistics, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that we present and discuss are those of our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion in our   Consolidated Financial Results   and   Results of Consolidated Operations   below. 

We continue to focus on improving safety and efficiency at our operations, maintaining leading environmental, social and governance practices, and building a stronger portfolio of longer-life, lower cost mines to generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt, and return cash to shareholders. As part of these efforts  , we launched the Full Potential program ( Full Potential ) in 2013 which continues to deliver results in the current year. Full Potential is designed to leverage our industry experience and discipline to accelerate the delivery of business improvement opportunities across our operations and support areas, resulting in improved levels of operating cash flow.

Our global project pipeline  

Projects included in our global pipeline comprise an important part of the Company s growth strategy and reflect opportunities throughout the development cycle. The most advanced projects, including early stage development and projects in or near the execution phase, are described below. The exploration, construction and execution of these projects may require significant funding to complete.    

Merian, Suriname  . The Merian project in Suriname reached commercial production on October 1, 2016. We expect average estimated gold production (on a 100% basis) of 400,000 to 500,000 ounces per year for the first five full years, beginning in 2017. Development capital costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $441 on an attributable basis, of which   $41   of these costs are related to the third quarter of 2016. Total development capital on an attributable basis at the completion of the Merian project is expected to be $525 on an attributable basis. At December 31, 2015, we reported 110.6 million tons of probable reserves, grading 0.035 ounces per ton for 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on an attributable basis at Merian.  

Long Canyon, Nevada  .    The Board of Directors approved full funding for the first phase of developing the Long Canyon project in the second quarter of 2015. The Environmental Impact Statement Record of Decision was issued by the Bureau of Land Management on April 7, 2015. The project is now in commissioning and is expected to achieve commercial production by the end of 2016. We estimate that production will be between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces per year over an eight year mine life. Development c  apital costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $192, of which $26 are related to the third quarter.   At December 31, 2015, we reported 18 million tons of probable reserves, grading 0.067 ounce per ton for 1.2 million ounces of gold reserves at Long Canyon.  

Tanami Expansion, Australia.   The Board of Directors approved full funding of the Tanami Expansion project on October 28, 2015. The scope for this project includes a ventilation upgrade, additional mining equipment, additional   

55 

Table of Contents  

mine access and increasing process plant capacity and recovery. We expect the Tanami Expansion to reach commercial production by mid-2017, which will maintain Tanami production of between 425,000 and 475,000 gold ounces for the first five years. Development capital costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $51, of which $11 are related to the third quarter of 2016.  

Cripple Creek   Victor ( CC V ) Expansion, Colorado.   An expansion project at CC V, which will extend CC V s estimated mine life to at least 2026, includes the construction of a new leach pad, mill and recovery plant. The mill was mechanically completed in the first quarter of 2015. The new leach pad and the recovery plant are now complete, and production will continue to ramp up through 2016. Development capital costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $103, of which $9 are related to the third quarter of 2016. Total development capital at completion is expected to be $185. 

NW Exodus, Nevada  . In June 2016, Newmont approved the Northwest Exodus Underground project. The Northwest Exodus gold deposit is located in close proximity to the Exodus deposit in Newmont s Carlin North Area, Eureka County, Nevada, within the mine plan (Genesis-Blue Star Plan of Operations). The Project expands the existing Exodus Underground mine infrastructure. Incremental gold production will average between 50,000 and 75,000 ounces per year for the first five years. First gold production was achieved in August 2016. Sustaining capital costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were $13, of which $6 are related to the third quarter of 2016.  

Subika Underground, Ghana  . Subika Underground is in the definitive feasibility stage of development as work continues to optimize the mine plan and reduce costs. The project would increase profitable production by 150,000 to 200,000 ounces of gold per year for the first five years and an investment decision is expected in late 2016. 

Ahafo Mill Expansion, Ghana  . Ahafo Mill Expansion is in the definitive feasibility stage of development as we continue to refine the scope and look for ways to reduce costs. The project would increase profitable production by an average of 75,000 to 100,000 ounces of gold per year for the first five years while lowering costs and off-setting the impacts of lower grades and harder ore. An investment decision is expected in late 2016. 

Goldstar, Nevada.   In October 2016, Newmont approved the Goldstar project. Goldstar is a layback in the Carlin North area with a seven year life that is expected to deliver over 500,000 ounces of production over a 13 year period.  

We manage our wider project portfolio to maintain flexibility to address the development risks associated with our projects including permitting, local community and government support, engineering and procurement availability, technical issues, escalating costs and other associated risks that could adversely impact the timing and costs of certain opportunities.

Consolidated Financial Results    

The details of our   Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders   are set forth below: 

Results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 were impacted by higher realized gold prices, partially offset by higher operating costs, a prior-year gain resulting from the deconsolidation of TMAC Resources Inc. ( TMAC ), a prior-year gain resulting from the sale of the Company s investment in European Gold Refinery Holdings ( EGR ) and lower gold sales volumes.

The details of our   Costs applicable to sales   are set forth below: 

The increase in   Costs applicable to sales   for gold during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to the addition of CC V, an unfavorable Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate and higher stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments, partially offset by the sale of Waihi, lower sales volumes and lower oil prices. The increase in   Costs applicable to sales   for gold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to the addition of CC V and higher stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments, partially offset by the sale of Waihi, lower sales volumes, a favorable Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate and lower oil prices. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, gold production and co-product allocation of costs to gold remained relatively constant. 

Costs applicable to sales   for copper remained relatively flat during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.   

For discussion regarding variations in operations, see   Results of Consolidated Operations   below.

stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments, partially offset by the sale of Waihi and lower sales volumes.    

Depreciation and amortization   for copper remained relatively flat during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015  . 

Other  income, net   decreased by $146 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to prior year gains of $76 from the deconsolidation of TMAC, $53 from the sale of our equity stake in EGR and foreign exchange movements, partially offset by higher impairments of marketable securities in the prior year.    Other income, net   decreased by $43 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to prior year gains of $76 from the deconsolidation of TMAC, $38 from the sale of Hemlo mineral rights, $53 from the sale of our equity stake in EGR,  and foreign exchange movements. This was partially offset by current year gains of $103 on the sale of the Company s investment in Regis Resources Ltd. and lower impairment charges on investments.  

The Company s   Income and mining tax expense (benefit)   consisted of:  

(1) 

Includes the reduction to percentage depletion and the domestic production deduction from the filing of the 2015 tax return during the second quarter of 2016.     

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, income and mining tax expense was $90, resulting in an effective tax rate of 40%. Income and mining tax expense during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $61, for an effective tax rate of 26%. The Company s effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors as illustrated in the table above. The most impactful is the change in the Company s valuation allowance. The Company recorded a relatively large reduction to its valuation allowance for tax credits in the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the settlement of income tax audits.   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, income and mining tax expense was $555, resulting in an effective tax rate of 83%. Income and mining tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $291, for an effective tax rate of 48%. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to changes in the Company s

valuation allowance. In 2016, the Company increased its valuation allowance for tax credits generated by a restructuring implemented for tax planning purposes and by a carry back of taxable losses to a year with taxable income.  

There are a number of factors that can potentially impact the Company s effective tax rate, including the geographic distribution of income, the non-recognition of tax assets, percentage depletion, changes in tax laws and the impact of specific transactions and assessments. For a complete discussion of the factors that influence our effective tax rate, see   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations   for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed February 17, 2016 on Form 10-K. 

Due to the factors discussed above and the sensitivity of the Company s income tax expense and effective tax rate to these factors, it is expected that the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, in future periods.  

The details of our   Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax   are set forth below:

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  

Foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profit margins and   Costs applicable to sales   to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies. Such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our revenue since gold and copper are sold throughout the world principally in U.S. dollars. Despite selling gold and copper in London, we have no exposure to the euro or the British pound. 

Our foreign operations sell their gold and copper production based on U.S. dollar metal prices.   Approximately 32% and 27% of   Costs applicable to sales   for our foreign operations were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which approximately 28% was denominated in the Australian dollar in the current year.   Approximately 33% and 31% of   Costs applicable to sales   for our foreign operations were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,   of which approximately 29% was denominated in the Australian dollar in the current year  . Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased   Costs applicable to sales   by approximately $1 per ounce, net of hedging losses, during the three months ended September 30, 2016,  compared to the same period in 2015. Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased   Costs applicable to sales   by approximately $12 per ounce, net of hedging losses, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, of which Australia accounted for approximately $11 per ounce of the total decrease.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

Liquidity Overview 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents decreased from $2,363 to $2,099. The net cash outflow of $264 was primarily used for $832 for additions to property, plant and mine development, $777 of debt repayments at Corporate, $146 for dividends paid to noncontrolling interests at Yanacocha and $20 in net outflows of other investing and financing activities. These outflows were partially offset by operating cash flows from continuing operations of $1,327 in addition to proceeds received from the sale of Regis Resources Ltd. of $184.  

Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows: 

Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations   was $1,327 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $23 from the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to higher average realized gold prices resulting in higher sales, partially offset by unfavorable movements in working capital, slightly higher operating costs and lower average realized copper prices. 

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations   decreased to $702 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,652 during the same period in 2015. Details of investing activities are below:

Scheduled minimum debt and capital lease repayments are $3 for the remainder of 2016,  $575 in 2017,  $nil in 2018,  $626 in 2019,  $nil in 2020 and $3,974 thereafter. We generally expect to be able to fund maturities of debt from   Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations  , current investments, existing cash balances and available credit facilities. Depending upon market conditions and strategic considerations, we may choose to purchase or refinance some maturing debt in the capital markets.

We paid dividends of $41 and $38 to common stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Discontinued Operations  

Net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations   was $826 and $569 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which $834 and $578, respectively, related to the operating activities at Batu Hijau and $8 and $9, respectively, related to payments on the Holt property royalty paid out of cash and cash equivalents.  

Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations   was $41 and $52 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and related entirely to   Additions to property, plant and mine development   at our Batu Hijau operations.  

Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations   was $319 and $164 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repaid $330 extinguishing the PTNNT revolving credit facility. This was partially offset by decreases in restricted cash at Batu Hijau of $11. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we repaid $105 to reduce the PTNNT revolving credit facility and increased our restricted cash balance at Batu Hijau by $59. 

For additional information regarding Batu Hijau, which is classified as held for sale, see Note 3 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have the following off-balance sheet arrangements: operating leases (as discussed in Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 17, 2016 on Form 10-K) and $2,168 of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees (see Note 25 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). At September 30, 2016,  $80 of the $3,000 corporate revolving credit facility was used to secure the issuance of letters of credit, primarily supporting reclamation obligations.  

We also have sales agreements or commitments to sell copper and gold concentrates at market prices as follows (in thousands of tonnes):

On June 30, 2016 we announced the anticipated sale of Batu Hijau. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     

Other Liquidity Matters  

At September 30, 2016, the Company had $2,099 in   Cash and cash equivalents,   of which $1,025 was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in U.S. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies

readily convertible to U.S. dollars. At September 30, 2016,  $347 of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents was attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily related to our Peruvian and Surinamese operations which is being held to fund those operations and development projects. At September 30, 2016,  $941 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($613 attributable to Newmont) was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. The repatriation of this cash and the applicable withholding taxes would generate foreign tax credits in the U.S. As a result, we expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with the withholding taxes.  

We believe that our liquidity and capital resources from U.S. operations and flow-through foreign subsidiaries are adequate to fund our U.S. operations and corporate activities.  

Environmental    

Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $1,349 and $1,300, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing mineral properties.  

Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on when the spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine. 

Accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. As mining operations progress over their mine life, we are able to more accurately predict the estimated future reclamation costs. Any such changes in future costs, the timing of reclamation activities, or scope could materially impact the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation work required.  

In early 2015, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment ( MINAM ), issued proposed water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria would modify the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In December 2015, MINAM issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards and the Company has one year to submit a modification to the previously approved Environmental Impact Assessment which is due February 15, 2017. A total of up to four years are allowed for permitting, detailed engineering, and construction of water treatment facilities required for compliance with the new water quality standards. Yanacocha is currently assessing treatment options in connection with the new water quality standards, which are expected to result in increased costs. If Yanacocha is unsuccessful in designing, constructing and implementing effective treatment options in the next four years, it could result in potential fines and penalties relating to potential intermittent non-compliant exceedances. 

We are also performing a comprehensive study of the current Yanacocha reclamation plan to update closure scope, timing and cost estimates while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. The Yanacocha closure study continued to progress the development of a revised reclamation plan during the third quarter of 2016 and is currently undergoing significant review and revision. As of September 30, 2016, the study team continued to evaluate and revise the assumptions and estimated costs of the potential changes to the closure plan with a focus on optimizing the approach to water treatment, earthworks, demolition and related support activities. We continue to engage with communities and regulators in Peru to gather stakeholder feedback as the revised closure plan is developed and to ensure all regulatory requirements are met.  In conjunction with our annual update process for all asset retirement obligations, we expect to record an adjustment to the Yanacocha reclamation liability in the fourth quarter of 2016 based on the planned progress of the closure study. The revised reclamation plan, once approved by management, is expected to result in an increase in the reclamation obligation recorded at Yanacocha and this increase could be material.  Additionally, increases in the future reclamation costs at Yanacocha could result in a significant impact to   Income (loss) from

continuing operations   from a potential impairment of the Yanacocha long-lived assets based on the current mine plans, in addition to an increase in all-in sustaining costs. 

For a complete discussion of the factors that influence our reclamation obligations and the associated risks, refer to Managements  Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading  Critical Accounting Policies  and refer to Risk Factors under the heading  Mine closure and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made  for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed February 17, 2016 on Form 10-K. 

In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $300 and $318 were accrued for such obligations at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We spent $21 and $33 during the nine months ended 2016 and 2015, respectively, for environmental obligations related to the former, primarily historic, mining activities and have classified $34 as a current liability at September 30, 2016.   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, capital expenditures were approximately $60 and $77, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures    

Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, we present the Non-GAAP financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization 

Management uses Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and EBITDA adjusted for non-core or   certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period   ( Adjusted EBITDA ) as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company s operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Management s determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.   Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders   is reconciled to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows: 

(1) 

Loss (income) from discontinued operations relates to (i) adjustments in our Holt property royalty, presented net of tax expense (benefit) of $(9), $7, $(32) and $15, respectively, (ii) the operations of Batu Hijau, presented net of tax expense (benefit) of $90, $90, $258 and $194, respectively, and (iii) the loss on classification as held for sale, which has been recorded on an attributable basis. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, see Note 3 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Adjusted net income (loss)    

Management uses Adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income (loss) allows investors and analysts to understand the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the production and sale of minerals, by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. The net income (loss) adjustments are generally presented net of tax at the Company s statutory effective tax rate of 35% and net of our partners  noncontrolling interests when applicable. The impact of the adjustments through the Company s valuation allowance is included in Tax adjustments.     The Tax adjustment also includes items such as foreign tax credits, alternative minimum tax credits, capital losses and disallowed foreign losses. Management s determination of the components of Adjusted net income (loss) are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts.   Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders   is reconciled to Adjusted net income (loss) as follows:

Loss (gain) on asset and investment sales, included in   Other income, net  , primarily represents the sale of our holdings in Regis Resources Ltd. in the first quarter of 2016, income recorded in the third quarter of 2016 associated with contingent consideration from the sale of certain properties in our North America segment during 2015, land sales of Hemlo mineral rights in Canada and the Relief Canyon mine in Nevada during the first quarter of 2015 and a gain related to the sale of our holdings in EGR in the third quarter of 2015. Amounts are presented net of tax expense (benefit) of $1, $30, $1 and $46, respectively.

Tax adjustments include movements in tax valuation allowance and tax adjustments not related to core operations. Second quarter and year to date tax adjustments were primarily the result of a tax restructuring and a loss carryback, both of which resulted in an increase in the Company s valuation allowance on credits.     

Free Cash Flow 

Management uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is   Net cash provided by operating activities   less   Net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations   less   Additions to property, plant and mine development   as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company s calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. 

The presentation of non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company s performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company s definition of Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to   Net cash provided by operating activities  , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding   Net cash used in investing activities   and   Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities  .

Net cash used in investing activities   includes   Additions to property, plant and mine development  , which is included in the Company s computation of Free Cash Flow.

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound  

Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales from continuing operations of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.  

The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures from continuing operations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Newmont has worked to develop a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as Costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.  

Current GAAP-measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain gold production. Therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and in the investor s visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.  

All-in sustaining cost ( AISC ) amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a

reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development capital activities based upon each company s internal policies.  

The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:  

Costs Applicable to Sales   - Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current gold production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from   Costs applicable to sales   ( CAS ), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes   Depreciation and amortization   and   Reclamation and remediation  , which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of copper at our Phoenix and Boddington mines. The copper CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines is based upon the relative sales value of copper and gold produced during the period. 

Reclamation Costs   - Includes accretion expense related to Asset Retirement Obligation ( ARO ) and the amortization of the related Asset Retirement Cost ( ARC ) for the Company s operating properties. Accretion related to the ARO and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current gold production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines. 

Advanced Projects and Exploration   - Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to increase or enhance current gold production and gold exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves. As this relates to sustaining our gold production, and is considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the   Advanced projects, research and development   and   Exploration   amounts presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount attributable to the production of copper at our Phoenix and Boddington mines. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines. 

General and Administrative   - Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current gold production, but rather related to supporting our corporate structure and fulfilling our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis. 

Other expense, net   - Includes administrative costs to support current gold production. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from   Other expense, net  , such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current gold operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to   Other expense, net   is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to   Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders   as disclosed in the Company s non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines. 

Treatment and Refining Costs   - Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of   Sales  . 

Sustaining Capital   - We determined sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current gold production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations, or related to   

85 

Table of Contents  

projects at existing operations where these projects will enhance gold production or reserves, are considered development. We determined the classification of sustaining and development capital projects based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital costs are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company s current gold operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.

ITEM 3.       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES   ABOUT MARKET RISK   (dollars in millions, except per ounce and per pound amounts).  

Metal Prices  

Changes in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the U.S. dollar; inflation, deflation, or other general price instability; and global mine production levels. Changes in the market price of copper also affect our profitability and cash flow. Copper is traded on established international exchanges and copper prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates.  

Decreases in the market price of gold and copper can also significantly affect the value of our product inventory, stockpiles and ore on leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the net realizable value ( NRV ). NRV represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of our product inventory, stockpiles and ore on leach pads include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile, leach pad and product inventory adjustments for each mine site reporting unit at September 30, 2016  included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, a short-term and long-term gold price of $1,335 and $1,300 per ounce, respectively, a short-term and long-term copper price of $2.17 and $3.00 per pound, respectively, and an Australian to U.S. dollar long-term exchange rate of $0.80.  

91 

Table of Contents  

The NRV measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.  

Hedging  

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and copper prices by selling our production at spot market prices. Consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. We have and will continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs, interest rates and foreign currencies using the derivative market.  

By using derivatives, we are affected by credit risk, market risk and market liquidity risk. Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying commodity prices, interest rates or currency exchange rates and that this in turn affects our financial condition. We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or be subject to any margin calls on our derivatives. Our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. Market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. Under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breaches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. We further mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time.  

Cash Flow Hedges  

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk  

We had the following foreign currency derivative contracts in Asia Pacific outstanding at September 30, 2016:   

The fair value of the A$ foreign currency operating derivative contracts was a net liability position of $25 at September 30, 2016 and $60 at December 31, 2015.   

92 

Table of Contents  

Diesel Price Risk  

We had the following diesel derivative contracts in North America outstanding at September 30, 2016:   

The fair value of the Diesel derivative contracts was a net liability position of $8 at September 30, 2016 and $32 at December 31, 2015. 

Commodity Price Risk  

Our provisional gold and copper sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the gold and copper concentrates at the prevailing indices  prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.  

At September 30, 2016, Newmont had gold sales of 130,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,324 per ounce, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $25 change in the price for provisionally priced gold sales would have an approximate $2 effect on our   Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders  . The London P.M. closing settlement price at September 30, 2016 for gold was $1,323 per ounce.  

At September 30, 2016, Newmont had copper sales of 26 million pounds priced at an average of $2.20 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. Each $0.10 change in the price for provisionally priced copper sales would have an approximate $1 effect on our   Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders  . The LME closing settlement price at September 30, 2016 for copper was $2.19 per pound.  

ITEM 4.       CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.    

During the fiscal period covered by this report, the Company s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

During the third quarter of 2015, the Company began outsourcing certain of its information technology and transactional business processes to a third-party provider. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has transitioned certain procure-to-pay, payroll and transactional accounting processes in its Corporate office and its Asia Pacific, North America, South America and Africa regions as well as certain global information technology processes, including infrastructure and application support and the service desk, to the third-party provider. The Company plans to continue transitioning business processes to the third-party provider through the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company has taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. 

There were no other changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

ITEM 4.       MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.    

At Newmont, safety is a core value and we strive for superior performance. Our health and safety management system, which includes detailed standards and procedures for safe production, addresses topics such as employee training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. In addition to strong leadership and involvement from all levels of the organization, these programs and procedures form the cornerstone of safety at Newmont, ensuring that employees are provided a safe and healthy environment and are intended to reduce workplace accidents, incidents and losses, comply with all mining-related regulations and provide support for both regulators and the industry to improve mine safety.  

In addition, we have established our  Rapid Response  process to mitigate and prevent the escalation of adverse consequences if existing risk management controls fail, particularly if an incident may have the potential to seriously impact the safety of employees, the community or the environment. This process provides appropriate support to an affected site to complement their technical response to an incident, so as to reduce the impact by considering the environmental, strategic, legal, financial and public image aspects of the incident, to ensure communications are being carried out in accordance with legal and ethical requirements and to identify actions in addition to those addressing the immediate hazards.  

The operation of our U.S. based mines is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in recent years.

Exhibit 95  

Mine Safety Disclosure  

The following disclosures are provided pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Act ) and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which require certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ). The disclosures reflect our U.S. mining operations only as the requirements of the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K do not apply to our mines operated outside the United States.  

Mine Safety Information.   Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the U.S. mining operator (e.g. our subsidiary, Newmont USA Limited) must abate the alleged violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine as well as by the MSHA inspector(s) assigned.  

The below table reflects citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the quarter ended September  30, 2016. The proposed assessments for the quarter ended September  30, 2016 were taken from the MSHA data retrieval system as of October 4, 2016.   

Additional information about the Act and MSHA references used in the table follows.  

Section 104(a) S S Citations  : Citations received from MSHA under section 104(a) of the Mine Act for violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard.      

Section 104(b) Orders  : Orders issued by MSHA under section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represents a failure to abate a citation under section 104(a) within the period of time prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated.      

Section 104(d) S S Citations and Orders  : Citations and orders issued by MSHA under section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory, significant and substantial health or safety standards.      

Section 110(b)(2) Violations  : Flagrant violations issued by MSHA under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act.      

Section 107(a) Orders  : Orders issued by MSHA under section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an  imminent danger  (as defined by MSHA) existed.      

(1) 

The definition of a mine under section 3 of the Mine Act includes the mine, as well as other items used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, the work of extracting minerals, such as land, structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools, and minerals preparation facilities. Unless otherwise indicated, any of these other items associated with a single mine have been aggregated in the totals for that mine. MSHA assigns an identification number to each mine and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities such as preparation facilities. We are providing the information in the table by mine rather than MSHA identification number because that is how we manage and operate our mining business and we believe this presentation will be more useful to investors than providing information based on MSHA identification numbers.      

(3) 

Represents the total dollar value of the proposed assessment from MSHA under the Mine Act pursuant to the citations and or orders preceding such dollar value in the corresponding row. No proposed assessments of the orders or citations listed above had yet been posted to the MSHA data retrieval system or made available to the Company by MSHA as of October 4, 2016.   Proposed assessments aggregate to $47,147 for the quarter, with proposed assessments at Cripple Creek   Victor of $9,294, at Exodus not yet assessed, at Genesis of $5,196 and at Leeville of $32,657.      

Pattern or Potential Pattern of Violations  . During the quarter ended September  30, 2016, none of the mines operated by us received written notice from MSHA of (a) a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act or (b) the potential to have such a pattern.  

Pending Legal Actions  . The following table reflects pending legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the  Commission ), an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act, as of September  30, 2016, together with the number of legal actions instituted and the number of legal actions resolved as of September  30, 2016.

The foregoing list includes legal actions which were initiated prior to the current reporting period and which do not necessarily relate to citations, orders or proposed assessments issued by MSHA during the quarter ended September  30, 2016. The number of legal actions noted above are reported on a per docket basis.     

Legal actions pending before the Commission may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from MSHA or complaints of discrimination by miners under section 105 of the Mine Act. The following is a brief description of the types of legal actions that may be brought before the Commission.  

Contests of Citations and Orders:   A contest proceeding may be filed with the Commission by operators, miners or miners  representatives to challenge the issuance of a citation or order issued by MSHA.      

Contests of Proposed Penalties (Petitions for Assessment of Penalties)  : A contest of a proposed penalty is an administrative proceeding before the Commission challenging a civil penalty that MSHA has proposed for the alleged violation contained in a citation or order. The validity of the citation may also be challenged in this proceeding as well.      

Complaints for Compensation:   A complaint for compensation may be filed with the Commission by miners entitled to compensation when a mine is closed by certain withdrawal orders issued by MSHA. The purpose of the proceeding is to determine the amount of compensation, if any, due miners idled by the orders.      

Complaints of Discharge, Discrimination or Interference  : A discrimination proceeding is a case that involves a miner s allegation that he or she has suffered a wrong by the operator because he or she engaged in some type of activity protected under the Mine Act, such as making a safety complaint.      

Applications for Temporary Relief  : An application for temporary relief from any modification or termination of any order or from any order issued under section 104 of the Mine Act.      

Appeals of Judges  Decisions or Orders to the Commission  : A filing with the Commission of a petition for discretionary review of a Judge s decision or order by a person who has been adversely affected or aggrieved by such decision or order.      

The following table reflects the types of legal actions pending before the Commission as of September  30, 2016.
