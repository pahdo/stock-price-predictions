This
quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.
In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may ,  should ,  expects ,
 plans ,  anticipates ,  believes ,  estimates ,  predicts ,  potential 
or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.  

These
statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our
industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. While these forward-looking
statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the
direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections,
assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required
by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements
to conform these statements to actual results.  

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial statements. The following
discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear

NOTE
1   Interim financial statement disclosure   

The
consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Liberty Star Uranium   Metals Corp. (the  Company ,
 we ,  our ) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and should be read in conjunction with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
January 31, 2016 as filed with the SEC under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted, as permitted by the SEC, although we believe
the disclosures which are made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The consolidated financial statements
reflect, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position at
October 31, 2016 and the results of our operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

Interim
results are subject to significant seasonal variations and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended
October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  

Certain
amounts in the prior-year financial statements have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform with the presentation
in the current-year financial statements.  

NOTE
2  Going concern   

The
Company has incurred losses from operations, and requires additional funds for further exploratory activity and to maintain its
claims prior to attaining a revenue generating status. There are no assurances that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists
on any of our properties. In addition, the Company may not find sufficient ore reserves to be commercially mined. As such, there
is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

Management
is working to secure additional funds through the exercise of stock warrants already outstanding, equity financings, debt financings
or joint venture agreements. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of these uncertainties.  

NOTE
3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Fair
Value    

ASC
820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. It defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received
for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
that are not active; and model-driven valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Valuations may be obtained from, or corroborated by, third-party pricing services.  

Level
3: Unobservable inputs to measure fair value of assets and liabilities for which there is little, if any market activity at the
measurement date, using reasonable inputs and assumptions based upon the best information at the time, to the extent that inputs
are available without undue cost and effort.  

As
of October 31, 2016, the significant inputs to the Company s derivative liability calculation were Level 3 inputs.  

The
following schedule summarizes the valuation of financial instruments at fair value in the balance sheets as of October 31, 2016
and January 31, 2016:

Our
financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, convertible notes payable,
notes payable, and warrant liability. It is management s opinion that we are not exposed to significant interest, currency
or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. With the exception of the warrant liability, the fair value of these
financial instruments approximates their carrying values based on their short maturities or for long-term debt based on borrowing
rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities. Gains and losses recognized on changes in estimated
fair value of the derivative liability are reported in other income (expense) as gain (loss) on change in fair value.  

NOTE

NOTE
7   Derivative Liabilities   

The
embedded conversion feature in the convertible debt instruments that the Company issued beginning in August 2013 (See Note 8),
and became convertible beginning in February 2014, qualified it as a derivative instrument since the number of shares issuable
under the note is indeterminate based on guidance in FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. This convertible note tainted all
other equity linked instruments including outstanding warrants and fixed rate convertible debt on the date that the instrument
became convertible.  

The
valuation of the derivative liability of the warrants was determined through the use of a Monte Carlo options model that values
the liability of the warrants based on a risk-neutral valuation where the price of the option is its discounted expected value.
The technique applied generates a large number of possible (but random) price paths for the underlying common stock via simulation,
and then calculates the associated exercise value (i.e.  payoff ) of the option for each path. These payoffs are then
averaged and discounted to a current valuation date resulting in the fair value of the option.  

The
valuation of the derivative liability attached to the convertible debt was arrived at through the use of a Monte Carlo model that
values the derivative liability within the notes. The technique applied generates a large number of possible (but random) price
paths for the underlying (or underlyings) via simulation, and then calculates the associated payment value (cash, stock, or warrants)
of the derivative features. The price of the underlying common stock is modeled such that it follows a geometric Brownian motion
with constant drift, and elastic volatility (increasing as stock price decreases). The stock price is determined by a random sampling
from a normal distribution. Since the underlying random process is the same, for enough price paths, the value of the derivative
is derived from path dependent scenarios and outcomes. The features in the notes that were analyzed and incorporated into the
model included the conversion features with the reset provisions, the call/redemption/prepayment options, and the default provisions.
Based on these features, there are six primary events that can occur; payments are made in cash; payments are made with stock;
the note holder converts upon receiving a redemption notice; the note holder converts the note; the issuer redeems the note; or
the Company defaults on the note. The model simulates the underlying economic factors that influenced which of these events would
occur, when they were likely to occur, and the specific terms that would be in effect at the time (i.e. stock price, conversion
price, etc.). Probabilities were assigned to each variable such as redemption likelihood, default likelihood, and timing and pricing
of reset events over the remaining term of the notes based on management projections. This led to a cash flow simulation over
the life of the note. A discounted cash flow for each simulation was completed, and it was compared to the discounted cash flow
of the note without the embedded features, thus determining a value for the derivative liability.  

Key
inputs and assumptions used to value the convertible notes and warrants upon issuance or tainting and also as of October 31, 2016:  

The
    stock projections are based on the historical volatilities for each date. These ranged in the 170% - 176% range. The stock
    price projection was modeled such that it follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and a constant volatility,
    starting with the market stock price at each valuation date;   

An
    event of default would not occur during the remaining term of the note;   

Conversion
    of the notes to stock would be completed monthly after any holding period and would be limited based on: 5% of the last 6
    months average trading volume and the ownership limit identified in the contract assuming the underlying number of common
    shares increases at 1% per month. The effective discount was determined based on the historical trading history of the Company
    based on the specific pricing mechanism in each note;   

The
    Company would not have funds available to redeem the notes during the remaining term of the convertible notes;   

Discount
    rates were based on risk free rates in effect based on the remaining term and date of each valuation and instrument.   

The
    holder would exercise the warrant at maturity if the stock price was above the exercise price;   

The
    Holder would exercise the warrant after any holding period prior to maturity at target prices starting at 2 times the exercise
    price for the Warrants or higher subject to monthly limits of: 5% of the last 6 months average trading volume increasing by
    1% per month and the ownership limit identified in the contract assuming the underlying number of common shares increases
    at 1% per month.   

Using the results from the model, the Company
recorded a derivative liability of $764,826 for outstanding warrants and a derivative liability of $246,143 for the fair
value of the convertible feature included in the Company s convertible debt instruments for the nine months ended October
31, 2016. The derivative liability recorded for the convertible feature created a debt discount of $225,969 which was amortized
over the remaining term of the note using the effective interest rate method, or charged to interest expense upon conversion of
the underlying debt instrument. Interest expense related to the amortization of this debt discount for the three months ended
October 31, 2016, was $557. Additionally, $61,043 of debt discount was charged to interest expense as a result of the conversion
of a portion of the underlying debt instrument.  The remaining unamortized debt discount related to the derivative liability
was $0 as of October 31, 2016. The Company recorded the change in the fair value of the derivative liability as a loss of $184,793

Liberty
Star Uranium   Metals Corp. was formerly Liberty Star Gold Corp. and formerly Titanium Intelligence, Inc. ( Titanium ).
Titanium was incorporated on August 20, 2001 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On February 5, 2004 we commenced operations
in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties business. Big Chunk Corp. ( Big Chunk ) is our wholly owned
subsidiary and was incorporated on December 14, 2003 in the State of Alaska. Big Chunk is engaged in the acquisition and exploration
of mineral properties business in the State of Alaska. Redwall Drilling Inc. ( Redwall ) was our wholly owned subsidiary
and was incorporated on August 31, 2007 in the State of Arizona. Redwall performed drilling services on our mineral properties.
Redwall ceased drilling activities in July 2008 and was dissolved on March 30, 2010. In April 2007, we changed our name to Liberty
Star Uranium   Metals Corp ( Liberty Star ) to reflect our current general exploration for base and precious metals.
We are in the exploration phase of operations and have not generated any revenues from operations.  

In
October 2014, we formed our wholly owned subsidiary, Hay Mountain Super Project LLC ( HMSP LLC ), to serve as the
primary holding company for development of the potential ore bodies encompassed in the Hay Mountain area of interest in Arizona.  

Our
Current Business   

We
are engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in the States of Arizona and Alaska and Southwest USA.. Claims
in the State of Alaska have been held in the name of Big Chunk. Claims in the State of Arizona are held in the name of Liberty
Star. We use the term  Super Project  to indicate a project in which numerous mineral targets have been identified,
any one or more of which could potentially contain commercially viable quantities of minerals. Our significant projects are described
below.  

North
Pipes Super Project ( North Pipes  and  NPSP ):  The NPSP is located in Northern Arizona on the Arizona
Strip. We plan to ascertain whether the NPSP claims possess commercially viable deposits of uranium and associated co-product
metals. We have not identified any ore reserves to date.  

Big
Chunk Super Project:  The Big Chunk Super Project located in the Iliamna region of Southwestern Alaska: After much caution
and thought, we have decided to no longer put any funds into Big Chunk due to the current decision making of the Environmental
Protection Agency . If the situation becomes clarified next year, we believe we will have the opportunity to reacquire strategic
claims within the area.  

Tombstone
Super Project ( Tombstone ) (formerly referred to as Tombstone Porphyry Precious Metals Project):  Tombstone is
located in Cochise County, Arizona and covers the Tombstone caldera and its environs. Within the Tombstone caldera is the Hay
Mountain target where we are concentrating our work at this time. We plan to ascertain whether the Tombstone, Hay Mountain claims
possess commercially viable deposits of copper, molybdenum, gold, silver, lead, zinc, manganese and other metals including Rare
Earth Elements (REE s). We have not identified any ore reserves to date.  

East
Silver Bell Porphyry Copper Project ( East Silver Bell ):  East Silver Bell is located northwest of Tucson, Arizona.
We plan to ascertain whether the East Silver Bell claims possess commercially viable deposits of copper. We have not identified
any ore reserves to date.  

Title
to mineral claims involves certain inherent risks due to difficulties in determining the validity of certain claims, as well as
potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveyancing history characteristic of many mineral properties. We
have investigated title to all the Company s mineral properties and, to the best of its knowledge, title to all properties
retained are in good standing.  

The
mineral resource business generally consists of three stages: exploration, development and production. Mineral resource companies
that are in the exploration stage have not yet found mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities, and are engaged
in exploring land in an effort to discover them. Mineral resource companies that have located a mineral resource in commercially
exploitable quantities and are preparing to extract that resource are in the development stage, while those engaged in the extraction
of a known mineral resource are in the production stage. We have not found any mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities.  

There
is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties, and further exploration is required
before we can evaluate whether any exist and, if so, whether it would be economically feasible to develop or exploit those resources.
Even if we complete our current exploration program and we are successful in identifying a mineral deposit, we would be required
to spend substantial funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we could know whether that mineral deposit will
constitute a commercially viable mineral deposit, known as an  ore reserve.   

To
date, we have not generated any revenues. Our ability to pursue our business plan and generate revenues is subject to our ability
to obtain additional financing, and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to do so.  

Results

Changes in Financial Condition for the Nine Month Period Ended October 31, 2016   

We had cash and cash equivalents in the amount
of $9,909 as of October 31, 2016 compared to $536 as of January 31, 2016. We had negative working capital of $991,116 as
of October 31, 2016 compared to $943,763 as of January 31, 2016. We used $385,794 net cash in operating activities during the
nine months ended October 31, 2016 which was utilized for working capital. We also utilized our cash funds to continue exploration
activities at our Hay Mountain mineral lands by working on geochemical interpretation of the soil, rock chip and vegetation sampling
and ztem (aeormagnetics and aero electromagnetics). We purchased no new equipment during the nine months ended October 31, 2016.
We have been raising capital by issuing convertible promissory notes and selling equity by way of private placements and the Investment
Agreement with Tangiers Investment Group, LLC. We intend to continue to raise capital from such sources. In addition to seeking
sources of funding through the sale of equity, we may seek to enter into joint venture agreements, or other types of agreements
with other companies to finance our projects for the long term. In addition, we may choose to sell a portion of our assets to
finance our projects. Should our properties prove to be commercially viable, we may be in a position to seek debt financing to
help build infrastructure, and eventually we may obtain revenues from commercial mining of our properties.

rental fees paid by the Company. During the three and nine months ended October 31, 2016, we had an decrease of approximately
$25,723 and $16,982, respectively, in public relations costs compared to the three and nine months ended October 31, 2015, due

had an increase in professional services of approximately $17,296 during the nine months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to
the nine months ended October 31, 2015, due primarily to increased accounting and reporting costs. We incurred a non-cash gain
on the change in fair value of our derivative liabilities of $17,408 and a loss of $13,233, respectively, during the three and
nine months ended October 31, 2016, as compared to a loss of $13,233 and a gain of $70,766 during the three and nine months ended

instruments including outstanding warrants and fixed rate convertible debt at fair value during the three and nine months ended
October 2016 and 2015. We recognized a gain of $72,308 during the nine months ended October 31, 2015 as a result of convertible

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements of Liberty Star have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements included in Item 8 in our Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2016. The critical accounting policies adopted by
our company are as follows:  

Going
Concern   

Since
we have not generated any revenue, we have negative cash flows from operations and negative working capital, we have included
a reference to the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in connection with our condensed consolidated
financial statements as of October 31, 2016. Our total stockholders  deficit at October 31, 2016 was $1,013,711.  

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that adequate sources of financing
will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized, and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business.
Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of
assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Mineral
claims   

We
account for costs incurred to acquire, maintain and explore mineral properties as charged to expense in the period incurred until
the time that a proven mineral resource is established at which point development of the mineral property would be capitalized.
Currently, we do not have any proven mineral resources on any of our mineral properties.  

Convertible
promissory notes   

We
reviewed the convertible promissory notes and the related subscription agreements to determine the appropriate reporting within
the condensed consolidated financial statements. We report convertible promissory notes as liabilities at their carrying value
less unamortized discounts in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. We record conversion options and detachable
common stock purchase warrants and report them as derivative liabilities at fair value at each reporting period when required
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. No gain or loss is reported when the notes are converted into shares of
our common stock in accordance with the note s terms.  

Common
stock purchase warrants   

We
report common stock purchase warrants as equity unless a condition exists which requires reporting as a derivative liability at
fair market value. For common stock purchase warrants reported as a derivative liability, as well as new and modified warrants
reported as equity, we utilize a Monte Carlo options model in order to determine fair value.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   

Not
applicable.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures at October 31, 2016, which is the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this report. This
evaluation was carried out by Mr. James Briscoe, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on this
evaluation, Mr. Briscoe has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as at the end of the period covered
by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

During
the quarter ended October 31, 2016 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
