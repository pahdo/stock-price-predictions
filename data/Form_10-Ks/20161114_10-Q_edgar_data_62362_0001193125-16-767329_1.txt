     MARINE PETROLEUM TRUST AND SUBSIDIARY   
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  September 30, 2016   
  (Unaudited)       

Note 1.  
  Accounting Policies       The financial statements herein include the financial statements of
Marine Petroleum Trust (the  Trust ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Marine Petroleum Corporation ( MPC,  and collectively with the Trust,  Marine ). The financial statements are condensed and consolidated and should
be read in conjunction with Marine s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The financial statements included herein are unaudited, but in the opinion of Southwest Bank (the  Trustee ), the Trustee of
the Trust, they include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods presented. Operating results for the interim periods reported herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.      

Note 2.  
  Basis of Accounting       The financial statements of Marine are prepared on the modified
cash basis method and are not intended to present Marine s financial position and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ). Under the modified cash basis method
the financial statements of Marine differ from financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP because of the following:      

Royalty income is recognized in the month when received by Marine rather than in the month of production.        

Marine s expenses (including accounting, legal, other professional fees, trustees  fees and out-of-pocket expenses) are recorded on an actual paid basis in the month paid rather than in the month
incurred. Reserves for liabilities that are contingent or uncertain in amount may also be established if considered necessary, which would not be recorded under GAAP.    

At the time the Trust was established, no determinable market value was available for the assets transferred to the Trust; consequently, nominal values were assigned. Accordingly, no allowance for depletion has been
included. All income from oil and natural gas royalties relate to proved developed oil and natural gas reserves.      The
modified cash basis method of accounting corresponds to the accounting principles permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ), as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,  Financial
Statements of Royalty Trusts .      

Note 3.  
  Distributable Income       The Trust s Indenture (the  Indenture ) provides
that the Trustee is to distribute all cash in the Trust, less an amount reserved for payment of accrued liabilities and estimated future expenses, to unitholders of record on the 28 th  day of
March, June, September and December of each year. Total estimated reserve for future expenses deducted from calculated distributable income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $101,500. If the 28 th  day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the payments are to be made on the immediately succeeding business day.  
 As stated under  Note 1. Accounting Policies  above, the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are the
condensed and consolidated financial statements of the Trust and MPC. However, distributable income is paid from the account balances of the Trust. Distributable income is comprised of (i) royalties from offshore Texas leases owned directly by
the Trust, (ii) 98% of the royalties received from offshore Louisiana leases owned by MPC, which are retained by and delivered to the Trust on a quarterly basis, (iii) cash distributions from the Trust s interest in Tidelands Royalty
Trust  B  ( Tidelands ), a separate publicly traded royalty trust, (iv) dividends paid by MPC, less (v) administrative expenses incurred by the Trust. Distributions fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due
to changes in oil and natural gas prices and production quantities.

Note 4.  
  Investment in Affiliate   Tidelands Royalty Trust  B        At September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Trust owned 32.6% of the outstanding units of beneficial interest in Tidelands.    The following summary financial
statements have been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Tidelands:     TIDELANDS CONDENSED
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF DISTRIBUTABLE INCOME       
   Tidelands is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ), and has filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Consolidated statements of distributable income data concerning Tidelands has been presented through September 30, 2016, the latest
period for which such information is publicly available in Tidelands  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Reference should be made to Tidelands  public filings for current information concerning
Tidelands and its financial position and results of operations.       Item 2.  Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Organization   
 Marine Petroleum Trust (the  Trust ) is a royalty trust that was created in 1956 under the laws of the State of Texas. Southwest
Bank, an independent state bank chartered under the laws of the State of Texas and headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, serves as corporate trustee (the  Trustee ). The Trust s Indenture (the  Indenture ) provides that
the term of the Trust will expire on June 1, 2021, unless extended by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of beneficial interest. The Trust is not permitted to engage in any business activity because it was organized
for the sole purpose of providing an efficient, orderly and practical means for the administration and liquidation of rights to payments from certain oil and natural gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico, pursuant to license agreements and amendments
between the Trust s predecessors and Gulf Oil Corporation ( Gulf ). As a result of various transactions that have occurred since 1956, these interests now are held by Chevron Corporation ( Chevron ) and its assignees. The
Trust holds title to interests in properties that are situated offshore of Texas.    The Trust s wholly owned subsidiary, Marine
Petroleum Corporation ( MPC,  and collectively with the Trust,  Marine ), holds title to interests in properties that are situated offshore of Louisiana because at the time the Trust was created, trusts could not hold these
interests under Louisiana law. MPC is prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and only takes those actions that are necessary for the administration and liquidation of its properties.  
      5  

Table of Contents  

  Marine s rights are generally referred to as overriding royalty interests in the oil and
natural gas industry. An overriding royalty interest is created by an assignment by the owner of a working interest in an oil or natural gas lease. The royalty rights associated with an overriding royalty interest terminate when the underlying lease
terminates. All production and marketing functions are conducted by the working interest owners of the leases. Income from overriding royalties is paid to Marine either (i) on the basis of the selling price of oil, natural gas and other
minerals produced, saved or sold, or (ii) at the value at the wellhead as determined by industry standards, when the selling price does not reflect the value at the wellhead.  
 The Trustee assumes that some units of beneficial interest are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations
(and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for a customer in street name). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a widely held fixed investment trust ( WHFIT ) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Trust will provide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. The Trustee will provide the required
information and the contact information for the Trustee is below:    Southwest Bank  
 2911 Turtle Creek Blvd., Suite 850  
 Dallas, Texas 75219    Telephone
number: (855) 588-7839    Each unitholder should consult its own tax advisor for compliance with U.S. federal income tax laws and
regulations.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 As stated in the Indenture, there is no requirement for capital due to the limited purpose of the Trust. The Trust s only obligation is to
distribute the distributable income that is actually collected to unitholders. As an administrator of oil and natural gas royalty interests, the Trust collects royalties monthly, pays administrative expenses and disburses all net royalties that are
collected to its unitholders each quarter, subject to the availability of distributable income on the distribution date after the payment of expenses.  
 The Indenture (and MPC s charter and by-laws) expressly prohibits the operation of any kind of trade or business. The Trust s oil
and natural gas properties are depleting assets that are not being replaced due to the prohibition against investments. These restrictions, along with other factors, allow the Trust to be treated as a grantor trust. As a grantor trust, all income
and deductions for state and U.S. federal income tax purposes generally flow through to each individual unitholder. The State of Texas imposes a franchise tax, but the Trust does not believe that it is subject to the franchise tax because at least
90% of its income is from passive sources. Please see Marine s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 for further information. MPC is a taxable entity that pays state and U.S. federal income taxes and state
franchise taxes. However, MPC s income specifically excludes 98% of the oil and natural gas royalties collected by MPC, which are retained by and delivered to the Trust because of the Trust s net profits interest. 
  The Leases     Marine relies on public
records for information regarding drilling and workover operations. The public records available up to the date of this report indicate that there were no new well completions made during the three months ended September 30, 2016 on leases in which
Marine has an interest. As of November 1, 2016, public records also indicated that there were no wells in the process of being drilled or recompleted on other leases in which Marine has an interest.  
 Marine holds an overriding royalty interest that is equal to three-fourths of one percent of the working interest and is calculated on the
value at the well of any oil, natural gas or other minerals produced and sold from 55 leases covering 199,868 gross acres located in the Gulf of Mexico. Marine s overriding royalty interest applies only
 
      6  

Table of Contents  

to existing leases and does not apply to any new leases that Chevron may acquire. The Trust also owns a 32.6% interest in Tidelands Royalty Trust  B  ( Tidelands ). Tidelands
has an overriding royalty interest in four oil and natural gas leases covering 17,188 gross acres in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of this ownership, the Trust receives periodic distributions from Tidelands.  
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 In accordance with the Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,  Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts , Marine uses the modified cash basis
method of accounting. Under this accounting method, royalty income is recorded when received, and distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared by the Trustee of the Trust. Expenses of Marine (including accounting, legal, other
professional fees, trustees  fees and out-of-pocket expenses) are recorded on an actual paid basis. Marine also reports distributable income instead of net income under the modified cash basis method of accounting. Cash reserves are
permitted to be established by the Trustee for certain contingencies that would not be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  
 Marine did not have any changes in its critical accounting policies or estimates during the three months ended September 30,
2016. Please see Marine s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 for a detailed discussion of its critical accounting policies.  
  New Accounting Pronouncements     There are
no new pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on Marine s financial statements.     General   
 Marine s royalty income is derived from the oil and natural gas production activities of third parties. Marine s royalty income
fluctuates from period to period based upon factors beyond Marine s control, including, without limitation, the number of productive wells drilled and maintained on leases that are subject to Marine s interest, the level of production over
time from such wells and the prices at which the oil and natural gas from such wells are sold.    Important aspects of Marine s
operations are conducted by third parties. Marine s royalty income is dependent on the operations of the working interest owners of the leases on which Marine has an overriding royalty interest. The oil and natural gas companies that lease
tracts subject to Marine s interests are responsible for the production and sale of oil and natural gas and the calculation of royalty payments to Marine. The only obligation of the working interest owners to Marine is to make monthly
overriding royalty payments that reflect Marine s interest in the oil and natural gas sold. Marine s distributions are processed and paid by its transfer agent, American Stock Transfer   Trust Company, LLC.  
 The volume of oil and natural gas produced and the selling prices of such oil and natural gas are the primary factors in calculating
overriding royalty payments. Production is affected by the natural production decline of the producing wells, the number of new wells drilled and the number of existing wells that are re-worked and placed back in production on the leases. Production
from existing wells is anticipated to decrease in the future due to normal well depletion. The operators do not provide Marine with information regarding future drilling or re-working operations that could impact the oil and natural gas production
from the leases for which Marine has an overriding royalty interest.

   Summary of Operating Results   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, excluding the Trust s interest in Tidelands, the Trust realized approximately 93% of its
royalty income from the sale of oil and approximately 7% of its royalty income from the sale of natural gas. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, excluding the Trust s interest in Tidelands, the Trust realized approximately 84% of
its royalty income from the sale of oil and approximately 16% of its royalty income from the sale of natural gas. Royalty income includes royalties from oil and natural gas received from producers. The change in ratio of oil and natural gas was due
to significantly lower natural gas production in the current quarter as compared to the decrease in oil production.    Distributable income
per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $0.09 as compared to $0.13 for the comparable period in 2015. Distributions per unit amounted to $0.04 per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease from
distributions of $0.11 per unit for the comparable period in 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the difference between distributable income per unit and distributions per unit resulted from timing differences between the
closing of the financial statements and the determination date of the distribution amount to unitholders.    For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, excluding the Trust s interest in Tidelands, oil production decreased to 3,941 barrels (bbls) from 4,019 bbls and natural gas production decreased to 9,087 thousand cubic feet (mcf) from 16,485 mcf as compared to the
comparable period in 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, excluding the Trust s interest in Tidelands, the average price realized for oil decreased to $44.33 per bbl as compared to the price of $59.73 realized for the comparable
period in 2015 and the average price realized for natural gas decreased to $1.52 per mcf as compared to the average price of $2.74 realized for the comparable period in 2015.  
 The following table presents the net production quantities of oil and natural gas and distributable income and distributions per unit for the
last six quarters.

 Excludes the Trust s interest in Tidelands.       Results of Operations Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015     Income from oil and natural gas royalties, excluding the Trust s
interest in Tidelands, decreased to $188,546 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $285,244 realized for the comparable period in 2015. Royalties decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in
the prices of oil and natural gas and a decrease in the production of natural gas as compared to the comparable period in 2015.  
 Distributable income decreased to $171,379 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $268,300 realized for the comparable period in
2015.

  Income from oil royalties, excluding the Trust s interest in Tidelands, for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $174,705 from $240,073 realized for the comparable period in 2015. The volume of oil sold in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 3,941 bbls from 4,019 bbls realized for the comparable period
in 2015, and the average price realized for oil decreased to $44.33 per bbl for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $59.73 per bbl realized for the comparable period in 2015.  
 Income from natural gas royalties, excluding the Trust s interest in Tidelands, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased
to $13,841 (net of expenses) from $45,171 (net of expenses) for the comparable period in 2015. The volume of natural gas sold in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 9,087 mcf from 16,485 mcf realized for the comparable period in
2015, and the average price realized for natural gas decreased to $1.52 per mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.74 per mcf realized for the comparable period in 2015.  
 Income from distributions received from Tidelands for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $68 from $6,949 for the
comparable period in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the income from oil and natural gas royalties received by Tidelands, which was caused by a decrease in the production and price of oil and natural gas.  
 The following table presents the quantities of oil and natural gas sold and the average price realized for the three months ended September
30, 2016, and those realized for the comparable period in 2015, excluding the Trust s interest in Tidelands.      
   General and administrative expenses decreased to $17,313 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
$23,900 for the comparable period of 2015, primarily due to decreased professional fees and expenses.     Forward-Looking Statements   
 The statements discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding Marine s future financial performance and results, and other
statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. This report uses the words  anticipate, 
 believe,   budget,   continue,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   may,   plan,  or other similar words to identify forward-looking statements. You should read statements
that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain projections of Marine s financial condition, and/or state other  forward-looking  information. Actual results may differ from expected results
because of: reductions in price or demand for oil and natural gas, which might then lead to decreased production or impair Marine s ability to make distributions; reductions in production due to the depletion of existing wells or disruptions in
service, which may be caused by storm damage to production facilities, blowouts or other production accidents, or geological changes such as cratering of productive formations; changes in regulations; general economic conditions; actions and
policies of petroleum-producing nations; other changes in domestic and international energy markets; the resignation of the Trustee; and the expiration, termination or release of leases subject to Marine s interests. Additional risks are set
forth in Marine s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Events may occur in the future that Marine is unable to accurately predict or over which it has no control. If one or more of these
 
      9  

Table of Contents  

uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Marine does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.  
  Website     Marine makes available, free of
charge, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to such reports at its website at www.marps-marine.com. Each of these reports will be posted on this website as soon as reasonably
practicable after such report is electronically filed with, or furnished, to the SEC.       Item 3.  Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      There has been no material change from the information provided in Marine s Annual
Report on Form 10-K,  Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 
    Item 4.  Controls and Procedures    
  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
