1  )   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
  Description of Business-  CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the  Company  or  CBS Corp. ) is comprised of the following segments: Entertainment (CBS Television, comprised of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International, and CBS Television Distribution; CBS Interactive and CBS Films), Cable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks), Publishing (Simon   Schuster), Local Media (CBS Television Stations) and Radio (CBS Radio).  
    
  In connection with the Company s previously announced plans to separate its radio business, a preliminary registration statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the third quarter of 2016 for the proposed initial public offering of the common stock of CBS Radio Inc. ( CBS Radio ). In preparation for the planned separation, the Company changed the manner in which it manages its television and radio operations during the third quarter of 2016. Accordingly, the Company's previously reported operating segment, Local Broadcasting, has been separated into two operating segments, Local Media and Radio. In connection with this new segment presentation, the presentation of intercompany revenues has been revised, including station affiliation fees paid by Local Media to the CBS Television Network. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.  
    
  Basis of Presentation  -The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the more detailed financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 
    
  Use of Estimates  -The preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  
    
  Other Operating Items, Net  -Other operating items, net for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   includes gains from the sales of businesses, and for 2016 also includes a multiyear, retroactive impact of a new operating tax.  
    
  Loss from Discontinued Operations  -Loss from discontinued operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   reflects the resolution of a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction relating to a previously disposed business that was accounted for as a discontinued operation.  
    
  Net Earnings per Common Share  -Basic net earnings per share ( EPS ) is based upon net earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the effect of the  
  
   -  7  - 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive. Excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, were   5 million   stock options for each of the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, were   7 million   stock options and RSUs for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   and   4 million   stock options for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS. 

Other Liabilities  -Other liabilities consist primarily of the noncurrent portion of residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses, participants  share and royalties payable, program rights obligations, deferred compensation and other employee benefit accruals. 
    
  Additional Paid-In Capital  -For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recorded dividends of   $218 million   and   $222 million  , respectively, as a reduction to additional paid-in capital as the Company had an accumulated deficit balance. 
    
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
  Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments 
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted amended Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) guidance which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination when new information is obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Under the amended guidance the acquirer is required to recognize such adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are identified. Such adjustments also include the effect on earnings from any changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects resulting from the change to provisional amounts, as if the change occurred at the acquisition date. The amendment also requires disclosure or separate presentation on the face of the income statement of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items 
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items. This guidance removes the requirement to assess whether an event or transaction is both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence and to separately present any such items on the statement of operations after income from continuing operations. Rather, such items are required to be presented as a separate component of income from continuing operations or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period 
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for stock-based compensation when the terms of an award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. Under this guidance, such performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company should begin recognizing compensation cost in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved, for the cumulative amount of compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  Recent Pronouncements 
  Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions. Under this amended guidance, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the period in which the awards vest or are exercised. In the statement of cash flows, excess tax benefits will be classified with other income tax cash flows in operating activities. The amended guidance also gives the option to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur and increases the threshold for awards that are partially settled in cash to qualify for equity classification. The Company expects that the adoption of this guidance will introduce volatility into the Company s income tax provision, which will be impacted by the timing of employee exercises and changes in the Company s stock price. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. 
    
  Leases 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for leases, which supersedes previous lease guidance. Under this guidance, for all leases with terms in excess of one year, including operating leases, the Company will be required to recognize on its balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new guidance retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases and the classification criteria is substantially similar to previous guidance. Additionally, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated balance sheets. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. 
    
  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  
  In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance which requires management to evaluate, for each interim and annual reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. If management  
  
   -  9  - 

CBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, disclosures are required in the financial statements, including any plans that will alleviate the substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. This guidance, which is effective for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, is not expected to have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on the recognition of revenues which provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance. The main principle under this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue at the amount it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The Company anticipates that this guidance will result in changes to its revenue recognition and is currently assessing the impact. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  
   
  2  )   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION    
  The following table summarizes the Company s stock-based compensation expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company granted   3 million   RSUs for CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock with a weighted average per unit grant-date fair value of   $47.26  . RSUs granted during the first   nine months   of   2016   generally vest over a   one  - to   four  -year service period. Compensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of grant. For certain RSU awards the number of shares an employee earns ranges from   0%   to   120%   of the target award, based on the outcome of established performance conditions. Compensation expense is recorded based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company also granted   2 million   stock options with a weighted average exercise price of   $45.79  . Stock options granted during the first   nine months   of   2016   vest over a   four  -year service period and expire   eight years   from the date of grant. Compensation expense for stock options is determined based on the grant date fair value of the award calculated using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. 
    
  Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs at   September 30, 2016   was   $237 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   2.4 years  . Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards at   September 30, 2016   was   $50 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of   2.4 years  .

  5  )   BANK FINANCING AND DEBT    
  The following table sets forth the Company s debt. 

(a) At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of   $53 million   and   $45 million  , respectively, (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of   $45 million   and   $44 million  , respectively, and (iii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of   $7 million   and   $14 million  , respectively. The face value of the Company s senior debt was   $8.94 billion   and   $8.44 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  During July 2016, the Company issued   $700 million   of   2.90%     senior notes due 2027  .

Commercial Paper  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $33 million   of outstanding commercial paper borrowings under its   $2.5 billion   commercial paper program at a weighted average interest rate of   0.75%   and with maturities of less than 45 days. The Company had   no   outstanding commercial paper borrowings at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Credit Facility 
  During June 2016, the Company amended and restated its   $2.5 billion   revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ). The amended Credit Facility expires in   June 2021   and contains provisions that are substantially similar to the previous Credit Facility, which was due to expire in December 2019. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of   4.5x   at the end of each quarter as further described in the Credit Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately   2.5x  . 
    
  The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is the ratio of the Company s indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company s Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items. 
    
  The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   no   borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was   $2.49 billion  . 
    
  CBS Radio Indebtedness 
  In October 2016, in connection with the Company s previously announced plans to separate its radio business, CBS Radio borrowed   $1.46 billion   through a   $1.06 billion   senior secured term loan due 2023 (the  Term Loan ) and the issuance of   $400 million   of   7.25%   senior unsecured notes due 2024 through a private placement. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to   3.50% plus the greater of the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) and 1.00%  .  
    
  The Term Loan is part of a credit agreement which also includes a   $250 million   senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Radio Revolving Credit Facility ) which expires in 2021. Interest on the Radio Revolving Credit Facility will be based on either LIBOR or a base rate plus a margin based on CBS Radio s Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio. The Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of CBS Radio s secured debt (less up to $150 million of cash and cash equivalents) to CBS Radio s consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement).   The Radio Revolving Credit Facility requires CBS Radio to maintain a maximum Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio of 4.00 to 1.00  . As of November 3, 2016, there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the Radio Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  This debt is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of CBS Radio.

Class B Common Stock, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes and ongoing cash needs.

(a) 
    Reflects amortization of net actuarial losses. See Note   6  . 
       
  The net actuarial gain (loss) and prior service cost related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans included in other comprehensive income (loss) is net of a tax provision of   $19 million   and   $17 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
   
  8  )   INCOME TAXES    
  The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. 
    
  The provision for income taxes was   $176 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $211 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , reflecting an effective income tax rate of   25.0%   and   32.3%  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the provision for income taxes was   $612 million   compared to   $579 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , reflecting an income tax rate of   29.6%   and   32.8%  , respectively. The lower tax rate for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   includes a one-time benefit of   $47 million   associated with a multiyear adjustment to a tax deduction, which was approved by the Internal Revenue Service during the third quarter of 2016.  
   
  9  )   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    
  Guarantees

  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable. 
    
  Legal Matters  
  General.      On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively,   litigation  ). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named. 
    
  Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.      The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use. 
    
  Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had pending approximately   34,400   asbestos claims, as compared with approximately   36,030   as of   December 31, 2015   and   37,190   as of   September 30, 2015  . During the   third quarter   of   2016  , the Company received approximately   930   new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately   1,320   claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. In   2015  , as the result of an insurance settlement, insurance recoveries exceeded the Company s after tax costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims by approximately   $5 million  . In   2014  , the Company s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance and taxes were approximately   $11 million  . The Company s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses. 
    
  The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in the past five to ten years and has remained flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company s estimate of its asbestos liabilities.

Other.      The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. 
   
  10  )   RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 
  During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of   $81 million  , of which   $55 million   was recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   2015   restructuring charges reflected   $48 million   of severance costs and   $33 million   of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. During the year ended   December 31, 2014  , the Company recorded restructuring charges of   $26 million   reflecting   $17 million   of severance costs and   $9 million   of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative settlements for the   2015   and   2014   restructuring charges were   $83 million  , of which   $54 million   was for severance costs and   $29 million   was for costs associated with contractual obligations.  

11  )   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    
  The Company s carrying value of financial instruments approximates fair value, except for notes and debentures, which are not recorded at fair value. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the Company s senior debt was   $8.85 billion   and   $8.37 billion  , respectively, and the fair value, which is estimated based on quoted market prices for similar liabilities (Level 2) and includes accrued interest, was   $9.90 billion   and   $8.78 billion  , respectively. 
    
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Contracts 
    
  Foreign exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, generally for periods up to 24 months. The Company designates forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income ( OCI ) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the notional amount of all foreign exchange contracts was   $456 million   and   $291 million  , respectively. 
    
  Gains recognized on derivative financial instruments were as follows: 

(a) The gains during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   related to interest rate swaps that were settled during   2015  . 
    
  The fair value of the Company s derivative instruments was not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets for any of the periods presented. 
  The following tables set forth the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . These assets and liabilities have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The fair value of foreign currency hedges is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using observable inputs including foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of deferred compensation liabilities is determined based on the fair value of the investments elected by employees.  
   
  12  )   REPORTABLE SEGMENTS    
  The following tables set forth the Company s financial performance by reportable segment. The Company s operating segments, which are the same as its reportable segments, have been determined in accordance with the Company s internal management structure, which is organized based upon products and services.  
    
  In preparation for the planned separation of its radio business, the Company changed the manner in which it manages its television and radio operations during the   third quarter   of   2016  . Accordingly, the Company s previously reported operating segment, Local Broadcasting, has been separated into two operating segments, Local Media and Radio. In connection with this new segment presentation, the presentation of intercompany revenues has been revised, including station affiliation fees paid by Local Media to the CBS Television Network. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.  

Revenues generated between segments primarily reflect advertising sales, television license fees and station affiliation fees. These transactions are recorded at market value as if the sales were to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.

The Company presents operating income (loss) excluding restructuring charges, impairment charges, and other operating items, net, if any, ( Segment Operating Income ) as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment Operating Income is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company s management and enhances their ability to understand the Company s operating performance. 

(a) Other operating items, net includes gains from the sales of internet businesses in China for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and for   2016  , also includes a multiyear, retroactive impact of a new operating tax.

    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 
        
    (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

Management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (the  Company  or  CBS Corp. ) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Overview 
    
  Business overview and strategy 
  The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television and radio stations, internet-based businesses, and consumer publishing. The Company s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate both advertising and non-advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company continues to increase its investment in both Company-owned and acquired premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting the Company s content on digital and other platforms through licensing and subscription services, including the Company s owned digital streaming services; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors ( MVPDs ) and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and further monetizing delayed viewing. The Company believes that its increased investment in premium content will also enable it to stay ahead of changes in the media and entertainment industry, including new distribution platforms and changes in programming packages offered to consumers.  
    
  Operational highlights   -   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   versus     Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

(a)  See page 33 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reported record third quarter results in revenues, operating income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (  EPS  ), led by growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues, and higher television licensing sales. Diluted EPS also benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding in the   third quarter   of   2016   as a result of the Company s ongoing share repurchase program. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   4%   revenue growth was driven by a   13%   increase in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, reflecting   32%   growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues, as well as revenues from digital distribution platforms, including   CBS All Access   and Showtime Networks  over-the-top digital streaming subscription offering ( Showtime Networks  over-the-top service ). Revenue growth for the   third quarter   of   2016   also reflected a   6%   increase in content licensing and distribution revenues, driven by higher domestic television licensing sales. Advertising revenues for the quarter were impacted by 10 hours of primetime preemptions for the Democratic and Republican conventions and the first Presidential debate as well as competition from the 2016 Summer Olympics, while advertising benefited from higher political spending.  
  
   -  30  - 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
  Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) 
  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

Operating income increased   6%   and diluted EPS grew   31%   from the   third quarter   of   2015   primarily driven by the revenue growth, which was partially offset by an increased investment in programming. In addition, included in diluted EPS for the   third quarter   of   2016   was a one-time tax benefit of   $47 million   associated with a multiyear adjustment to a tax deduction, which was approved by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) during the third quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, excluding this tax benefit, diluted EPS grew   19%  . Diluted EPS also benefited from the Company s ongoing share repurchase program.  
    
  Recent Developments 
  In connection with the Company s previously announced plans to separate its radio business, a preliminary registration statement was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (  SEC  ) during the third quarter of 2016 for the proposed initial public offering of the common stock of CBS Radio Inc. (  CBS Radio  ). Additionally, in October 2016, CBS Radio borrowed   $1.46 billion   through a   $1.06 billion   senior secured term loan (the  Term Loan ) and the issuance of   $400 million   of senior unsecured notes through a private placement. The net debt proceeds will be primarily used by CBS Corp. to repurchase shares of its Class B Common Stock, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes and ongoing cash needs. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company intends to repurchase $1.5 billion of its Class B Common Stock, including $500 million as part of its ongoing repurchase program and $1.0 billion using the net proceeds from the CBS Radio borrowings. These planned repurchases are subject to market and business conditions, and remain at the discretion of management. 
    
  On September 29, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors received a letter from National Amusements, Inc. requesting that the Company consider a potential combination of the Company and Viacom Inc. National Amusements, Inc., directly and indirectly, owns approximately 80% of the voting shares of each of the Company and Viacom Inc. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether to pursue any such potential transaction. No assurance can be given regarding the entry into, consummation or terms of any such potential transaction. 
    
  Operational highlights   -   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   versus   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

(a)  See page 33 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   6%     increase   in revenues was driven by   10%   growth in advertising revenues, reflecting CBS s broadcast of   Super Bowl 50   and   6%   growth in underlying network advertising. Affiliate and subscription fee revenues increased   8%  , driven by   39%   growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues, as well as revenues from digital distribution platforms. These increases were partially offset by the benefit to   2015   from Showtime Networks  distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao boxing event. Content licensing and distribution revenues declined   4%  , reflecting lower domestic licensing sales compared with the first nine months of   2015  , which included significant licensing sales of   NCIS   and   Elementary  ,

  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

partially offset by growth from international licensing, mainly from the sales of all episodes of five   Star Trek   series. 
    
  Operating income grew   14%   and diluted EPS increased   33%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily driven by the higher revenues. In addition, for the   nine months ended     September 30,     2015  , operating income and diluted EPS included restructuring charges of $  55 million   and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , diluted EPS included the aforementioned tax benefit of   $47 million  . The EPS comparison also benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company s ongoing share repurchase program.  
    
  The Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of   $1.31 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared with   $650 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Free cash flow for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $1.18 billion   compared with   $546 million   for the same prior-year period. These increases were primarily driven by growth in affiliate and subscription fees and higher advertising revenues, including from the broadcast of   Super Bowl 50   on CBS, partially offset by increased investment in content. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See  Free Cash Flow  on pages 49 - 50 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.  
    
  Share Repurchases and Dividends 
  On July 28, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company s share repurchase program to a total availability of $6.0 billion. During the   third quarter   of   2016  , the Company repurchased   9.5 million   shares of its Class B Common Stock under its share repurchase program for   $500 million  , at an average cost of   $52.77   per share. During the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016  , the Company repurchased   29.0 million   shares of its Class B Common Stock for   $1.50 billion  , at an average cost of   $51.76   per share, leaving   $5.60 billion   of authorization at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On July 28, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 20% increase to the quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock to   $.18   from $.15 per share. The total   third quarter     2016   dividend was   $80 million  , which was paid on   October 1, 2016  .

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
  Results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   included discrete items that were not part of the normal course of operations. The following tables present adjusted operating income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which exclude the impact of these discrete items. These adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled below to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that presenting its financial results adjusted for the impact of discrete items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company s management and provides a clearer perspective on the underlying performance of the Company. 

(a) Other operating items, net includes gains from the sales of internet businesses in China for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and for   2016  , also includes a multiyear, retroactive impact of a new operating tax. 
  (b) Reflects a one-time tax benefit associated with a multiyear adjustment to a tax deduction, which was approved by the IRS during the third quarter of 2016. 
  (c) Amounts may not sum as a result of rounding.

  Revenues 

Advertising 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , advertising revenues decreased   1%  . Advertising revenues were impacted by 10 hours of primetime preemptions for the Democratic and Republican conventions and the first Presidential debate, competition from the 2016 Summer Olympics, and sales of internet businesses in China during 2015. Advertising revenues during the   third quarter   benefited from increased political advertising sales relating to U.S. federal and state elections. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   10%     increase   in advertising revenues was driven by CBS s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract;   6%   growth in underlying network advertising; and higher political advertising sales. These increases were partially offset by the impact from the sales of internet businesses in China during 2015.  
    
  During the fourth quarter of 2016, local advertising revenues are expected to continue to benefit from political advertising spending associated with U.S. federal and state elections. Additionally, the CBS Television Network s upfront advertising sales ( Upfront ) for the 2016/2017 television broadcast season, which runs from the middle of September 2016 through the middle of September 2017, resulted in pricing increases compared with the prior broadcast season, which is expected to benefit advertising revenues during the 2016/2017 broadcast season. However, overall advertising revenues for the Company will be dependent on ratings for its programming and market conditions, including demand in the scatter advertising market, which is when advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming.  
    
  Content Licensing and Distribution 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   6%     increase   in content licensing and distribution revenues was driven by higher domestic television licensing, primarily reflecting the sales of   Showtime   original series, including   Penny Dreadful,   as well as various titles from the Company s television library, partially offset by the

initial domestic availability of   Elementary   in the third quarter of 2015. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   4%     decrease   in content licensing and distribution revenues reflects lower domestic television licensing revenues, as the first nine months of   2015   included significant sales of   NCIS   and   Elementary  . This decrease was partially offset by growth from the international licensing of five   Star Trek   series and the domestic licensing sale of   Penny Dreadful  . 
    
  For the remainder of   2016  , the content and licensing distribution revenue comparison will continue to be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of when Company-owned television series are made available for multiyear licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. 
    
  Affiliate and Subscription Fees 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   13%     increase   in affiliate and subscription fees reflects   32%   growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues, and revenues from digital distribution platforms, including   CBS All Access   and Showtime Networks  over-the-top service. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   8%     increase   in affiliate and subscription fees was driven by   39%   growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues, and revenues from digital distribution platforms. These increases were partially offset by the benefit to 2015 from Showtime Networks  distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao pay-per-view boxing event, which was the highest grossing pay-per-view event of all time.  
    
  Over the next few years the Company expects to renew a significant portion of its agreements with station affiliates and MVPDs. This, along with the Company s digital distribution initiatives, are expected to result in continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees. 
    
  International Revenues 
  The Company generated approximately   10%   and   12%   of its total revenues from international regions for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and generated approximately   13%   and   14%   of its total revenues from international regions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.

  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   2%     increase   in programming expenses was driven by higher sports programming costs associated with the broadcast of NFL games partially offset by lower costs for acquired television series. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   7%     increase   in programming expenses was primarily driven by increased sports programming costs associated with the broadcast of NFL games, including   Super Bowl 50   which was broadcast by CBS in 2016. This increase was     partially offset by costs in 2015 associated with Showtime Networks  distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao pay-per-view boxing event and lower costs for acquired television series as a result of a shift to a higher mix of internally developed television series.   
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   3%   increase in production expenses was mainly driven by higher costs associated with the increase in television licensing revenues. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   6%     increase   in production expenses was the result of increased investment in internally developed series and costs associated with the Super Bowl production in 2016, partially offset by lower costs associated with the decrease in television licensing revenues. 
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   7%     increase   in participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily reflects higher participations and residuals resulting from the increase in television licensing revenues. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   4%     decrease   in participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily reflects lower participations and residuals associated with lower television licensing revenues.  
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , SG A expenses increased   7%   and   5%  , respectively, primarily as a result of higher pension and other employee-related costs. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   increase   also reflects higher advertising costs associated with the timing of series premieres on   Showtime.

Depreciation and Amortization 

For each of the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   6%     decrease   in depreciation and amortization was the result of intangibles and property and equipment that became fully amortized, as well as the sales of internet businesses in China during 2015. 
    
  Restructuring Charges 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of   $55 million  , reflecting $34 million of severance costs and $21 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.  
    
  Other Operating Items, Net 

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016 and 2015  , other operating items, net includes gains from the sales of internet businesses in China, and for   2016  , also includes a multiyear, retroactive impact of a new operating tax.

  Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax 

For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax includes a   $6 million   write-down of an international television joint venture to its fair value. 
    
  Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations 

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the increases in net earnings from continuing operations of   21%   and   22%  , respectively, and the increases in diluted EPS from continuing operations of   31%   and   33%  , respectively, were each driven by higher operating income and a lower effective tax rate. The increases in diluted EPS also reflect lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company s ongoing share repurchase program.

Segment Results of Operations 
  In preparation for the planned separation of its radio business, the Company changed the manner in which it manages its television and radio operations during the third quarter of 2016. Accordingly, the Company s previously reported operating segment, Local Broadcasting, has been separated into two operating segments, Local Media and Radio. In connection with this new segment presentation, the presentation of intercompany revenues has been revised, including station affiliation fees paid by Local Media to the CBS Television Network. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.  
    
  The Company presents operating income (loss) excluding restructuring charges, impairment charges, and other operating items, net, if any, ( Segment Operating Income ) as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment Operating Income is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company s management and enhances their ability to understand the Company s operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to the Company s consolidated Net earnings is presented in Note   12   (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

  Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015 

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   1%     increase   in revenues was driven by a   39%   increase in affiliate and subscription fees, led by higher station affiliation fees and subscription growth for   CBS All Access.   This growth was largely offset by   4%   lower advertising revenues and   3%   lower content licensing and distribution revenues. Advertising revenues were impacted by 10 hours of primetime preemptions for the Democratic and Republican conventions and the first Presidential debate, competition from the 2016 Summer Olympics, and sales of internet businesses in China during   2015  . The decrease in content licensing and distribution revenues reflects the initial domestic availability of   Elementary   in the   third quarter   of   2015  , partially offset by sales of various titles from the Company s television library during the   third quarter   of   2016  .

  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   8%     increase   in revenues was driven by   19%   growth in network advertising revenues, driven by the broadcast of   Super Bowl 50   and   6%   growth in underlying network advertising. Additionally, affiliate and subscription fees grew   54%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as a result of higher station affiliation fees and subscription growth for   CBS All Access  . These increases were partially offset by   8%   lower content licensing and distribution revenues due to lower domestic television licensing, as   2015   benefited from the significant licensing sales of   NCIS   and   Elementary  , partially offset by growth in international licensing revenues mainly from the sales of five   Star Trek   series.     The revenue comparison was also     impacted by the sales of internet businesses in China during 2015.  
    
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the   21%     increase   in operating income was primarily a result of the increase in revenues. Restructuring charges for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily reflected severance costs.

  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   16%     increase   in operating income primarily reflects the revenue growth partially offset by increased investment in original series.

Investing Activities    

(a) 2016 primarily reflects the acquisition of a sports-focused digital media business. 
  (b) Primarily reflects the timing of capital projects. Capital expenditures for the full year 2016 are expected to be at a similar level as the prior three years, which ranged from $193 million to $212 million. 
  (c) Mainly includes the Company s investment in The CW as well as its other domestic and international television joint ventures. 
  (d) Primarily reflects sales of internet businesses in China. 
    
  Financing Activities  

Free Cash Flow 
  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and less capital expenditures. The Company s calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company s operations. The Company s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
  Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) 
  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company s ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company s operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company s operating performance to other companies in its industry. 
    
  As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company s ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow. 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company s net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow. 

Repurchase of Company Stock and Cash Dividends  
  On July 28, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company s share repurchase program to a total availability of $6.0 billion. During the   third quarter   of   2016  , the Company repurchased   9.5 million   shares of its Class B Common Stock under its share repurchase program for   $500 million  , at an average cost of   $52.77   per share. During the   nine months ended     September 30,     2016  , the Company repurchased   29.0 million   shares of its Class B Common Stock for   $1.50 billion  , at an average cost of   $51.76   per share, leaving   $5.60 billion   of authorization at   September 30, 2016  . Repurchases are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations, and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company intends to repurchase $1.5 billion of its Class B Common Stock, including $500 million as part of its ongoing repurchase program and $1.0 billion using the net proceeds from the CBS Radio borrowings. These planned repurchases are subject to market and business conditions, and remain at the discretion of management.

On July 28, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 20% increase to the quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common stock to   $.18   from $.15 per share. The total   third quarter     2016   dividend was   $80 million  , which was paid on   October 1, 2016  . 

Capital Structure 
  The following table sets forth the Company s debt. 

(a) At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of   $53 million   and   $45 million  , respectively, (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of   $45 million   and   $44 million  , respectively, and (iii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of   $7 million   and   $14 million  , respectively. The face value of the Company s senior debt was   $8.94 billion   and   $8.44 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  During July 2016, the Company issued   $700 million   of   2.90%     senior notes due 2027  . The Company used the net proceeds from this issuance for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock and repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper. 
    
  During January 2016, the Company repaid its   $200 million   of outstanding   7.625%   senior debentures upon maturity. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company classified   $400 million   of debt maturing in   July 2017   as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, reflecting its intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis. 
    
  Commercial Paper  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $33 million   of outstanding commercial paper borrowings under its   $2.5 billion   commercial paper program at a weighted average interest rate of   0.75%   and with maturities of less than 45 days. The Company had   no   outstanding commercial paper borrowings at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Credit Facility 
  During June 2016, the Company amended and restated its   $2.5 billion   revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ). The amended Credit Facility expires in   June 2021   and contains provisions that are substantially similar to the previous Credit Facility, which was due to expire in December 2019. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.5x at the end of each quarter as further described in the Credit Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately   2.5x  . 
    
  The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is the ratio of the Company s indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company s Consolidated EBITDA for the  
  
   -  51  - 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
  Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) 
  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items. 
    
  The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was   $2.49 billion  . 
    
  CBS Radio Indebtedness 
  In October 2016, in connection with the Company s previously announced plans to separate its radio business, CBS Radio borrowed   $1.46 billion   through a   $1.06 billion   senior secured term loan due 2023 and the issuance of   $400 million   of   7.25%   senior unsecured notes due 2024 through a private placement. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to 3.50% plus the greater of LIBOR and 1.00%.  
    
  The Term Loan is part of a credit agreement which also includes a   $250 million   senior secured revolving credit facility (the  Radio Revolving Credit Facility ) which expires in 2021. Interest on the Radio Revolving Credit Facility will be based on either LIBOR or a base rate plus a margin based on CBS Radio s Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio. The Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of CBS Radio s secured debt (less up to $150 million of cash and cash equivalents) to CBS Radio s consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). The Radio Revolving Credit Facility requires CBS Radio to maintain a maximum Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio of 4.00 to 1.00. As of November 3, 2016, there were   no   borrowings outstanding under the Radio Revolving Credit Facility. 
    
  This debt is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of CBS Radio. The Company does not guarantee, or otherwise provide credit support for, the senior notes, Term Loan, or Radio Revolving Credit Facility. The net debt proceeds will be primarily used by the Company to repurchase shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes and ongoing cash needs.  
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company s operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company s investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows; cash and cash equivalents; borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, which had   $2.49 billion   of remaining availability at   September 30, 2016  ; and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. 
    
  The Company s funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs.     The Company routinely assesses its capital structure and opportunistically enters into transactions to lower its interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt. 
    
  Funding for the Company s long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of   $2.10 billion   is expected to come from the Company s ability to refinance its debt and cash generated from operating activities.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
  Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) 
  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company intends to repurchase $1.5 billion of its Class B Common Stock, including $500 million as part of its ongoing repurchase program and $1.0 billion using the net proceeds from the CBS Radio borrowings. These planned repurchases are subject to market and business conditions, and remain at the discretion of management. 

Legal Matters 
  General.      On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively,   litigation  ). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named. 
    
  Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos.      The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use. 
    
  Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had pending approximately 34,400 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately   36,030   as of   December 31, 2015   and 37,190 as of   September 30, 2015  . During the   third quarter   of   2016  , the Company received approximately   930   new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately   1,320   claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. In   2015  , as the result of an insurance settlement, insurance recoveries exceeded the Company s after tax costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims by approximately   $5 million  . In   2014  , the Company s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance and taxes were approximately   $11 million  . The Company s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses. 
    
  Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease  
  
   -  53  - 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
  Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) 
  (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in the past five to ten years and has remained flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company s estimate of its asbestos liabilities. 
    
  Other.      The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.

  Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, in connection with its new segment presentation, the Company allocated the goodwill for its Radio segment into three reporting units. The estimated fair value of each of these three reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value by less than 1%, which is consistent with the results of the Company s 2015 annual impairment test for its CBS Radio reporting unit. The assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated fair values of the three Radio reporting units were similar to those used in the Company s 2015 annual impairment test for its CBS Radio reporting unit, as disclosed in the discussion of critical accounting policies in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .

  The Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment Charges for Goodwill, Intangible Assets, FCC Licenses and Programming 
    
  In connection with the Company s new segment presentation, the Company allocated the goodwill for its Radio segment into three reporting units. The estimated fair value of each of these three reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value by less than 1%, which is consistent with the results of the Company s   2015   annual impairment test for its CBS Radio reporting unit. In addition, as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  , based on the Company s annual impairment test for FCC licenses performed during the fourth quarter of   2015  , the carrying value of FCC licenses in eighteen radio markets was equal to their respective fair values, and the carrying value of FCC licenses in four radio markets was within 10% of their respective estimated fair values. Any downward revisions to the estimated fair value of the three Radio reporting units and/or these FCC licenses could cause the estimated fair values to fall below their respective carrying values, which could result in a noncash impairment charge. Any impairment charge for goodwill and/or FCC licenses could have a material adverse effect on the Company s reported net earnings.

Since then, various increases to such amount have been approved and announced, including most recently, an increase to the share repurchase program to a total availability of $6.0 billion on July 28, 2016. Below is a summary of CBS Corp. s purchases of its Class B Common Stock during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .

The payments provided for in paragraph 7(f) are in lieu of any other severance or income continuation or protection under any CBS plan, program or agreement that may now or hereafter exist (unless the terms of such plan, program or agreement expressly state that the payments and benefits payable thereunder are intended to be in addition to the type of payments and benefits described in paragraph 7(f) of this Agreement). 
  (g)      Retirement  .

Outstanding Awards in the form of stock options and stock appreciation rights (   Outstanding     Stock     Rights   ), once vested, shall remain exercisable until their expiration date.  The exercisability of stock options and stock appreciation rights that are outstanding and vested on the date of your Retirement shall be governed by the terms and conditions otherwise applicable to those grants.

You agree that this Agreement shall serve as written notice of resignation in this circumstance.  If, however, for any reason this paragraph 7(h) is deemed insufficient to effectuate such resignation, you agree to execute, upon the request of CBS or any of its affiliated companies, any documents or instruments which CBS may deem necessary or desirable to effectuate such resignation or resignations, and you hereby authorize the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary of CBS or any of CBS s affiliated companies to execute any such documents or instruments as your attorney-in-fact.

  (i)     delivered in full; or

  as of September 29, 2016 
  Page 37

  (b)     In the event that a reduction of 280G Amounts is made in accordance with this paragraph 18, the reduction will occur, with respect to the 280G Amounts considered parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, in the following order: 
  (i)         reduction of the accelerated vesting of any stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the then current fair market value; 
    
  (ii)        reduction of cash payments in reverse chronological order (  i.e.,   the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the excise tax will be the first cash payment to be reduced); 
    
  (iii)       cancellation of equity awards other than those described in clause (i) above that were granted  contingent on a change in ownership or control  within the meaning of Code Section 280G, in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (  i.e.,   the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); 
    
  (iv)       reduction of the accelerated vesting of equity awards other than those described in clause (i) above in the reverse order of date of grant of the awards (  i.e.,   the vesting of the most recently granted equity awards will be cancelled first); and 
    
  (v)        reduction of employee benefits in reverse chronological order (  i.e.,   the benefit owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering the excise tax will be the first benefit to be reduced). 
    
  In no event will you have any discretion with respect to the ordering of payment reductions. 
  (c)     Unless you and CBS otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this paragraph 18 will be made in writing by a nationally recognized accounting or valuation firm (the    Firm   ) selected by CBS, whose  

Anthony G. Ambrosio

determination will be conclusive and binding upon you and CBS for all purposes.  For purposes of making the calculations required by this paragraph 18, the Firm may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  CBS and you will furnish to the Firm such information and documents as the Firm may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this paragraph 18.  CBS will bear all costs for payment of the Firm s services in connection with any calculations contemplated by this paragraph 18.

CERTIFICATION 
  I, Leslie Moonves, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of CBS Corporation; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
