EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  Zebra Technologies Corporation (the "Company") is filing this Amendment No. 2 to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q/A") for the quarter-ended April 2, 2016, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 10, 2016 as amended on May 25, 2016 by Amendment No. 1 (collectively, the "Original Filing"). The Company is filing this Form 10-Q/A to reflect restatements of its Consolidated Balance Sheet at April 2, 2016, its Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Loss, and Cash Flows for the three months ended April 2, 2016, and the related notes thereto, as a result of the correction of errors primarily related to the Company's underaccrual of certain 2015 estimates, most notably for its sales commissions plan, its accounting for income taxes and an error to the net realizable value of acquired trade receivables impacting goodwill and general and administrative expenses. 
  By restating our financial statements to correct the errors discussed above, we are making adjustments for previously identified accounting errors deemed immaterial in aggregate with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015, which were recorded in the Company's 2016 financial results. When these financial statements were originally issued, we assessed the impact of these unrecorded adjustments and concluded that they were not material individually or in the aggregate to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 or the three months ended April 2, 2016. In conjunction with the restatement, we have determined that it is appropriate within this Amendment to reflect these adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements. Please refer to Note 2 -  Restatement  included in our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this Amendment for more information regarding the impact of these adjustments. 
    
  The following sections in the Original Filing are revised in this Form 10-Q/A, solely as a result of, and to reflect the restatement: 

Part I - Item 1   Consolidated Financial Statements 
        
    Part 1 - Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
        
    Part I - Item 4   Controls and Procedures 
        
    Part II - Item 6   Exhibits 

Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, Part II, item 6 of the Original Filing has been amended for the currently-dated certifications from the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer are included to this Form 10-Q/A as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. 
    
  For the convenience of the reader, this Form 10-Q/A sets forth the information in the Original Filing in its entirety, as such information is modified and superseded where necessary to reflect the restatement and related revisions. Except as provided above, this amendment does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Filing on May 10, 2016. Accordingly, this Form 10-Q/A should be read in conjunction with the Company's filings with the SEC subsequent to May 10, 2016.

ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Zebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Zebra" or "Company") is a global leader respected for innovative Enterprise Asset Intelligence ( EAI ) solutions in the automatic information and data capture solutions industry. We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products that capture and move data, including: mobile computers; barcode scanners and imagers; radio frequency identification device ("RFID") readers; wireless LAN ( WLAN ) solutions and software; specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification; real-time location systems ( RTLS  related accessories and supplies such as self-adhesive labels and other consumables; and utilities and application software. End-users of our products include those in the retail, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, and education industries around the world. Benefits of our solutions include improved efficiency and workflow management, increased productivity and asset utilization, real-time, actionable enterprise information, and better customer experiences.  
    
  In October 2014, Zebra acquired the Enterprise business ("Enterprise") from Motorola Solutions, Inc. ( MSI ) for   $3.45 billion   in cash (the "Acquisition"). Enterprise is an industry leader in mobile computing and advanced data capture technologies and services, which complement Zebra s barcode printing and RFID products. Its products include rugged and enterprise-grade mobile computers; barcode scanners and imagers; RFID readers; WLAN solutions and software; and services that are associated with these products. Enterprise service revenues include sales arising from maintenance, repair, product support, system installation and integration services, and other services. 
    
  Management prepared these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for Zebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information and notes. These financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements, although management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Therefore, these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
  In the opinion of the Company, these interim financial statements include all adjustments (of a normal, recurring nature) necessary to present fairly its consolidated balance sheet as of April 2, 2016 and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss and cash flows for the three months ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015. These results, however, are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.  

Note 2 Restatement 
    
  During the first half of 2016, the Company identified certain errors in its 2015 annual consolidated financial statements primarily related to the underaccrual of certain 2015 estimates, most notably for its sales commission plan, which were partially offset by tax-related items. These errors were originally corrected in the first half of 2016 by recording   $11 million   of additional pre-tax expenses, primarily within operating expenses, which when combined with tax-related items resulted in a   $7 million   increase to the net loss within the consolidated statement of operations as of the six months ended July 2, 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company identified additional income tax errors related to 2015 and an error to the net realizable value of trade receivables acquired in connection with the Company's acquisition of the Enterprise business of Motorola Solutions, Inc impacting goodwill and general and administrative expenses. The Company has concluded that these errors were material, in the aggregate, to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  By restating our financial statements to correct the errors discussed above, we are making adjustments for previously identified accounting errors deemed immaterial with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015, which were recorded in the Company's 2016 financial results. In conjunction with the restatement, we have determined that it would be appropriate within  this Amendment to reflect these adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Loss, and Cash Flows, and Notes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, and 18 in these financial statements were updated to reflect the restatement. 
  The tables below present the impact of the changes to the Company's financial statement line items:

Note 3 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  Recently Adopted 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-5,    Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.    This update provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license or should be accounted for differently. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance does not change generally accepted accounting principles for a customer s accounting for service contracts. This update is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has prospectively adopted this new standard on January 1, 2016 and concluded that it does not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, "  Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting revenue gross versus net)  ," which clarifies gross versus net revenue reporting when another party is involved in the transaction. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ," which amends the revenue guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. There are two transition methods available under the new standard, either cumulative effect or retrospective. The standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018. Earlier adoption is permitted only for annual periods after December 15, 2016. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,    Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,    which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value for entities that measure inventory using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods therein.  Earlier adoption is permitted and the guidance must be applied prospectively after the date of adoption. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,"   which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017 and will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition approach depending on the area covered in this update. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,    Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."   ASU 2016-01 modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicality exception. A practicality exception will apply to those equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under ASC 820, "  Fair Value Measurements,"   and as such these investments may be measured at cost. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and subsequent interim periods. Early adoption of the amendment in this ASU is not permitted. Amendments should be applied by means of cumulative effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values including disclosure requirements should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the ASU. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases (Subtopic 842)."   This ASU increases the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The recognition, measurement, presentation and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed. There are two approaches for amortizing the right-of-use asset. Under the finance lease approach, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset. Repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments will be classified as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Under the operating lease approach, the cost of the lease is calculated on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term. All cash payments are classified as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. It is effective for public entities for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. Management is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

Note 4 Fair Value Measurements 
  Financial assets and liabilities are to be measured using inputs from 3 levels of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC Topic 820,    Fair Value Measurements  .  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into the following 3 broad levels: 
  Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair                         value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. 
  Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data. 
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. 
  In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. In addition, the Company considers counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value. 
  Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of April 2, 2016, are classified below (in millions):

(1) The fair value of the derivative contracts is calculated as follows: 
  a. Fair value of a put option contract associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using bid and ask 
       rates for similar contracts. 
  b. Fair value of regular forward contracts associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using the period-end 
       exchange rate adjusted for current forward points. 
  c. Fair value of hedges against net assets is calculated at the period end exchange rate adjusted for current forward 
      points (Level 2). If the hedge has been traded but not settled at period end, the fair value is calculated at the 
      rate at which the hedge is being settled (Level 1). As a result, transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 of the fair 
      value hierarchy totaled   $6 million   each as of April 2, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
  (2) The fair value of forward interest rate swaps is based upon a valuation model that uses relevant observable market inputs 
        at the quoted intervals, such as forward yield curves, and is adjusted for the Company s credit risk and the interest rate  
        swap terms. See gross balance reporting in Note 10 Derivative Instruments.

Note 10 Derivative Instruments 
  The Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies; as such, the Company manages these risks using derivative financial instruments. The exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from cross-border financing activities between subsidiaries and foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Therefore, the goal is to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible, and once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign exchange forward and option contracts with third parties. 
  The Company entered into a credit agreement which provides for a term loan of   $2.2 billion   ( Term Loan ) and a revolving credit facility of   $250.0 million   ( Revolving Credit Facility ). See Note 12 Long-Term Debt. As such, the Company has exposure to market risk for changes in interest expense calculated off of variable interest rates on the term facility that was used to fund the Acquisition. The Company entered into forward interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the Term Loan. 
  The fair value of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts is estimated using market quoted forward interest rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) at the balance sheet date and the application of such rates subject to the interest rate swap terms. In accordance with ASC 815,    Derivative and Hedging  ,  the Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated as and qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. 
  Credit and Market Risk 
  Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to interest and currency exchange rates. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Its counterparties in derivative transactions are commercial banks with significant experience using derivative instruments. The Company monitors the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restricts the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company s credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. 
  Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 
  The Company has determined that derivative instruments for hedges that have traded but have not settled are considered Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, and hedges that have not traded are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged derivative financial instruments. The foreign currency exchange contracts are valued using broker quotations or market transactions, in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. 
  Non-Designated Foreign Currency Derivatives 
  The Company uses forward contracts to manage exposure related to its British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Czech Koruna, Brazilian Real, Malaysian Ringgit, and Euro denominated net assets. Forward contracts typically mature within three months after execution of the contracts. The Company records monetary gains and losses on these contracts and options in income each quarter along with the transaction gains and losses related to its net asset positions, which would ordinarily offset each other.

Hedging of Anticipated Sales 
  The Company manages the exchange rate risk of anticipated Euro denominated sales using put options, forward contracts, collars and participating forwards. The Company designates these contracts as cash flow hedges which mature within twelve months after the execution of the contracts. Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in other comprehensive income until the contracts are settled and the hedged sales are realized. The deferred gain or loss will then be reported as an increase or decrease to sales. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company expanded its hedging activities to manage the exposure from the Enterprise segment related to fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates. The impact is reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

Forward Interest Rate Swaps 
  The forward interest rate swaps hedge the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest payments on the Company s Term Loan. 
  In June 2014, the Company entered into a commitment letter for a new variable rate credit facility to fund the Acquisition and also entered into   2   tranches of floating-to-fixed forward interest rate swaps ( Original Swaps ). These Original Swaps were used to economically hedge interest rate risk associated with the variable rate commitment until July 30, 2014, and as such, changes in their fair value were recognized in earnings in other (expense) income. Effective July 30, 2014, the Original Swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows on the variable rate commitment. On October 27, 2014, the variable rate commitment was funded and the Company entered into a Term Loan that accrues interest at a variable rate of LIBOR (subject to a floor of   0.75%   per annum) plus a margin of   4.0%  . On October 30, 2014, the Company discontinued hedge accounting for the Original Swaps due to the syndication of the Original Swaps to a group of commercial banks ( Syndicated Swaps ), which resulted in their termination. The changes in fair value of the Original Swaps between July 30, 2014 and their termination were included in other comprehensive (loss) income and any ineffectiveness was insignificant. The amounts included in other comprehensive (loss) income will be amortized to earnings in other (expense) income as the interest payments under the Term Loan affect earnings. The Syndicated Swaps were not designated as hedges and the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in other (expense) income. 
  On November 20, 2014, the Company entered into additional floating-to-fixed forward starting interest rate swaps ( New Swaps ) and designated these as cash flow hedges of interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows on its Term Loan. To offset the impact to earnings of the changes in fair value of the Syndicated Swaps, the Company also entered into fixed-to-floating forward starting interest rate swaps ( Offsetting Swaps ), which were not designated in a hedging relationship and the changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings in other income (expense). Changes in fair value of the New Swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective at offsetting variability in the future cash flows on the Company s Term Loan are recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income. Any ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings. 
  The balance sheet position of the New Swaps designated in a hedge relationship is as follows (in millions, except percentages): 

The forward interest rate swaps not designated in a hedging relationship are recorded in a net liability position of   $9 million   as of April 2, 2016 and   $11 million   as of December 31, 2015 in the consolidated balance sheets.

The notional amount of the designated New Swaps effective in each year of the cash flow hedge relationships does not exceed the principal amount of the Term Loan which is hedged.  
  The New Swaps have the following notional amounts per year (in millions):

Note 12 Long-Term Debt 
  Private Offering 
  On October 15, 2014, the Company completed a private offering of   $1.05 billion   aggregate principal of   7.25%   Senior Notes due October 15, 2022 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes yielded an effective interest rate of   7.61%   at issuance. The Senior Notes are governed by the terms of the indenture, dated as of October 15, 2014, by and among the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee.   Interest on the Senior Notes is payable in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year.    
  The indenture covering the Senior Notes contains certain covenants limiting among other things, the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, with certain exceptions as described in the indenture, to: (i) incur indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; (ii) incur liens; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock; (iv) purchase or redeem capital stock; (v) make investments or certain other restricted payments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) issue or sell stock of restricted subsidiaries; (viii) enter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates; or (ix) effect a consolidation or merger. 
  The Senior Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior and unsecured basis by its direct and indirect wholly-owned existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The Senior Notes rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to the secured obligations of the Company and subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations. 
  Credit Facilities 
  On October 27, 2014, the Company entered into a credit agreement, which provides for a term loan of   $2.2 billion   and a revolving credit facility of   $250 million  . Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin, subject to an all-in floor of   4.75%  . As of April 2, 2016, the Term Loan interest rate was   4.75%  . Interest payments are payable quarterly. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its long-term debt. See Note 10 Derivative Instruments. 
  The credit agreement requires the Company to prepay the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, under certain circumstances or transactions defined in the credit agreement. Also, the Company may make optional prepayments of the Term Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The Company made optional principal prepayments of   $80 million   during the three months ended April 2, 2016. Unless satisfied by further optional prepayments, the Company is required to make a scheduled principal payment of   $1.96 billion   due on   October 27, 2021  .

     Table of Contents  

The Revolving Credit Facility is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including letters of credit. The amount (including letters of credit) shall not exceed   $250 million  . As of April 2, 2016, the Company had established letters of credit amounting to   $3 million  , which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to   $247 million  . The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and the related commitments will terminate on   October 27, 2019  . 
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of April 2, 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility interest rate was   3.25%   and the outstanding letters of credit fee was   2.50%  . Interest payments are payable quarterly. As of April 2, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any borrowings against the Revolving Credit Facility. 
  In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee to the lenders with respect to the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate is currently   0.375%  . The commitment fee rate will be adjusted to   0.250%  ,   0.375%   or   0.500%   depending on the Company s consolidated total secured net leverage ratio.  
  The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants limiting among other things, the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, with certain exceptions as described in the agreement, to: (i) incur indebtedness, make guarantees or issue certain equity securities; (ii) pay dividends on its capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire its capital stock; (iii) make certain investments, loans and acquisitions; (iv) sell certain assets or issue capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; (v) create liens or engage in sale-leaseback transactions; (vi) merge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets; (vii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (viii) alter the business it conducts; (ix) amend, prepay, redeem or purchase subordinated debt; and (x) enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires the Company to comply with a financial covenant consisting of a quarterly maximum consolidated total secured net leverage ratio test that will be tested only at the end of the fiscal quarter if   20%   of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility have been drawn and remain outstanding.  
  The Term Loan and obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets as defined in the security agreement and guaranteed by its direct and indirect wholly-owned existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. 
  The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company s debt (in millions): 

The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term debt approximated   $3.1 billion   at April 2, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These fair value amounts represent the estimated value at which the Company s lenders could trade its debt within the financial markets and does not represent the settlement value of these long-term debt liabilities to the Company. The fair value of the long-term debt will continue to vary each period based on fluctuations in market interest rates, as well as changes to the Company s credit ratings. This methodology resulted in a Level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy. 
   
  Note 13 Contingencies 
    
  The Company is subject to a variety of investigations, claims, suits and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to, intellectual property, employment, tort and breach of contract matters. The Company currently believes that the outcomes of such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its business, cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. Any legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the Company's view of these matters and its potential effects may change in the future.   
    
  In connection with the acquisition of the Enterprise business from Motorola Solutions, Inc., the Company acquired Symbol Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Motorola Solutions ( Symbol ). A putative federal class action lawsuit,   Waring v. Symbol  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

Technologies, Inc., et al.  , was filed on August 16, 2005 against Symbol Technologies, Inc. and   two   of its former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by Robert Waring. After the filing of the   Waring   action, several additional purported class actions were filed against Symbol and the same former officers making substantially similar allegations (collectively, the New Class Actions ). The Waring action and the New Class Actions were consolidated for all purposes and on April 26, 2006, the Court appointed the Iron Workers Local # 580 Pension Fund as lead plaintiff and approved its retention of lead counsel on behalf of the putative class. On August 30, 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (the  Amended Complaint ), and named additional former officers and directors of Symbol as defendants. The lead plaintiff alleges that the defendants misrepresented the effectiveness of Symbol s internal controls and forecasting processes, and that, as a result, all of the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and the individual defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lead plaintiff alleges that it was damaged by the decline in the price of Symbol s stock following certain purported corrective disclosures and seeks unspecified damages. By orders entered on June 25 and August 3, 2015, the court granted lead plaintiff s motion for class certification, certifying a class of investors that includes those that purchased Symbol common stock between April 29, 2003 and August 1, 2005. The parties have substantially completed fact and expert discovery. However, by order entered on January 8, 2016, the court granted Symbol s request for certain additional fact and expert discovery; pursuant to a proposed scheduling order filed on January 21, 2016, the parties agreed to complete that discovery by approximately June 17, 2016. There are also certain discovery motions pending that could, if granted, reopen fact discovery. The court has held in abeyance all other deadlines, including the deadline for the filing of dispositive motions, and has not set a date for trial. One of the insurers in our insurance group has denied insurance coverage and is not agreeing to reimburse defense costs incurred by the Company in connection with this matter. The Company establishes an accrued liability for loss contingencies related to legal matters when the loss is both probable and estimable. In addition, for some matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of loss is not possible, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Currently, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the amount of reasonably possible losses for this matter. 

Note 14 Loss per Share 
    
  Loss per share were computed as follows (in millions, except share data): 

Anti-dilutive securities consist primarily of stock appreciation rights (SARs) with an exercise price greater than the average market closing price of the Class A common stock. 
  Due to a net loss in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, options, awards and warrants were anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the earnings per share calculation. These excluded outstanding options, awards and warrants are as follows:

Note 15 Share-Based Compensation 
  The Company has share-based compensation and employee stock purchase plans under which shares of the Company s Class A common stock are available for future grants and sales.  
  Pre-tax share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations was   $9 million   for the three-month periods ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015, respectively. Tax related benefits of   $3 million   were also recognized for the three-month periods ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015, respectively. 
  The fair value of share-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial model. Volatility is based on an average of the implied volatility in the open market and the annualized volatility of the Company s stock price over its entire stock history. Stock option grants in the table below include both stock options, all of which were non-qualified, and stock appreciation rights (SARs) that will be settled in the Class A common stock or cash. Restricted stock grants are valued at the market closing price on the grant date.  
  The following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used for grants of SARs as well as the fair value based on those assumptions: 

SAR activity was as follows:

  As of April 2, 2016, total unearned compensation costs related to the Company s share-based compensation plans was   $37 million   which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining service period of   2.2   years. 
  The fair value of the purchase rights issued to employees under the stock purchase plan is estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions for purchase rights granted. An expected life of   3   months was used to calculate the fair value.

Note 16 Income Taxes (Restated) 
  The Company recognized a tax benefit of   $13 million   and   $33 million   for the three months ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015, respectively. The Company s effective tax rates were   33.3%   and   56.5%   as of April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015, respectively. The Company s effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to foreign sourced income mix and non-taxable interest income. The change in the effective tax rates is due to restructuring of legal entities that led to a change in the foreign income mix year over year, new U.S. income inclusions, and unbenefited losses in foreign jurisdictions.   

Note 17 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Unrealized (loss) gain on anticipated sales hedging transactions   relate to derivative instruments used to hedge the exposure related to currency exchange rates for forecasted Euro sales. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and the Company defers income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transaction occurs. See Note 10 Derivative Instruments. 
                
    Unrealized (loss) gain on forward interest rate swaps hedging transactions   refer to the hedging of the interest rate risk exposure associated with the variable rate commitment entered into for the Acquisition. See Note 10 Derivative Instruments for more details. 
                
    Foreign currency translation adjustment   relates to the Company's non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates. This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income. 
     The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCI") for the 3 months ended April 2, 2016 and April 4, 2015 are as follows (in millions):

     Table of Contents  

Zebra financed the Acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings of $3.25 billion (the  Indebtedness ), including the sale of 7.25% senior notes due 2022 with an aggregate principal amount of $1.05 billion and a new credit agreement with various lenders that provided a term loan of $2.20 billion due 2021. The new credit agreement also included a $250 million revolving credit facility. 
    
  Segments 
  The Company s operations consist of 2 reportable segments: Legacy Zebra and Enterprise.  
    
  Legacy Zebra 
  The Legacy Zebra segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. Its major product lines include barcode and card printers, location solutions, supplies, and services. Industries served include retail, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: North America; Latin America; Asia-Pacific; and Europe, Middle East, and Africa.  
    
  Enterprise 
  The Enterprise segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. Its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, RFID, WLAN, and services. Industries served include retail, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: North America; Latin America; Asia-Pacific; and Europe, Middle East, and Africa. 
    
  Geographic Information.   For the three months ended April 2, 2016, the Company recorded $849 million of net sales in its consolidated statements of operations, of which approximately 48.9% were attributable to North America; approximately 32.3% were attributable to Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"); and other foreign locations accounted for the remaining 18.8%. 

Results of Operations: Three months ended April 2, 2016 versus three months ended April 4, 2015 
    
  All of the financial information presented in this Item 2 has been revised to reflect the restatement more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Consolidated Results of Operations   (  in millions, except percentages): 

Net sales by product category were as follows   (  in millions, except percentages):

The Company s non-operating income and expense items are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): 

Income Taxes   (in millions, except percentages): 

First quarter 2016 compared to first quarter 2015 
    
  The decline in sales as compared to the prior year quarter was primarily a result of lower hardware sales in the North America, EMEA and Latin America regions, offset partially by higher hardware sales in Asia-Pacific. The decline in hardware sales was primarily due to lower sales volume of data capture and barcode printer products and location solutions. Sales in Latin America continue to be adversely impacted by a weak macro-economic environment. On a constant currency basis, net sales declined approximately 3% as compared to the prior year quarter driven by increases of approximately 1% and 10% in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, respectively, being more than offset by declines in Latin America and North America.  

29 

     Table of Contents  

Gross margin was 45.9% in the first quarter of 2016, relatively flat to a year ago. This reflects an increase in the Legacy Zebra segment gross margin, due largely to improvements in direct costs of sales of supplies, and lower services cost, offset by a decline in the Enterprise segment gross margin, due primarily to changes in product mix, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes. 
    
  Operating expenses for the quarter ended April 2, 2016 were $380 million, or 44.8% of net sales, compared to $389 million, or 43.6% of net sales, in the prior year. Acquisition and integration costs increased as compared to the prior year quarter resulting from the on-going implementation of the Company s IT transition which includes sunsetting the transition services agreement with Motorola Solutions. The increase in general and administrative costs is primarily due to higher depreciation expense related to the Company s investment in its IT infrastructure and higher legal costs. Amortization of intangibles declined due to the final adjustments made to the fair value of intangibles related to the Acquisition made in 2014. Selling and marketing expenses were lower in the current quarter as compared to the prior year due to the effects of staff reductions implemented in 2015. In addition, operating expenses in the current quarter reflected a lower provision for the Company's annual short-term incentive plan associated with the first quarter financial performance.  
    
  Operating income for the quarter ended April 2, 2016 decreased $10 million as compared to the prior year, driven by the drop in profit mainly due to the sales decline. 
    
  Since the end of the first quarter of 2015, the Company has expanded its balance sheet hedging program to incorporate non-US dollar assets and liabilities associated with the Enterprise segment. This is expected to result in less volatility in the Company s operating results due to changes in foreign currency. 
    
  The change in the Company s effective tax rates is due to restructuring of legal entities that led to a change in the foreign income mix year over year, new U.S. income inclusions, and unbenefited losses in foreign jurisdictions. 
    
  Results of Operations by Segment 
  The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in Note 18 Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The segment results exclude purchase accounting adjustments, amortization, acquisition and integration costs, and exit and restructuring costs. 
  Legacy Zebra 
  (in millions as adjusted as described above, except percentages): 

The net sales decline compared to the prior year quarter on a constant currency basis was approximately 3%. This reflects a decline in net sales for the North America and Latin America regions offset partially by higher net sales in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. The overall sales decline was primarily due to lower sales volume of tabletop and desktop printers and location solutions. This was offset partially by a higher volume of sales of mobile printers, supplies, and services. Regionally, the decrease in net sales in North America was primarily due to lower volume of sales related to location solutions. Lower net sales in Latin America reflected lower volumes of tabletop and desktop printers.  
  The increase in gross margin was due primarily to the favorable impact of manufacturing cost improvements in supplies, lower services costs and lower hardware overhead costs offset partially by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes. 
  Operating income for the quarter ended April 2, 2016, decreased 7.8% primarily as a result of lower sales. 
  Enterprise 
  (in millions as adjusted as described above, except percentages): 
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

The net sales decline compared to the prior year quarter on a constant currency basis was approximately 4%. This reflects a decline in net sales in the North America and Latin America regions offset partially by higher net sales in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. The overall sales decline was primarily driven by lower sales volume of data capture products, the majority of which is attributable to a large customer order fulfilled in the first quarter 2015 which did not recur in 2016 and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes. Regionally, the decrease in net sales in North America was primarily due to lower volume of sales of data capture products offset partially by higher mobile computing sales. Lower net sales in Latin America reflected lower volumes of sales of mobile computing products.  
  The decline in gross margin was due primarily to changes in product mix, including the impact of lower sales of data capture products and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes, offset partially by increased margin on services sales. 
  Operating income for the quarter ended April 2, 2016, decreased 22.2% primarily as a result of lower sales. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of April 2, 2016, the Company had cash of $194 million and long-term debt totaling $2.9 billion and did not have any borrowings against its revolving credit facility with $247 million available ($250 million less $3 million of letters of credit). See Note 12 Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The primary factors that influence liquidity include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of revenues, cash collections from customers and capital expenditures. The Company believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and to service its indebtedness. The following table summarizes the Company s cash flow activities for the periods indicated (in millions, except for percentages): 

The change in the Company s cash and cash equivalents balance as of April 2, 2016 is reflective of the following: 
    
  The increase in cash flows from operations consisted of an increase in cash inflows related to accounts receivable, inventory, other assets and accounts payable of $136 million due to lower sales, working capital requirements and a change in payment terms with some of the Company's suppliers. Offsetting the increase was a $83 million increase in cash outflows primarily a result of reduced accrued liabilities related to employee compensation and customer reserves, and higher levels of estimated income tax payments made in 2016.     
    
  Net cash used in investing activities during 2016 included capital expenditures of $19 million in 2016 compared to $26 million in 2015. The $7 million variance year over year is primarily due to investments in IT infrastructure, software applications and tooling equipment in 2016 versus the investments made in the Company's corporate office in 2015. Net cash used for investing activities during the first quarter of 2015 also included $49 million paid to MSI, offset in part by proceeds from sales of marketable securities and investments of $25 million and $2 million, respectively. 
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

Net cash used in financing activities during 2016 consisted primarily of principal repayments of $80 million under the Term Loan compared to $50 million during the first quarter of 2015. These were offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchase plan purchases and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $3 million during 2016 compared to $10 million during the first quarter of 2015. 
    
  Effect of exchange rates on cash 
  Certain assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet are denominated in foreign currency and, as such, include the effects of foreign currency translation. 
  The following table shows the Company s level of indebtedness and other information as of April 2, 2016 (in millions): 

Private Offering 
  On October 15, 2014, the Company completed a private offering of $1.05 billion aggregate principal of 7.25% Senior Notes due October 15, 2022 (the  Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes yielded an effective interest rate of 7.61% at issuance. The Senior Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture, dated as of October 15, 2014, by and among the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year. 
  The Indenture covering the Senior Notes contains certain restrictive and affirmative covenants. In addition, the Senior Notes are guaranteed jointly and severally, on a senior and unsecured basis, by the Company s direct and indirect wholly-owned existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. 
    
  Credit Facilities 
  On October 27, 2014, the Company entered into a new credit agreement which provides for a term loan of $2.2 billion ( Term Loan ) and a revolving credit facility of $250.0 million ( Revolving Credit Facility ). Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin, subject to an all-in floor of   4.75%  . As of April 2, 2016, the Term Loan interest rate was   4.75%  . Interest payments are payable quarterly. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its long-term debt. See Note 10 Derivative Instruments. 
  The credit agreement requires the Company to prepay the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, under certain circumstances or transactions defined in the credit agreement. Also, the Company may make optional prepayments of the Term Loan, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The Company made such optional principal prepayments of   $235 million   in 2016. Unless satisfied by further optional prepayments, the Company is required to make a final scheduled principal payment of   $1.96 billion   due on October 27, 2021. 
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of April 2, 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility interest rate was   3.25%  . Interest payments are payable quarterly. As of April 2, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any borrowings against the Revolving Credit Facility. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility contains various restrictive and affirmative covenants and is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets as defined in the security agreement and guaranteed by its direct and indirect wholly-owned existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The Company is in compliance with the covenants as of April 2, 2016. 
  Certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the  Guarantor Subsidiaries ) guarantee the Senior Notes, the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility on a senior basis. For the 3 months ended April 2, 2016, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would have (a) accounted for approximately 44% of the Company s total revenue and (b) held approximately 25% or $1.3 billion of its total assets and approximately 12%, or $476 million of its total liabilities including trade payables but excluding intercompany liabilities.

The Company had   $143 million   as of April 2, 2016, and   $220 million   as of April 4, 2015 of foreign cash and investments. 

Significant Customers 
  The net sales to significant customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows: 

No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total net sales during these periods. The customers disclosed above are distributors (i.e. not end users) of the Company s products.  
  There are three customers at April 2, 2016 that each accounted for more than   10%   of outstanding accounts receivable. The largest customers accounted for   24.3%  ,   13.5%  , and   11.9%   of outstanding accounts receivable.

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of April 2, 2016. Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of April 2, 2016, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective, due to the identification of a material weakness.  
  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in the internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  
  As of the first quarter of 2015, the Company identified a material weakness related to the process to prepare and review its quarterly and annual income tax provision. The material weakness relates to deficiencies in the design and operation of controls in response to the increased complexity in the legal entity structure of the business following the Enterprise acquisition. These deficiencies impacted our ability to accurately forecast pretax income and deferred taxes, by legal entity, in a timely manner.   
  This material weakness has in part resulted in a restatement of the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the quarterly financial statements for the quarter ended April 2, 2016.  
    
  Remediation Plan 
  Management and the Board of Directors are committed to the continued improvement of the Company s overall system of internal controls over financial reporting. With the identification of the material weakness associated with the preparation and review process of our quarterly and annual tax provision in 2015, we began implementing a remediation plan to address these issues. This plan includes the implementation of improved and documented processes and procedures, as well as hiring additional accounting and tax professionals. We believe our actions will be effective in remediating the material weakness, but only after the applicable processes and procedures have been in place for a sufficient period of time is management able to conclude through testing that these controls are effective. Because some of the controls are executed only at year-end, we cannot evaluate them for effectiveness until the related processes and procedures are completed and tested. 
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  
  During the quarter covered by this report and other than as described above, there have been no other changes in the internal controls that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal controls over financial reporting. 
  Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
