   Forward-looking statements     
     
  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, projections, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are not statements of historical facts. Forward looking statements may be identified by the use of words like  expect,   anticipate,   intend,   forecast,   outlook,   will,   may,   might,   potential,   likely,   target,   plan,   contemplate,   seek,   attempt,   should,   could,   would  or expressions of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements reflect management s good faith evaluation of information currently available and are based on its current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Specific factors that may impact performance or other predictions of future actions have, in many but not all cases, been identified in connection with specific forward-looking statements. TRAC Intermodal LLC s (the  Company,   we  or  TRAC ) actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements.  
     
  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions and the following:

All of the above factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and may be beyond the Company s control. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors or to assess the effect of each such new factor on its business. Except to fulfill the Company s obligations under the U.S. securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made.  
     
  Although the Company believes that assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore any of these statements included herein may prove to be inaccurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or objectives and plans will be achieved.

   1.  Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation   
     
  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of TRAC Intermodal LLC (the  Company,   we,   our  or  TRAC ) and its subsidiaries are unaudited and have been prepared pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for interim financial reporting and, in our opinion, reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring items, which are necessary to present fairly the results for interim periods.  Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC; however, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  These interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and with the information contained in other publicly-available filings with the SEC.  
     
  TRAC is an intermodal chassis solutions provider for domestic and international transportation companies in North America.  Its principal business is providing marine and domestic chassis on both long and short-term leases or rental agreements to a diversified customer base including the world s leading shipping lines, Class I railroads, major U.S. intermodal transportation companies and motor carriers. The Company and its subsidiaries conduct business principally in one industry, the leasing of intermodal transportation equipment. The Company has two reportable segments, the Marine Market segment and the Domestic Market segment. The Company purchases equipment directly from manufacturers and shipping lines as well as through lease agreements, some of which qualify as capital leases. Primarily all of the Company s revenues and long-lived assets are attributable to the United States.  
     
  TRAC is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on July 12, 2012 to facilitate the issuance of $300,000 aggregate principal amount of 11% Senior Secured Notes (the  Notes ).  The Company conducts its business through its 100% owned subsidiary, Interpool, Inc. ( Interpool ) and its consolidated subsidiaries.   TRAC is ultimately owned by Seacastle Inc. ( Seacastle ). Seacastle is owned by private equity funds that are managed by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC ( Fortress ) and by employees of affiliates of Seacastle. Interpool was founded in 1968 as an operating lessor servicing the intermodal transportation equipment industry. Interpool was listed on The New York Stock Exchange as a public company in 1993 and was acquired and taken private by Seacastle in July 2007.

   Interstar Acquisition   
     
  On February 29, 2016, TRAC Interstar LLC ( TRAC Interstar ), a newly formed, indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the emergency road service business of Interstar Mobile, LLC and Interstar North America, Inc. (collectively  Interstar ) for a purchase price of $5,943 which includes a $1,000 earn-out provision based on future operating performance.  The Company recorded $4,908 of goodwill related to the acquisition.  The allocation of the purchase price accounting is preliminary as the Company has not yet completed its analysis of estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.  Interstar, located in Kentucky, is a leading provider of road service repair solutions for both the intermodal and commercial trucking industries.  The new entity, TRAC Interstar, combines a dispatch center and one of the country s largest managed vendor networks and will provide roadside repair services covering chassis, truck and trailer breakdowns 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  
     
   New Accounting Standards   
     
   Pending Adoption   
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  ( ASU 2014-09 ). This update supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements.  The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. New disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers are also required. This guidance was effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early application was not permitted. However on July 9, 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date by one year. The deferral results in the new revenue standard being effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The FASB also decided to allow early adoption but no earlier than the original effective date of December 15, 2016.  Entities must adopt the new guidance using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for  Leases (Topic 842):  ( ASU 2016-02 ).  The FASB is issuing this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Entities are required to adopt this guidance using a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   1.  Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation (continued)   
     
   In March 2016, the  FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting:  ( ASU 2016-09 ).  The amendments in this Update affect all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The standard also allows entities to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on the cash flow statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur.   The amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
     
  In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments : ( ASU 2016-15 ). The standard provides guidance on eight specific cash flow items and their classifications in the statement of cash flows thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
  No other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during 2016 had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
     
   2. Leasing Activity   
     
   Equipment Leasing Revenue   
     
  The Company has non-cancelable operating leases for certain of its leasing equipment. At September 30, 2016, future minimum lease revenue under these agreements is estimated as follows:

   2. Leasing Activity (continued)   
     
   Finance Revenue   
     
  At September 30, 2016, receivables under direct finance leases are collectible through 2022 as follows:  

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had total lease receivables, unearned lease income and net lease receivables of $14,330, $1,533 and $12,797, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had guaranteed and unguaranteed residual values for leasing equipment on direct finance leases of $8,656 and $8,673, respectively.  The unguaranteed residual values are reflected in  Total Lease Receivables  above.  
     
  Historically, the Company has not experienced losses related to direct finance leases and does not project future uncollectible amounts related to the principal balances receivable. If customers were to default, the Company would seek to recover the equipment securing the lease, often at fair market values in excess of the remaining receivable.  
     
   3. Leasing Equipment   
     
  The following is a summary of leasing equipment recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:  

Leasing equipment includes assets recorded under capital leases of $82,195 and $121,817 with accumulated depreciation of $31,730 and $46,304 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

   3. Leasing Equipment (continued)   
     
   Impairment of Leasing Equipment   
     
  Impairment of leasing equipment amounted to $2,007 and $9,980 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  This compares to $1,693 and $5,695 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  The increase in impairment charges reflected during 2016 was primarily due to a greater number of end-of-life chassis impaired in 2016 versus 2015 and an increase in write-downs associated with axle sets determined to be unsuitable for the remanufacturing program.  The above impairment charges are recorded in Impairment of leasing equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
     
   4. Capitalized Software Development Costs   
     
  In 2014, the Company s Investment Committee approved the proposal to replace its principal operating and financial reporting systems, named  Project Helix  to provide more functional capabilities necessitated by new business requirements emerging from the industry shift to the motor carrier model.  In accordance with ASC 350-40,  Internal-Use Software , the Company is capitalizing costs during the application development stage of the project.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, capitalized software development costs totaled $20,461 and $9,675, respectively.  These costs are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Once the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, capitalization will cease.  Capitalized software costs will be amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years, the estimated useful life of the software.  
     
   5. Borrowings

   5. Borrowings (continued)   
     
  The Company s debt consisted of notes, loans and capital lease obligations payable in varying amounts through 2021.  On a consolidated basis, the weighted-average interest rate was 5.37% for the year ended December 31, 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted-average interest rate was 4.20% and 5.58%, respectively.  The weighted-average interest rates disclosed are calculated as  all-in  rates which include cash interest expense and amortization of agents  fees and deferred financing fees.  
     
  On January 14, 2016, the Company borrowed $51,000 (the  Repurchase Amount ) under the revolving credit facility of the ABL Facility to finance the repurchase and retirement of 62 shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the common stock of Interpool held by the Company, the sole stockholder of Interpool  Through a successive chain of dividends, the Repurchase Amount was received pro rata by the Company s indirect shareholders of record, including certain private equity funds that are managed by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC, employees of affiliates of Seacastle Inc. (the Company s indirect parent) and members of the Company s management.  
     
  In February 2016, the Company executed three interest rate swap agreements to convert variable rate debt based on LIBOR into a fixed rate per annum.  See Note 6.  
     
  On March 7, 2016, the Company announced its proposed offering of $485,000 aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2021. Subsequently on March 22, 2016, the Company decided that due to current market conditions, it would not proceed with its proposed offering.  As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expensed approximately $1,603 of accumulated costs related to the offering. These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
     
   Redemption of Senior Secured 11% Notes   
     
  On August 15, 2016, the Company borrowed $80,000 under its ABL Facility which carries an interest rate of one-month LIBOR + 2.00% and matures on December 10, 2020, which is the maturity date of the ABL Facility.  The funds were used to finance the redemption of $80,000 in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Senior Secured 11% Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.500 percent of such aggregate principal amount.  Approximately $84,400 was paid to redeem the Notes, $80,000 aggregate principal amount and a premium of $4,400.  Additionally, $1,206 of deferred financing fees related to the Notes were expensed upon redemption.  As of September 30, 2016, $70,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding.

   6. Derivatives and Hedging Activities   
     
  In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes interest rate derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risks. Through the utilization of interest rate derivatives, the Company receives floating rate payments in exchange for fixed rate payments, effectively converting its floating rate debt to a fixed rate.  If certain conditions are met, an interest rate derivative may be specifically designated as a cash flow hedge. The Company s interest rate derivatives qualify and have been designated as cash flow hedges.  For the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss, changes in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the interest payments on the debt are recorded in earnings.  The ineffective portion of the derivative gain or loss is recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
     
  On January 10, 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction with Deutsche Bank AG effectively converting $300,000 of variable rate debt based upon LIBOR into a fixed rate instrument.  The Company receives one-month LIBOR with interest payable at a rate of 0.756% on the notional amount.  At September 30, 2016, one-month LIBOR was 0.5311%.  The agreement terminates on August 9, 2017.  
     
  On February 4, 2016, the Company executed two interest rate swap agreements with Deutsche Bank.  One agreement effectively converts $50,000 of variable rate debt based upon LIBOR into a fixed rate of 1.063% per annum.  This agreement will terminate on December 10, 2020 at the same time the Company s ABL Facility terminates.  Additionally, the Company executed a $300,000 forward interest rate swap agreement.  This agreement begins on August 9, 2017 when the Company s existing $300,000 swap agreement ends.  At that time, the Company will effectively convert $300,000 of variable rate debt based upon LIBOR into a fixed rate of 1.2985%.  
     
  On February 5, 2016, the Company executed an interest rate swap with PNC Bank effectively converting $100,000 of variable rate debt based upon LIBOR into a fixed rate of 1.1175%.  The agreement will terminate December 10, 2020 at the same time the Company s ABL Facility terminates.

   7. Commitments and Contingencies   
     
   Chassis Purchase Commitments   
     
  The Company s chassis purchase commitments are related to commitments to refurbish chassis, remanufacture chassis and to exercise purchase options related to maturing capital leases.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had non-cancellable commitments totaling approximately $33,860 with commitments totaling $16,806, $8,565, $6,563 and $1,926 for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a purchase order for the refurbishment of chassis which allows either party to cancel with 90 days  notice.  If the Company were to cancel, it would be required to fulfill refurbishments committed aggregating approximately $3,355 which is included in the 2016 commitment number above.  
     
   Tire Purchase Commitments   
     
  Contemporaneous with the Interstar acquisition, the Company committed to purchase from an affiliate of the acquired company 45,000 tires annually for a period of five years.  Initial prices for tire types were agreed upon but are subject to purchase price adjustments based on certain changes in the cost of raw materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the mix of tires to be purchased over the commitment period.  At September 30, 2016, the tire purchase commitments are estimated to be $24,292 with $1,783 committed for the remainder of 2016, $5,919 committed for 2017 and $5,530 committed for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. See Note 12.  
     
   Lease Commitments   
     
  The Company is party to various operating leases relating to office facilities and certain other equipment with various expiration dates through 2026. All leasing arrangements contain normal leasing terms without unusual purchase options or escalation clauses.  As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate minimum rental commitment under operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year was $43,467.  
     
   Stock Buyback Program   
     
  On April 13, 2016, Interpool instituted a stock buyback program (the  Stock Buyback Program ) whereby employees who hold vested shares of SCT Chassis, Inc. ( SCT Chassis ), an indirect parent of the Company, pursuant to Management Shareholder Agreements executed prior to January 1, 2016, will be eligible to elect, on an annual basis, to sell up to 25% of such shares to Interpool.  Under the Stock Buyback Program, participants will elect annually whether to participate in the Stock Buyback Program and the number of eligible shares they wish to sell.  Elections will generally be made on or about April 30 of each year, and the Stock Buyback Program will expire in 2019 after all completed share repurchase elections are fulfilled for that year.  The fair market value price, at which SCT Chassis shares will be repurchased, will be determined each year by the Board of Directors of SCT Chassis.  At September 30, 2016, the estimated repurchase amount based on the current fair market value of $10.72 per share is $3,294.  See Note 10.

   7. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)   
     
   ILWU Roadability Program   Inspection Fees   
     
   An  agreement reached in March 2015 between the Pacific Maritime Association ( PMA ) and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union ( ILWU ) provides for mandatory roadability inspections (subject to limited exceptions) of all chassis before they leave any of the West Coast terminals where the ILWU has jurisdiction (the  ILWU Roadability Program ).  In connection with this program, the Company has received invoices and payment demands from certain host locations. The Company is  currently disputing such fees because, among other reasons, it believes there is no legal basis for them to be imposed and the ILWU Roadability Program provides for inspections beyond those required by applicable law.  Since the Company believes that any amounts it may be required to pay are not probable, it is not currently accruing such expenses in its financial statements.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company has received invoices aggregating approximately $5,000.  
     
   8.  Income Taxes   
     
  The consolidated income tax provisions for the three and nine months ended September, 30, 2016 and 2015 were determined based upon estimates of the Company s consolidated forecasted effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a tax provision of $1,666, reflecting a 32.6% effective tax rate.  This compares to a tax provision of $737, on a net loss of $501, reflecting a 147% effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  In both periods, the effective tax rate was adversely impacted by Canadian and Mexican tax provisions.  In addition, the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by a lower state effective tax rate and the recognition of a Research and Development tax credit on the Project Helix costs.  The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was adversely affected due to discreet items recorded pertaining to changes in certain states  effective tax rates.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a tax provision of $7,149, reflecting a 38.0% effective tax rate.  This compares to a tax provision of $13,171, reflecting a 41.4% effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In both periods, the effective tax rate was adversely impacted by Canadian and Mexican tax provisions.  In addition, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by a lower state effective tax rate and the recognition of a Research and Development tax credit on the Project Helix costs.

Additionally on June 1, 2016, the Company advised the employee that he would be permitted to participate in the Stock Buyback Program (as defined below) instituted by the Company in April 2016.  See description of program following.  
     
   Stock Buyback Program   
     
  On April 13, 2016, Interpool instituted a stock buyback program (the  Stock Buyback Program ) whereby employees who hold vested shares of SCT Chassis, an indirect parent of the Company, pursuant to Management Shareholder Agreements executed prior to January 1, 2016, will be eligible to elect, on an annual basis, to sell up to 25% of such shares to Interpool.  Under the Stock Buyback Program, participants will elect annually whether to participate in the Stock Buyback Program and the number of eligible shares they wish to sell.  Elections will generally be made on or about April 30 of each year, and the Stock Buyback Program will expire in 2019 after all completed share repurchase elections are fulfilled for that year.  The fair market value price, at which SCT Chassis shares will be repurchased, will be determined each year by the Board of Directors of SCT Chassis.  For the 2016 repurchase, Interpool offered a purchase price of $11.21 per share, and such offer expired on May 13, 2016.

   10. Share-Based Payment (continued)   
     
  The Company accounted for the repurchase feature which provides for a cash settlement option for eligible shares in accordance with the  Compensation   Stock Compensation  Topic of the FASB ASC.  Provisions of the Program require certain equity awards to be accounted for under liability accounting; hence such awards have been reclassified and will be re-measured at each reporting date.  The Company recognized $312 of additional compensation expense with regard to these awards due to the Program modification and reclassified $641 from Member s interest to a share repurchase liability account.  At inception the Share repurchase liability was $953 and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Additionally, the guidance in  Accounting Series Release No. 268  ( ASR 268 ) requires equity awards, which are now redeemable under the Program to be classified as temporary equity on the balance sheet and re-measured to the estimated redemption value at each reporting period.  The Company recognized $744 of additional compensation expense due to the Program modification and reclassified $1,859 from Member s interest to Redeemable indirect parent shares held by management associated with such awards.  Additionally, $775 was recorded to Redeemable indirect parent shares held by management with the offset to Member s interest to reflect the estimated redemption value for these shares.  At inception the balance in this account was $3,378.  
     
  On May 13, 2016, the Company repurchased 94,527 shares for $1,060 in accordance with the Stock Buyback Program discussed above.  Accordingly, the Company reduced Redeemable indirect parent shares held by management by $845 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and also reduced the Share repurchase liability by $215.  
     
  At September 30, 2016, the Share repurchase liability was $871 and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Additionally, the balance in Redeemable indirect parent shares held by management was $2,423 and is presented as temporary equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Both accounts were revalued to fair value and estimated redemption value, respectively, at September 30, 2016.  
     
  The Company recorded share-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $95 and $1,264, respectively which includes the amounts discussed above.  This compares to compensation expense of $117 and $466 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Compensation expense is recorded as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and is recognized on a straight-line basis with the compensation expense recognized as of any date being at least equal to the portion of the grant-date fair value that is vested at that date. Total unrecognized compensation expense was approximately $658 at September 30, 2016, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.4 years.

   Share Repurchases   
     
  In addition to the share repurchase discussed above under the Stock Buyback Program, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Interpool purchased 32,547 shares of SCT Chassis common stock from employees to meet their minimum statutory withholding requirements upon share vesting and to repurchase shares from an employee upon termination.  The cost of these shares was $306 and is included in Member s interest in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
     
   11. Segment and Geographic Information   
     
  The Company s principal business is providing marine and domestic chassis on both long and short-term leases or rental agreements to a diversified customer base including the world s leading shipping lines, Class I railroads, major U.S. intermodal transportation companies and motor carriers. The Company provides such services to its customers through two operating and reportable segments, the Marine Market segment and the Domestic Market segment. The reportable segments are based on the chassis markets that are served by the Company.  
     
  The Company evaluates current and future projected segment performance and allocates resources to them primarily based upon Adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment of assets and leasing equipment, loss on modification and extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, other expense (income), interest income,  share-based compensation, principal collections on direct finance leases and other non-routine or non-cash items as determined by management. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure recognized under U.S. GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA helps management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help the Company meet its current financial goals and optimize its financial performance. Accordingly, the Company believes this metric measures its financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely the cost structure and expenses of the organization.

   Management, Facility Fees and Chassis Leasing   
     
  The Company charges management fees to a subsidiary of Seacastle for expenses incurred and services performed on its behalf.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, this resulted in income for the Company of $23 and $67, respectively.  This compares to $31 and $93, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  These amounts are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had a net payable to affiliates of $22 at September 30, 2016 compared to a net receivable from affiliates of $584 at December 31, 2015.

  The Company also leases chassis to the Florida East Coast Railway ( FEC ) under term lease and pool arrangements. The parent company to the FEC is Florida East Coast Industries, Inc., which is owned by private equity funds managed by affiliates of Fortress. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded chassis leasing revenue from FEC of $591 and $1,702, respectively.  This compares to chassis leasing revenue of $589 and $1,662, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  These amounts are recorded in Equipment leasing revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
     
  The Company is committed to purchasing 45,000 tires annually for a period of five years from a tire supplier that is co-owned by a member of the senior management team at TRAC Interstar.  At September 30, 2016, the tire purchase commitments are estimated to be $24,292 with $1,783 committed for 2016, $5,919 committed for 2017 and $5,530 committed for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.  See Note 7.  
     
   13.  Restructuring Charge   
     
  During June 2016, in response to changing market conditions, the Company initiated a reduction in certain staffing levels.  In accordance with the  Compensation   Non-Retirement Post-Employment Benefits  Topic of the FASB ASC, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $1,404 related to employee severance and termination benefits.  This charge is recorded in Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  At September 30, 2016, the balance in Accrued restructuring is $364 which is included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The decrease in the liability balance from $1,404 at June 30, 2016 to $364 at September 30, 2016 is due entirely to payments made.  
     
   14.  Grow New Jersey Tax Credit   
     
  On June 10, 2014, the Company was approved to receive a Grow NJ Tax Credit in the amount not to exceed $9,800 subject to the terms and conditions of the Grow New Jersey Assistance Act, P.L. 2011, c. 149, as amended; the Grow NJ Program regulations, N.J.A.C. 19:31-18.1 et seq. subject to final amendments to the regulations; and the terms and conditions set forth in the Approval Letter and in the Incentive Agreement.  
     
  During 2015, the Company satisfied all the terms and conditions necessary to obtain the Grow NJ Tax Credit and in January 2016, the New Jersey Division of Taxation approved and issued the overall tax credit certificate for $8,800.  Since the grant is payable in yearly increments over a ten year period commencing in 2016, the year the first tax credit certificate is issued, the Company received credits amounting to $880 during the first quarter of 2016. It is anticipated that upon continued compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant, the Company will receive an annual grant of $880 each year from 2017 to 2025.  
     
  Additionally, as provided for in the statutes governing the grant, the Company sold the tax credits it received to a third party.  The third party agreed to purchase, over the ten year period, all credits not used by the Company at 92.5% of the face value of the credits.  On February 25, 2016, the third party purchased tax credits totaling $880 and paid the Company $814.  There was also a $4 transfer fee related to this transaction.

  Based on the above transaction, the Company recognized Grant income of $136 and $403 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  This is recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  At September 30, 2016, the amount in deferred income was $407 which is recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  
     
   15. Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
     
  The following table sets forth the valuation of the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the input levels (as defined) at the dates indicated:  

Cash and cash equivalents:    Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments. These instruments are stated at cost, which approximates market value because of the short-term nature of the instruments.

   15. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)   
     
   Derivative instruments:    The Company s interest rate derivatives were recorded at fair value on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets and consist of United States dollar denominated LIBOR-based interest rate swaps. Their fair values were determined using cash flows discounted at relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close. The fair value generally reflected the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to transfer the contracts at the reporting date and therefore reflected the Company s or counterparty s non-performance risk. Additionally, the Company has analyzed each of the redemption features included in the notes to determine whether any of these embedded features should be bifurcated in accordance with the  Derivatives and Hedging  Topic of the FASB ASC (ASC 815). The Company has concluded that the redemption feature which offers optional redemption by the Company of up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price of 111% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes using the cash proceeds of an equity offering qualifies as a feature that should be bifurcated under ASC 815. The Company has determined that the resulting measurement of the fair value of this embedded derivative is immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and will continue to reassess the fair value of this derivative prospectively with any changes recorded in earnings. 
     
   Share repurchase liability and Redeemable indirect parent shares held by management:    The Share repurchase liability account and the Redeemable indirect parent shares held by management were recorded at fair value and estimated redemption value on the Company s Balance Sheet.  The fair value and estimated redemption value of these shares at September 30, 2016 was determined to be $10.72 per share.  The value per share was determined by a valuation by the Board of Directors of SCT Chassis.  In determining fair market value, the Board of Directors relies on a number of valuation approaches including the market-based approach using current market multiples as well as the income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. 
     
  Leasing equipment that is deemed to be impaired is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The fair value is calculated using the income approach based on inputs classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  
     
  The Company believes the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximates the fair value of these financial instruments because of their short-term nature.

   Debt:    The Company s debt consists of fixed and floating rate instruments. Variable interest rate debt was $559,142 as of September 30, 2016 and $584,401 as of December 31, 2015.  Accordingly, the Company s variable rate debt approximates market value for similar instruments at the respective dates. The Company had fixed rate debt of $547,709 as of September 30, 2016 and $496,278 as of December 31, 2015.  Fair value was calculated based on inputs classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
     
  The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows:  

16. Guarantor Financial Information   
     
  On August 9, 2012, TRAC Intermodal LLC along with TRAC Intermodal Corp., entered into a purchase agreement pursuant to which it sold $300,000 aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured 11% Notes (the  Notes ). Concurrent with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with investors which required the Company to file a registration statement with the SEC to offer exchange notes with terms substantially identical to the Notes. The exchange offer to exchange the Notes for notes which have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), commenced on June 6, 2013, expired on July 5, 2013 and closed on July 10, 2013.  Based on information provided by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the exchange agent for the exchange offer, as of the expiration date 100% of the Notes were validly tendered for exchange.   The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed unconditionally on a senior secured basis by all of the Company s existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. All guarantor subsidiaries are 100% owned by the Company.  On August 17, 2015, the Issuers redeemed $150,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes.  Additionally on August 15, 2016, the Issuer redeemed $80,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes.  As of September 30, 2016, $70,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding.

   17.      Subsequent Event  
     
   Restricted Stock Unit Plan   
     
  On October 28, 2016, the SCT Chassis board of directors ratified, confirmed, authorized and approved the terms of the SCT Chassis Restricted Stock Unit Plan dated as of October 1, 2016 (the  RSU Plan ), the form of Restricted Stock Unit Award and Management Shareholder Agreement (the  RSU MSA ) and the list of participants in the Plan that would receive RSU MSAs in 2016.  The RSU Plan provides for annual grants of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ) to participating employees upon the Company s achievement of targeted levels of Adjusted Earnings before Tax ( Adjusted EBT ).  Adjusted EBT targets are determined each year during the budget process. The number of shares to be granted is based upon levels of Adjusted EBT attained, the grade level of each participant and the fair value of SCT Chassis Stock at the grant date.  
     
  On October 28, 2016, in accordance with the RSU Plan, a total of 168,577 RSUs were granted to certain members of Interpool management at a fair value of $8.36 per RSU, or a total fair value of $1,409, for achievement of the Adjusted EBT target for performance year 2015.  The fair market value of the RSUs reflects a 22% lack of marketability discount as the RSU Plan provides no provision for participants to sell their shares to the Company.  These RSUs will vest in one-third increments on January 1, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively with the underlying common stock being delivered to employees no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the RSUs vest.  
     
   Chassis Purchase Options Exercised   
     
  During October and November 2016, the Company exercised four purchase options related to its capital leases, two early purchase options and two from maturing capital leases for an aggregate purchase price of $11,032 and recognized a loss on modification and extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations of $126.  
     
  The Company has evaluated all significant activities through the time of filing these financial statements with the SEC and has concluded that no additional subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosure in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     
     
   The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands of U.S. dollars except per share amounts, or unless otherwise stated. The interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions.  Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the  Forward-looking statements  set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as a result of many factors, including those included and discussed in  Forward-looking statements  and  Risk factors  set forth in Part I-Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and elsewhere in this report.   
     
   Overview   
     
  We believe we are the largest intermodal chassis solutions provider, measured by total assets, for domestic and international transportation companies in North America.  Our principal business is providing marine and domestic chassis on both long and short-term leases or rental agreements to a diversified customer base including the world s leading shipping lines, Class I railroads, major U.S. intermodal transportation companies and motor carriers.  
     
  Our fleet of equipment consists of marine and domestic chassis. These assets are owned, leased-in or managed by us on behalf of third-party owners in pooling arrangements. As of September 30, 2016, we owned, leased-in or managed a fleet of 303,927 chassis and units available for remanufacture. The net book value of our owned equipment was approximately $1.42 billion.  
     
  We operate our business through two operating segments: the Marine Market segment and the Domestic Market segment.  
     
                  Marine Market segment primarily serving shipping lines and motor carriers with 20 , 40  and 45  foot chassis. These chassis are used in the transport of dry or refrigerated marine shipping containers of the same size carrying goods between port terminals and/or railroad ramps and retail or wholesale warehouses or store locations, principally in the United States. We offer customers both long-term leases and short-term leases or rental agreements. As of September 30, 2016, our active fleet included 186,308 marine chassis. 
     
                  Domestic Market segment primarily serving railroads and major U.S. intermodal transportation companies with 53  chassis. These chassis are used in the transport of domestic shipping containers of the same size carrying goods between railroad ramps and retail or wholesale warehouses or store locations, principally in the United States. We offer customers both long-term leases and short-term leases or rental agreements. As of September 30, 2016, our active fleet included 80,414 domestic chassis. 
     
 43   

Table of Contents   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, approximately 16%, 1%, and 83% of our on-hire chassis fleet was leased on term leases, direct finance leases or in chassis pools, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, 22% of our on-hire fleet was under existing agreements that provided for total contractual cash flow of $105.8 million over the remaining life of the contracts assuming no leases are further renewed upon expiration.   Our utilization rates are determined by the percentage of our total fleet that is on-hire divided by the total fleet, excluding chassis awaiting the remanufacture process.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, our utilization rates were 91.8% and 95.9%, respectively. 
     
  The table below summarizes our total fleet by type of lease as of September 30, 2016:  

Term lease products   
     
  Under a term lease, the lessee commits to a fixed lease term, typically between 1 and 5 years .  We retain the benefit and residual value of equipment ownership, and bear the risk of re-leasing the asset upon expiration of the lease.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our term lease renewal rate was approximately 75% with very little movement of assets from term arrangements to pool arrangements during the quarter.

Table of Contents   
     
   Direct finance lease products   
     
  Direct finance lease terms and conditions are similar to those of our term leases, except that, under a direct finance lease, the customer commits to a fixed lease term and typically receives a bargain purchase option at the expiration of the lease. Under this arrangement, the substantive risks and benefits of equipment ownership are transferred to the lessee. The lease payments are segregated into principal and interest components that are similar to a loan. The interest component, calculated using the effective interest method over the term of the lease, is recognized by us as Finance revenue. The principal component of the lease is reflected as a reduction to the net investment in the direct finance lease. The typical initial term on these leases is between 5 and 10 years, with multiple renewals to extend the lease term by another 1 to 3 years.  
     
   Chassis pools   
     
  We operate and maintain domestic and marine chassis pools. A neutral chassis pool is similar to a car rental model in which we provide a shared pool of chassis at major intermodal transportation points such as port terminals and railroad ramps for use by multiple customers on an as-needed basis.  Additionally, we are a contributor to several cooperative pools.  In a cooperative ( co-op ) pool model, several chassis owners contribute chassis into a single pool for users.  Contributors must contribute a number of chassis proportionate to that of their customer usage.  An authorized user of the pool may use any chassis in that pool regardless of the owner/contributor of the chassis.  Costs of the pool are charged back to the contributors in one of several allocation bases, either by total number of chassis contributed or by number of chassis actually used.  Customers generally enter into pool user agreements for a period of one to three years and may be subject to subscription levels for minimum chassis usage. As of September 30, 2016, 15% of chassis pool revenue was generated by such minimum usage arrangements.  Multi-year agreements typically contain annual pricing reset features.  
     
   Marine chassis pools   
     
  We operate pools and contribute chassis in many of the major port terminals and railroad ramps on the Eastern seaboard, Gulf Coast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest and the Pacific Southwest using marine 20 , 40  and 45  chassis.  As of September 30, 2016, we owned 125,668 chassis and managed 9,824 chassis owned or leased and contributed by shipping lines for a total of 135,492 chassis engaged in providing this service. The net book value of our owned marine pool units amounted to $590.3 million as of September 30, 2016.  Marine chassis pool customers pay per diem rates and in some cases are subject to subscription levels for minimum chassis usage that are typically one year in length. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 2% of marine chassis pool revenue was generated under subscription arrangements.

   Domestic chassis pools   
     
  We also operate pools for domestic 53  chassis at railroad ramps throughout the United States. As of September 30, 2016, we had 68,078 chassis, including 7,883 chassis that we lease-in, engaged in providing this service. The net book value of the domestic pool chassis that we own totaled $437.6 million, as of September 30, 2016.  In 2015, we had exclusive arrangements with five of the seven Class I railroads that carry freight in the United States to provide this service at many of their railroad ramps. However, later that same year, we were advised by one of the Class I railroads that they would not renew their contract on an exclusive basis when the agreement terminated in 2016.  We have been in negotiations with this Class I railroad about an alternative non-exclusive agreement with us and we expect to sign this non-exclusive agreement in the fourth quarter of 2016.  In 2016, we were also advised by two more Class I railroads with whom we had exclusive arrangements that they did not wish to renew on an exclusive basis.  We have already signed a new non-exclusive contract with one of these two railroads and while we are in the early stages of negotiations with the second railroad, we expect to ultimately sign a non-exclusive renewal contract with them as well.  With regard to the leasing of these domestic chassis, we have long-term contracts with many of the largest intermodal logistics companies and railroads that operate standard-size domestic intermodal equipment.  Large portions of our domestic chassis are leased under these contracts and under similar contracts with other customers and in some cases are subject to subscription levels for minimum chassis usage that are typically three to five years in length.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 47% of domestic chassis pool revenue was generated under subscription arrangements.  
     
   Other revenue   
     
  Other revenue is derived from three primary sources: maintenance and repair service revenue, repositioning revenue and management services revenue.  
     
   Critical Accounting Policies   
     
  There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Revenues    
     
  Total Company revenue was $170.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $177.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $6.3 million or 4%.  
     
  Equipment leasing revenue was $156.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $170.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $13.1 million or 8%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average on-hire fleet of approximately 17,300 chassis, or 7%, which led to a decrease in equipment leasing revenue of $11.2 million, and a 1% decrease in average per diem rates, which resulted in a decrease in equipment leasing revenue of $1.9 million.  
     
  The overall decrease in average per diem rates was primarily due to lower chassis usage within our marine pools, the impact of which was partially offset by higher per diem rates charged to motor carriers during the quarter and decreases in both the average per diem rates and chassis usage within our domestic pool.

Table of Contents   
     
  Finance revenue was $0.4 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Although finance revenue was $0.4 million in both comparable periods, this was the result of a net reduction in the average investment in direct finance leases of $1.9 million, primarily due to normal amortization through principal payments and maturing lease arrangements, partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate for new direct finance lease arrangements.  
     
  Other revenue was $13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $6.8 million or 101%. This increase was primarily attributable to $5.0 million of emergency roadside repair billings resulting from the February 29, 2016 acquisition of Interstar and a $2.1 million increase in repair billings. These increases were partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in scrap metal proceeds in connection with the disposal of end-of-life chassis and a $0.1 million reduction in billings for the repositioning of equipment.  
     
   Marine Market segment   
     
  Total Marine Market segment revenue was $113.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $127.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $14.1 million or 11%.

   Average Total Fleet is based upon the total fleet at each month end.   
     
  Equipment leasing revenue was $110.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $124.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $13.8 million or 11%. Marine pool per diem revenues decreased $12.7 million or 11%. This decrease was primarily due to a 9% decrease in the average number of chassis in our marine pools and a 3% decrease in the average per diem rates in our marine pools. The decrease in average per diem rates was primarily due to lower chassis usage within our marine pools, the impact of which was partially offset by higher per diem rates charged to motor carriers during the quarter. The net reduction in the number of chassis in our marine pools was primarily due to moving chassis into depot and long-term storage locations in reaction to the decline in demand experienced during the quarter, as well as a reduction in leased-in chassis, also as a result of the decline in demand. Marine pool per diem revenues attributable to motor carriers rose to 64% of total marine pool per diem revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 55% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Marine term lease revenues decreased $1.1 million or 11% due to a 15% decrease in the average number of chassis on-hire, partially offset by  
     
 48   

Table of Contents   
     
  a 4% increase in the average per diem rates. The decrease in the average number of chassis on hire was primarily due to reduced demand experienced during the current year period. The increase in the average per diem rates was primarily due to the expiration of lower rate term leases and incremental term leases at higher per diem rates.  
     
  Finance revenue was $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $0.1 million. This decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in the average investment in direct finance leases of $1.8 million, primarily due to normal amortization through principal payments and maturing lease arrangements.  
     
  Other revenue was $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $0.3 million or 11%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $0.2 million reduction in repair billings.  
     
   Domestic Market segment   
     
  Total Domestic Market segment revenue was $48.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $47.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.6 million or 1%.

   Average Total Fleet is based upon the total fleet at each month end.   
     
  Equipment leasing revenue was $46.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $45.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.7 million or 1%. Domestic pool per diem revenues increased $1.2 million or 3%. This increase was primarily due to a 4% increase in the average number of chassis in our domestic pools, partially offset by a 1% decrease in the average per diem rates in our domestic pool. Domestic term lease revenues decreased $0.5 million or 13% due to a 16% decrease in the average number of chassis on-hire, partially offset by a 3% increase in the average per diem rates.  
     
  Other revenue was $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $0.1 million or 5%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $0.1 million reduction in billings for the repositioning of equipment.

    Direct operating expenses    
     
  Total Company direct operating expenses were $95.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $98.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $3.3 million or 3%. Maintenance and repair expenses within our Marine and Domestic Market Segments decreased $7.9 million or 11%, which was primarily due to a lower average cost per repair, as well as a net decrease in the average number of chassis operating in our marine and domestic chassis pools. The decrease in the average cost per repair within the Marine Market segment was primarily due to reduced maintenance and repair spending in response to the reduced demand experienced during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015, partially offset by a higher frequency of repairs. Maintenance and repair expenses for chassis residing at third party depots and at the Company s service centers decreased $0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015. Partially offsetting these decreases was $3.4 million of incremental maintenance and repair expenses resulting from the February 29, 2016 acquisition of Interstar. Additionally, there was an increase in storage costs of $1.5 million, as well as an increase in pool operational expense and repositioning and handling expenses of $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The increase in pool operational expense was primarily due to facility rental agreements in the Northeast entered into during the fourth quarter of 2015. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in chassis usage fees of $1.3 million. Other direct operating expenses decreased by $0.1 million.  
     
   Marine Market segment   
     
  Direct operating expenses for the Marine Market segment were $68.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $76.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $8.2 million or 11%. Maintenance and repair expenses decreased $9.0 million or 15%, which was primarily due to a lower average cost per repair and a decrease in the average number of chassis operating in our marine chassis pool. The decrease in the average cost per repair was primarily due to reduced maintenance and repair spending in response to the reduced demand experienced during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015, partially offset by a higher frequency of repairs. Additionally, there was a reduction in chassis usage fees of $1.5 million. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in storage costs of $1.5 million and pool operational expense of $0.9 million. Other direct operating expenses decreased by $0.1 million.  
     
   Domestic Market segment   
     
  Direct operating expenses for the Domestic Market segment were $18.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $1.7 million or 10%. Maintenance and repair expenses increased $1.1 million or 10%, which was primarily due to a 4% increase in the average number of chassis operating in our domestic chassis pools and an increase in the average cost per repair partially offset by a lower frequency of repairs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015. Additionally, there was an increase in repositioning and handling expenses of $0.4 million and chassis usage fees of $0.2 million.

  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $21.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $23.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $2.0 million or 8%. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in employee-related expenses resulting from the decline in staffing levels as part of the June 2016 restructuring and a reduction in incentive-based compensation, partially offset by incremental expenses resulting from the Interstar acquisition.  
     
    Depreciation expense    
     
  Depreciation expense was $18.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $18.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.5 million or 3%. This increase was primarily due to incremental depreciation expense resulting from chassis acquired and remanufactured since October 1, 2015. The aforementioned chassis acquisitions were related to marine chassis purchased from the shipping lines and the purchase of previously leased-in domestic chassis to support the growth in the domestic pool.

    Provision (recovery) for doubtful accounts    
     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the provision (recovery) for doubtful accounts increased by $7.5 million versus the comparable period of 2015. This increase was primarily due to a $6.7 million incremental reserve requirement resulting from Hanjin Shipping s August 2016 bankruptcy filing, as well as incremental billings to motor carriers, partially offset by an improved collection experience with our motor carriers.  
     
    Impairment of leasing equipment    
     
  We recorded impairment charges on leasing equipment of $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.3 million. This increase was primarily due to a greater number of end-of-life chassis impaired during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015.  
     
    Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations    
     
  Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations was $5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $16.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $10.5 million. In August 2016, the Company redeemed $80.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 11.0% Senior Secured Notes ( Notes ).  The Notes were called at a redemption price equal to 105.500 percent of the principal amount resulting in a redemption premium of $4.4 million. Additionally, $1.2 million of previously deferred financing fees related to the Notes was expensed as a result of this redemption. This compares to the August 2015 redemption of $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Notes, which were called at a redemption price equal to 108.250 percent of the principal amount resulting in a redemption premium of $12.4 million. Additionally, approximately $3.1 million of previously deferred financing fees related to the Notes were expensed as a result of the August 2015 redemption.  
     
  During August 2015, we amended our ABL Facility, which, among other changes, served to increase our revolving credit commitment from $1.25 billion to $1.40 billion. Additionally, we entered into an incremental facility amendment to the Credit Agreement whereby we obtained additional commitments from certain lenders under the ABL Facility, as well as reduced commitments from others. As a result of such amendments, we wrote-off approximately $0.7 million of previously deferred financing fees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470-50,  Modifications and Extinguishments of Debt.   
     
    Interest expense    
     
  Interest expense was $15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $19.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $4.3 million or 22%. Cash interest decreased $2.3 million, while the non-cash interest portion (consisting of deferred financing fees, amortized losses on terminations of derivative instruments and fair value adjustments for derivative instruments) decreased $2.0 million. The decrease in cash interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a lower effective interest rate during the current year period resulting from the August 2015 and August 2016 refinancing of $150.0 million and $80.0 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of 11% Senior Secured Notes with proceeds drawn under our ABL Facility which had a weighted-average interest rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of 2.77%. This decrease was partially offset by higher average debt levels during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

  The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 33%. This compares to 147% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. In both periods, the effective tax rate was adversely impacted by Canadian and Mexican tax provisions. In addition, the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by a lower state effective tax rate and the recognition of a Research   Development tax credit on the Project Helix costs. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was adversely affected due to discreet items recorded pertaining to changes in certain states  effective tax rates.

  Other revenue was $31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $9.3 million or 42%. This increase was primarily attributable to $11.0 million of emergency roadside repair billings resulting from the February 29, 2016 acquisition of Interstar and a $1.3 million increase in repair billings. These increases were partially offset by a $1.8 million reduction in billings for the repositioning of equipment and a decrease in scrap metal proceeds in connection with the disposal of end-of-life chassis of $1.1 million.  
     
   Marine Market segment   
     
  Total Marine Market segment revenue was $343.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $380.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $36.3 million or 10%.

  Equipment leasing revenue was $333.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $368.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $34.7 million or 9%. Marine pool per diem revenues decreased $33.1 million or 10%. This decrease was primarily due to a 6% decrease in the average per diem rates in our marine pools and a 4% decrease in the average number of chassis in our marine pools. These decreases were partially offset by one additional billing day during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which led to an increase in equipment leasing revenue of $1.1 million. The decrease in average per diem rates was primarily due to lower chassis usage within our marine pools, the impact of which was partially offset by higher per diem rates charged to motor carriers during the current year period. The net reduction in the number of chassis in our marine pools was primarily due to moving chassis into depot and long-

  term storage locations in reaction to the decline in demand experienced during the current year period, as well as a reduction in leased-in chassis, also as a result of the decline in demand. Marine pool per diem revenues attributable to motor carriers rose to 60% of total marine pool per diem revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 55% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Marine term lease revenues decreased $1.5 million or 5% primarily due to a 12% decrease in the average number of chassis on-hire, partially offset by a 7% increase in the average per diem rates. The decrease in the average number of chassis on hire was primarily due to reduced demand experienced during the current year period. The increase in the average per diem rates was primarily due to the expiration of lower rate term leases and incremental term leases at higher per diem rates.  
     
  Finance revenue was $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $0.1 million. This decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in the average investment in direct finance leases of $2.3 million due to normal amortization through principal payments and maturing lease arrangements, partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate for new direct finance lease arrangements.  
     
  Other revenue was $8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1.5 million or 14%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.3 million reduction in repair billings and a $0.2 million decrease in billings for the repositioning of equipment.  
     
   Domestic Market segment   
     
  Total Domestic Market segment revenue was $141.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $138.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3.1 million or 2%.

  Equipment leasing revenue was $136.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $131.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $4.7 million or 4%. Domestic pool per diem revenues increased $5.1 million or 4%. This increase was primarily due to a 4% increase in the average number of chassis in our domestic pools and one additional billing day during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which led to an increase in equipment leasing revenue of $0.5 million. Domestic term lease revenues decreased $0.4 million or 3% primarily due to a 6% decrease in the average number of chassis on-hire, partially offset by a 2% increase in the average per diem rates.  
     
  Other revenue was $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $1.7 million or 27%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.3 million reduction in billings for the repositioning of equipment and a $0.3 million decrease in repair billings.  
     
    Direct operating expenses    
     
  Total Company direct operating expenses were $284.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $283.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.8 million or less than 1%. Although overall maintenance and repair expenses decreased $2.9 million or 1%, the February 29, 2016 acquisition of Interstar resulted in $7.8 million of incremental maintenance and repair expenses. Conversely, maintenance and repair expenses within our Marine and Domestic Market Segments decreased $7.9 million or 4%, which was primarily due to a lower average cost per repair, as well as a net decrease in the average number of chassis operating in our marine and domestic chassis pools. The decrease in the average cost per repair within the Marine Market segment was primarily due to reduced maintenance and repair spending in response to the reduced demand experienced during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015, partially offset by a higher frequency of repairs. Maintenance and repair expenses for chassis residing at third party depots and at the Company s service centers decreased $2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015. Additionally, there was an increase in pool operational expense of $2.5 million, as well as an increase in storage costs and repositioning and handling expenses of $2.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively. The increase in pool operational expense was primarily due to facility rental agreements in the Northeast entered into during the fourth quarter of 2015. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in chassis usage fees of $3.2 million. Other direct operating expenses increased by $0.2 million.  
     
   Marine Market segment   
     
  Direct operating expenses for the Marine Market segment were $213.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $220.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $7.6 million or 3%. Maintenance and repair expenses decreased $10.3 million or 6%, which was primarily due to a lower average cost per repair and a decrease in the average number of chassis operating in our marine chassis pools. The decrease in the average cost per repair was primarily due to reduced maintenance and repair spending in response to the reduced demand experienced during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015, partially offset by a higher frequency of repairs. Additionally, there was a reduction in chassis usage fees of $3.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in storage costs of $2.7 million and pool operational expense of $2.4 million. In addition, repositioning and handling expenses increased $0.9 million versus the comparable period of 2015. Other direct operating expenses decreased by $0.1 million.

  Direct operating expenses for the Domestic Market segment were $48.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $45.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2.9 million or 6%. Maintenance and repair expenses increased $2.4 million or 8%, which was primarily due to a 4% increase in the average number of chassis operating in our domestic chassis pools and an increase in the average cost per repair partially offset by a lower frequency of repairs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015.  Additionally, we experienced an increase in repositioning and handling expenses of $0.2 million. Other direct operating expenses increased by $0.3 million. 
     
   Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA by segment   

Selling, general and administrative expenses    
     
  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $72.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $68.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $4.3 million or 6%. This increase was primarily due to incremental expenses of $2.4 million resulting from the Interstar acquisition and increased employee-related expenses in support of operational cost containment initiatives, including in-sourcing depot operations at select locations. Also contributing to this increase were consulting fees

  in support of information technology initiatives, costs associated with our relocation to a new corporate headquarters location in May 2015 and $1.6 million of costs associated with a debt offering process which was terminated during March 2016. These increases were partially offset by the capitalization of compensation and related benefit costs for employees directly associated with the development of Project Helix and a reduction in incentive-based compensation.  
     
    Depreciation expense    
     
  Depreciation expense was $56.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $53.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2.3 million or 4%. This increase was primarily due to incremental depreciation expense resulting from chassis acquired and remanufactured since October 1, 2015. The aforementioned chassis acquisitions were related to marine chassis purchased from the shipping lines and the purchase of previously leased-in domestic chassis to support the growth in the domestic pool. Also contributing to the increase in depreciation expense were amortized costs for leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures and computer equipment acquisitions associated with our new corporate headquarters.  
     
    Provision for doubtful accounts    
     
  The provision for doubtful accounts was $7.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $4.9 million. The increase was primarily due to a $6.7 million incremental reserve requirement resulting from Hanjin Shipping s August 2016 bankruptcy filing, partially offset by an improved collection experience with our motor carriers.  
     
    Impairment of leasing equipment    
     
  We recorded impairment charges on leasing equipment of $10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $4.3 million. This increase was primarily due to a greater number of end-of-life chassis impaired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the comparable period of 2015 and an increase in write-downs associated with axles unsuitable for the remanufacturing program.  
     
    Restructuring expense    
     
  In June 2016, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1.4 million related to employee severance and termination benefits. This action was taken in response to changing market conditions.  
     
    Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations    
     
  Loss on modification and extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations was $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $16.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $10.5 million. In August 2016, the Company redeemed $80.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Notes.  The Notes were called at a redemption price equal to 105.500 percent of the principal amount resulting in a redemption premium of $4.4 million. Additionally, $1.2 million of previously deferred financing fees related to the Notes was expensed as a result of this redemption. This compares to the August 2015 redemption of $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Notes, which were called at a redemption price equal to 108.250 percent of the principal amount resulting in a redemption premium of $12.4 million. Additionally, approximately $3.1 million of previously deferred financing fees related to the

  Notes were expensed as a result of the August 2015 redemption.  
     
  During August 2015, we amended our ABL Facility, which, among other changes, served to increase our revolving credit commitment from $1.25 billion to $1.40 billion. Additionally, we entered into an incremental facility amendment to the Credit Agreement whereby we obtained additional commitments from certain lenders under the ABL Facility, as well as reduced commitments from others. As a result of such amendments, we wrote-off approximately $0.7 million of previously deferred financing fees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470-50,  Modifications and Extinguishments of Debt.   
     
    Interest expense    
     
  Interest expense was $48.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $63.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $14.7 million or 23%. Cash interest decreased $9.3 million, while the non-cash interest portion (consisting of deferred financing fees, amortized losses on terminations of derivative instruments and fair value adjustments for derivative instruments) decreased $5.4 million. The decrease in cash interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a lower effective interest rate during the current year period resulting from the August 2015 and August 2016 refinancing of $150.0 million and $80.0 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of 11% Senior Secured Notes with proceeds drawn under our ABL Facility which had a weighted-average interest rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of 2.74%.  
     
    Other income, net    
     
  Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.4 million compared to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.3 million.  
     
    Provision for income taxes    
     
  The effective income tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 38% and 41%, respectively. In both periods, the effective tax rate was adversely impacted by Canadian and Mexican tax provisions. In addition, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by a lower state effective tax rate and the recognition of a Research   Development tax credit on the Project Helix costs.  
     
    Net income    
     
  Net income was $11.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net income of $18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the net income was attributable to the items noted above.

    Liquidity and Capital Resources    
     
  We have historically met our liquidity requirements primarily from revenues from operating activities from our subsidiaries, asset based lending facilities, leases and second lien borrowings.  
     
  Revenues from operating activities include term lease and marine and domestic pool revenues, direct finance lease collections, billings to lessees for maintenance and repairs and billings to lessees for repositioning and management fees.  Cash flow provided by operating activities was $104.6 million and $127.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  Amounts outstanding under existing borrowing facilities were $1.11 billion as of September 30, 2016 and $1.08 billion as of December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, we had $994.0 million outstanding under the ABL Facility and excess availability of $208.4 million.  No other amounts are available to draw under other currently available borrowing facilities.  Our ability to draw the excess availability could be limited in the future by testing of financial covenants and other ABL Facility limiters depending on the use of drawn funds.  
     
  On August 15, 2016, we borrowed $80.0 million under our ABL Facility which carries an interest rate of one-month LIBOR + 2.00%.  The funds were used to finance the redemption of $80.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.500 percent of such aggregate principal amount.  Approximately $84.4 million was paid to redeem the Notes, $80.0 million aggregate principal amount and a premium of $4.4 million.  Additionally, approximately $1.2 million of deferred financing fees related to the Notes were expensed upon redemption.  As of September 30, 2016, $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding.  
     
   Other Considerations   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $32.8 million of scheduled debt amortization over the next 12 month period.  These amounts do not include $33.8 million of interest payments, $20.0 million of asset and tire purchase commitments and $13.0 million of operating lease commitments existing as of September 30, 2016 and maturing over the next 12 months. We expect that cash flows from operations and principal collections on direct finance leases will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next 12 months, funding maturing debt and satisfying our contractual obligations. We believe that we will be able to maintain compliance with any applicable covenants in our indebtedness for the next 12 months.  However, we may need to borrow funds to finance the purchases of new and used assets or to remanufacture assets to expand the business. No assurance can be made that we will be able to meet our financing and other liquidity needs as currently contemplated.  
     
  On January 14, 2016, we borrowed $51.0 million (the  Repurchase Amount ) under the revolving credit facility of the ABL Facility to finance the repurchase and retirement of 62 shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the common stock of Interpool held by us, the sole stockholder of Interpool  Through a successive chain of dividends, the Repurchase Amount was received pro rata by our indirect shareholders of record, including certain private equity funds that are managed by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC, employees of affiliates of Seacastle Inc. (our indirect parent) and members of our management.

  Historically, the Company has had the ability to service debt obligations and to obtain additional financing as needed by the business. The majority of our debt is secured by long-lived assets which have proven to be an attractive collateral source for our lenders evidenced by our long history of obtaining capital lease obligations, term-loans and most recently, asset backed lending.  
     
    Liquidity needs for acquisition of new chassis    
     
  We expect to invest substantial funds to acquire new and used chassis and remanufacture and refurbish chassis, although there can be no assurances as to the timing and amount of such acquisitions.  During 2015, a total of $75.4 million was invested of which $33.7 million was used to acquire and refurbish marine chassis and $41.7 million was used to remanufacture domestic chassis.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $57.4 million was invested of which $38.7 million was used to acquire, refurbish and remanufacture marine chassis and $18.7 million was used to acquire and remanufacture domestic chassis.  We anticipate additional equipment investment during the remainder of 2016; however, deterioration in our performance, the credit markets or our inability to obtain additional financing on attractive terms, or at all, could limit our access to funding or drive the cost of capital higher than the current cost. These factors, as well as numerous other factors could limit our ability to raise funds and further the growth of our business.  
     
   Cash flow   
     
  Cash was $7.5 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $3.1 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $4.4 million.  Cash flow information for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:  

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the nine months ended September 30, 2015   
     
  Net cash provided by operating activities was $104.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $127.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $22.5 million.  The decrease was primarily the result of decreased profitability of $28.9 million partially offset by lower cash paid for interest and changes in working capital of $6.4 million.  
     
  Net cash used in investing activities was $68.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a $32.1 million increase in cash out-flows. The increase was primarily driven by an $18.7 million increase in capital spending, business acquisition of $4.8 million and an $8.3 million decrease in proceeds from the sales of leasing equipment and other assets in 2016 compared to 2015.

Table of Contents   
     
  Net cash used in financing activities was $31.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $91.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a $60.2 million increase in cash in-flows. The decrease in cash used for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to higher net borrowings of $104.3 million and a lower premium payment related to the note redemption of $8.0 million partially offset by the net dividend payment of $51.1 million and a $1.4 million increase in share repurchases from employees.  
     
   Contractual obligations and commitments   
     
  The following table summarizes our various contractual obligations in order of their maturity dates as of September 30, 2016.  

Our contractual obligations consist of principal and interest payments related to the ABL Facility, the Notes, chassis purchase commitments and operating lease payments for our chassis and office facilities. Interest payments are based upon the net effect of swapping our variable interest rate payments for fixed rate payments.  
     
   Covenants   
     
  Under the indenture governing the Notes, the ABL Facility and our other debt instruments, we are required to maintain certain financial covenants (as defined in each agreement) including a minimum tangible net worth test, a funded debt to tangible net worth test and a fixed charge coverage test. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture, the ABL Facility and other agreements.  We believe that we will be able to continue to maintain compliance with all applicable covenants for the next 12 months.

   Commitments   
     
    Chassis purchase commitments    
     
  Our chassis purchase commitments are related to commitments to refurbish chassis, remanufacture chassis and to exercise purchase options related to maturing capital leases. We do not bear the risks and rewards of ownership until delivery and therefore do not record an asset or a liability related to the refurbishing and remanufacturing commitments.  At September 30, 2016, we had commitments totaling approximately $38.9 million with commitments totaling $18.3 million, $10.6 million, $6.0 million and $4.0 million for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.  
     
    Tire purchase commitments    
     
  Contemporaneous with the Interstar acquisition, we committed to purchase from an affiliate of the acquired company 45,000 tires annually for a period of five years.  Initial prices for tire types were agreed upon but are subject to purchase price adjustments based on certain changes in the cost of raw materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the mix of tires to be purchased over the commitment period. At September 30, 2016, the tire purchase commitments are estimated to be $24.3 million with $1.8 million committed for 2016, $5.9 million committed for 2017 and $5.5 million committed for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.  
     
    Operating lease commitments    
     
  We are a party to various operating leases relating to office facilities and certain other equipment with various expiration dates through 2026. Minimum rental commitments under our material leases were $43.5 million as of September 30, 2016.  
     
   Off-balance sheet arrangements   
     
  In the ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction, such as an assignment and assumption agreement. These indemnifications might include claims related to tax matters, governmental regulations, and contractual relationships, among others. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third-party claim. One of the principal types of indemnification for which payment is possible is taxes. The other principal type of indemnity we may agree to is one in favor of certain lenders and chassis pool hosts indemnifying them against certain claims relating to the operation of our chassis, although this type of indemnity generally is covered by insurance or an indemnity in our favor from a third-party, such as a lessee or a vendor. We regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and have concluded that none are probable. We do not believe such arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.  
     
  Pursuant to our tax-related indemnifications, the indemnified party is typically protected from certain events that result in a tax treatment different from that originally anticipated. Our liability is typically fixed when a final determination of the indemnified party s tax liability is made. In some cases, a payment under a tax indemnification may be offset in whole or in part by refunds from the applicable governmental taxing authority. We are party to various tax indemnifications and many of these indemnities do not limit potential payment; therefore, we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of potential future payments that could result from

   Emerging Growth Company   
     
  Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an  emerging growth company  can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards after April 5, 2012. However, we are choosing to  opt out  of such extended transition period and as a result, we will comply with the new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.  
     
   Non-GAAP Measures   
     
   Adjusted EBITDA   
     
  Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of both operating performance and liquidity that is not defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for net income, income from operations or cash flow from operations, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  
     
  We define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) before provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment of assets and leasing equipment, loss on modification and extinguishment of debt and capital lease obligations, other expense (income), interest income, share-based compensation, principal collections on direct finance leases and other non-routine or non-cash items as determined by management.  
     
  Set forth below is additional detail as to how we use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of both operating performance and liquidity, as well as reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to our U.S. GAAP net income and cash flow from operating activities.  
     
   Operating performance:    Management and our board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA in a number of ways to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance, and we believe this measure is helpful to management, the board of directors and investors in identifying trends in our performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our consolidated operating performance exclusive of income and expenses that relate to financing, income taxes, and capitalization of the business. Also, Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA helps management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance. Accordingly, we believe this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely the cost structure and expenses of the organization.

   Liquidity:    In addition to the uses described above, management and our board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA as an indicator of the amount of cash flow we have available to service our debt obligations, and we believe this measure can serve the same purpose for our investors. We include principal collections on direct finance lease receivables in Adjusted EBITDA because these collections represent cash that we have available to service our debt obligations that is not otherwise included in net income. As a result, by adding back share-based compensation expenses and by including principal collections on direct finance lease receivables in Adjusted EBITDA, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is a more accurate indicator of our available cash flow to service our debt obligations than net income.

   Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    
     
  There has been no material change to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from those disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
     
   Item 4.      Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
     
   (a)              Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 
     
  The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2016.  Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
     
   (b)              Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  
     
  There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

  From time to time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of the normal course of business. As of the date hereof, the Company is involved in no litigation that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operation, or liquidity.  
     
   Item 1A.                                                     Risk Factors    
     
  In addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the information set forth in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  As of the date of this Form 10-Q, there have been no significant changes from the risk factors previously disclosed therein, other than the information set forth in this Item 1A.  
     
    Our business may be adversely affected if we are forced to pay fees and other charges related to services performed at the host locations at which we operate our chassis pools.    
     
  We are often responsible for the systematic inspection, repair and maintenance of the chassis in our chassis pool fleet. As the number of chassis in our chassis pools increases and our fleet ages, we may experience an increase in inspection, maintenance and repair costs. These costs may also increase if additional requirements to pay fees and costs related to inspections, repair and maintenance are imposed on us. A recent agreement reached between the Pacific Maritime Association ( PMA ) and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union ( ILWU ) provides for mandatory roadability inspections (subject to limited exceptions) of all chassis before they leave any of the West Coast terminals where the ILWU has jurisdiction (the  ILWU Roadability Program ). We have recently received invoices and payment demands from some host locations related to the ILWU Roadability Program. As of September 30, 2016, we have received invoices aggregating approximately $5.0 million.  Such host locations have asked us to pay an inspection fee for each chassis that leaves such location.  
     
  We are currently disputing such fees because, among other reasons, we believe there is no legal basis for them to be imposed and the ILWU Roadability Program provides for inspections beyond those required by applicable law. Since we believe that any amounts we may be required to pay are not probable, we are not currently accruing any expenses for these fees. However, if we are unsuccessful in challenging these fees, the fees we may be required to pay may be material. Moreover, if we are unsuccessful in challenging these fees and we are unable to pass them on to our customers or we lose access to certain host locations because of our refusal to pay them, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

  The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of SCT Chassis (the   Board  ) or its designee (the   Administrator  ).  The Administrator shall have discretionary and final authority to interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan and may adopt, alter or repeal any administrative rules, guidelines and/or practices governing the operation of the Plan as it shall from time to time deem advisable.  All decisions made by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including SCT Chassis, TRAC and each Participant (as defined below).  
     
   3.                                           Participation.  
     
  Each individual  who is employed by an Eligible Employer at the level of Vice President 6 or above on the applicable date of grant set forth in Section 6, together with each other employee of an Eligible Employer who is selected by the Administrator, shall receive an award of RSUs (each, a   Participant    provided ,  however , that except as otherwise determined by the Administrator, in no event will any individual who was granted an equity award in respect of SCT Chassis common stock prior to the effective date of this Plan be eligible to participate in the Plan until such equity award is fully vested. Once such equity award is fully vested, any individual who would otherwise be eligible to participate in the Plan shall be permitted to do so commencing January 1 of the following year. 
     
   4.                                           Term.  
     
  The Plan shall become effective as of October 1, 2016 (the   Effective Date  ) and shall thereafter remain in effect until the date on which the Plan is terminated in accordance with Section 7.  The period during which the Plan is in effect is referred to herein as the   Term  .  
     
   5.                                           Terms of Restricted Stock Units.  
     
  (a)                                     General Terms of RSUs .  Each RSU granted under the Plan represents the right to receive one (1) share of SCT Chassis common stock, subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan and a written award agreement by and among SCT Chassis, TRAC and the applicable Participant (an   Award Agreement  ). 
     
  (b)                                     Vesting of RSUs .  The vesting terms applicable to the RSUs granted under the Plan shall be as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding anything set forth in the applicable Award Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator may accelerate the vesting of any RSUs and the delivery of the related shares of SCT Chassis common stock at any time in its sole discretion. 
     
  (c)                                      Delivery of Shares .  The shares of SCT Chassis common stock underlying any RSUs that become vested under the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement will be delivered to the Participant by no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which such RSUs vest. 

6.                                           Grants of Restricted Stock Units.  
     
  (a)                                     RSU Grants in 2016 .  As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, each Participant will receive a grant of a number of RSUs in respect of TRAC s calendar year 2015 performance equal to (i) the applicable value set forth next to the Participant s title on  Annex A  ( the  Target RSU Value  ), divided by (ii) the price per share of SCT Chassis common stock determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion in respect of such grants.  For the avoidance of doubt, any Participant who holds a title that is not listed on  Annex A  will receive a grant of a number of RSUs as determined by the Administrator. 
     
  (b)                                     Annual RSU Grants in 2017 and Later .  For each calendar year during the Term, beginning with grants of RSUs to be made in the 2017 calendar year in respect of 2016 performance (the applicable year to which such performance relates, the   Performance Year  ), annual RSU grants will be made in accordance with the following procedures: 
     
  (i)                                        the Administrator will determine a target amount of Adjusted EBT of TRAC (as defined below) in respect of the Performance Year (the   Target Adjusted EBT   
     
  (ii)                                     as soon as practicable following the completion of the Performance Year, the Administrator will (A)  determine the price per share of SCT Chassis common stock that will be used to determine the number of such RSUs, if any, that are actually granted to each such Participant (the   Applicable Per Share Price  ) and (B) after consultation with the management of TRAC, determine in its sole discretion the percentage level of achievement of the Target Adjusted EBT (the   Actual Adjusted EBT Level   and 
     
  (iii)                                  on or about March 15 of the year following the Performance Year, the Administrator will make the applicable grants of RSUs to the Participants.  The actual number of RSUs that will be granted to each Participant in respect of the applicable Performance Year will be based on the Actual Adjusted EBT Level, and will be equal to (1) the  Applicable RSU Grant Value  set forth in the following table, divided by (2) the Applicable Per Share Price.  Examples illustrating the application of this Section 6(b) are set forth on  Annex B .

   7.                                           Amendment; Termination.   The Board shall have the right to amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time;  provided ,  however , that no such amendment, modification, suspension or termination may impair the rights of any Participant in respect of any RSUs previously granted under the Plan to such Participant without the Participant s consent. 
     
   8.                                           Miscellaneous.  
     
  (a)                                     No Right to Continued Employment .  The right of a Participant to be granted an RSU under the Plan shall not be deemed a right to continued employment by TRAC or any of its affiliates and does not otherwise restrict the Participant s right or the right of TRAC or any applicable affiliate to terminate the Participant s employment at any time, with or without notice and with or without cause.  The terms and conditions of each Participant s RSUs and the determinations and interpretations by the Administrator with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant (whether or not the Participants are similarly situated). 
     
  (b)                                     Unfunded Status of Awards .  The Plan is intended to constitute an  unfunded  plan for incentive compensation.

  (d)                                     Withholding Taxes .  SCT Chassis, TRAC or one of their respective subsidiaries shall withhold all applicable federal, state and local taxes in respect of all RSUs granted to a Participant under the Plan, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
     
  (e)                                      Governing Law .  The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its principles of conflict of laws. 
     
  (f)                                       Section 409A . Any payments made under the Plan are intended to be exempt from, or comply with, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (  Section 409A  ), and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted and administered to be in accordance therewith.  Any payments described in the Plan that are due within the  short-term deferral period  as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. SCT Chassis does not make any representation that any or all of the payments described in the Plan will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to any such payment.  Each Participant shall be solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and penalties incurred under Section 409A. 
     
  (g)                                      Shareholder Rights .  Notwithstanding anything set forth in the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, a Participant shall not have any rights of a shareholder in respect of the shares of SCT Chassis common stock underlying the RSUs, including any voting rights or any rights to dividends or other distributions (or equivalent or related payments), unless and until shares of SCT Chassis common stock are delivered in respect of the RSUs following the vesting thereof;  provided  that, beginning on the date on which the RSUs are granted and ending on the date prior to the date on which the RSUs vest (the   Vesting Period  ), the Participant shall be eligible to receive payments (if any) equal to the product of (A) the number of such unvested RSUs and (B) the amount per share of SCT Chassis common stock of any dividends or other distributions (or equivalent or related payments) (the   Per Share Dividend Amount  ) declared and paid during the Vesting Period, which such amount shall be subject to the same vesting conditions applicable to the RSUs as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement and shall be paid to the Participant (without interest) on or as soon as practicable after the 
     
 3   

date (if any) on which such RSUs vest;  provided further  that, beginning on the date on which the RSUs vest and ending immediately prior to the delivery of the related shares of Common Stock to the Participant (the   Interim Period  ), the Participant shall be entitled to receive payments (if any) equal to the product of (A) the number of such vested RSUs and (B) the Per Share Dividend Amount declared and paid during the Interim Period, which such amount shall be paid to the Participant on or as soon as practicable after the date on which such dividend or other distribution (or equivalent or related payments) is paid to holders of shares of SCT Chassis common stock generally.

Annex B    
     
   Examples   
     
  The following examples illustrate the application of Section 6(b) of the Plan, assuming for purposes of these examples that (A) the Participant s Target RSU Value set forth in  Annex A  is equal to 50% of the Participant s Performance Year base salary and (B) the Participant s Performance Year s base salary is equal to $100,000 per annum:  
     
  (i)                                        For Performance Year 1, the Administrator determines that the Target Adjusted EBT shall be $1,000,000.  As soon as practicable following the completion of Performance Year 1, the Administrator determines that the Applicable Per Share Price will be $10 for Performance Year 1.   After consultation with the management of TRAC, the Administrator determines in its sole discretion that the Actual Adjusted EBT Level for Performance Year 1 was $1,000,000.  As a result, 100% of the Target Adjusted EBT for Performance Year 1 was achieved, resulting in an Applicable RSU Grant Value equal to 100% of the Participant s Target RSU Value, or $50,000 (100% * (50% * $100,000)).  The actual number of RSUs that will be granted to the Participant in respect of Performance Year 1 will be equal to 5,000 RSUs ($50,000 / $10). 
     
  (ii)                                     For Performance Year 2, assume the same facts as Performance Year 1 (i.e., Target Adjusted EBT of $1,000,000 and Applicable Per Share Price of $10), except that after consultation with the management of TRAC, the Administrator determines in its sole discretion that the Actual Adjusted EBT Level for Performance Year 2 was $700,000.  As a result, only 70% of the Target Adjusted EBT for Performance Year 2 was achieved, resulting in no RSUs being granted. 
     
  (iii)                                  For Performance Year 3, assume the same facts as Performance Year 1 (i.e., Target Adjusted EBT of $1,000,000 and Applicable Per Share Price of $10), except that after consultation with the management of TRAC, the Administrator determines in its sole discretion that the Actual Adjusted EBT Level for Performance Year 3 was $1,100,000.  As a result, 110% of the Target Adjusted EBT for Performance Year 3 was achieved, resulting in an Applicable RSU Grant Value equal to 140% of the Participant s Target RSU Value, or $70,000 (140% * (50% * $100,000)).  The actual number of RSUs that will be granted to the Participant in respect of Performance Year 3 will be equal to 7,000 RSUs ($70,000 / $10). 
     
  (iv)                                 For Performance Year 4, assume the same facts as Performance Year 1 (i.e., Target Adjusted EBT of $1,000,000 and Applicable Per Share Price of $10), except that after consultation with the management of TRAC, the Administrator determines in its sole discretion that the Actual Adjusted EBT Level for Performance Year 4 was $1,250,000.  As a result, 125% of the Target Adjusted EBT for Performance Year 4 was achieved, resulting in an Applicable RSU Grant Value equal to 200% of the Participant s Target RSU Value, or $100,000 (200% * (50% * $100,000)).  The actual number of RSUs that will be granted to the Participant in respect of Performance Year 4 will be equal to 10,000 RSUs ($100,000 / $10).

  (i)            if the Participant s employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or the Participant resigns as an employee of the Company, the lesser of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Applicable Shares as of the Grant Date or (y) the Fair Market Value of the Applicable Shares as of the date of the Call Purchase Event; or  
     
 11   

(ii)           if the Participant s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause, or due to the Participant death or Disability while an employee of the Company, the Fair Market Value of the Applicable Shares as of the date of the Call Purchase Event.  
     
  (b)           If the Company does not elect to exercise its option set forth in Section 6(a) above, the Company shall give written notice that it is not so electing to each Fortress Entity owning Common Stock within the time periods specified in Section 6(a) for the giving of the Purchase Notice.  Upon receipt of such notice from the Company, each Fortress Entity owning Common Stock shall have the option, exercisable by written notice (a   Fortress Entity Purchase Notice  ) delivered to the Sellers within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice from the Company, to purchase from the Sellers (and, upon the giving of the Fortress Entity Purchase Notice, such Fortress Entity shall be obligated to purchase and the Sellers shall be obligated to sell) all, or any lesser portion indicated in the Fortress Entity Purchase Notice, of the Applicable Shares held by the Sellers; provided, however, if oversubscribed by more than one such Fortress Entity providing a Fortress Entity Purchase Notice, each such Fortress Entity shall purchase a pro rata portion of such Applicable Shares held by Sellers determined by its pro rata portion of all shares of Common Stock owned by such subscribing Fortress Entities) at the per share price determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 6.  
     
  (c)           In the event a purchase of Applicable Shares pursuant to this Section 6 shall be prohibited by law or would cause a default under the terms of any indenture or loan agreement or other instrument to which the Company or any of its affiliates may be a party, the obligations of the Sellers and the Company pursuant to this Section 6 shall be suspended and no such default shall be caused; provided, however, that (x) the purchase price to be paid by the Company for the Applicable Shares shall accrue interest at the lowest rate necessary to prevent the imputation of interest or original issue discount under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the   Code  ), reduced by any dividends or distributions received by the Participant (but not to an amount less than zero) on such Applicable Shares during the period of such suspension, which interest shall likewise be paid when such prohibition first lapses or is waived and no such default would be caused and (y) in the event of any such suspension, if one or more Fortress Entities so elect and no violation of law would be caused and no default under the terms of any indenture or loan agreement or other instrument to which the Company or any of its affiliates may be a party would result, the Company shall transfer its obligations under this Section 6 to such Fortress Entities, in which case such Fortress Entities and the Sellers shall be obligated to complete the purchase of Applicable Shares pursuant to this Section 6.  
     
  (d)           Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section 6 to the contrary, neither the Company nor a Fortress Entity shall exercise the option referenced in this Section 6 with respect to any Applicable Shares delivered in respect of RSUs that have vested within the six (6) months immediately preceding the date that the applicable Purchase Notice or Fortress Entity Purchase Notice is sent as provided in this Section 6, and in the event that any RSUs have vested within the six (6) months immediately preceding the date that would otherwise be the final day that the Company or the Fortress Entities may exercise the right to purchase the related Applicable Shares pursuant to this Section 6, then such final day shall become the date that is ten (10) business days following the expiration of such six (6) month period.  
     
 12   

7.              Restrictive Covenants .  The Participant acknowledges that during the period of the Participant s employment with the Company the Participant shall have access to secret and confidential information, knowledge and/or data relating to the Company and its businesses, and will meet and develop relationships with potential and existing suppliers, financing sources, clients, customers and employees of the Company.  
     
  (a)            Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation .  The Participant agrees that during the period of the Participant s employment with the Company, and for the one (1) year period immediately following termination of such employment (whether as a result of termination for Cause, termination other than for Cause, resignation, death, Disability or otherwise), the Participant shall not:  
     
  (i)            directly or indirectly (whether as principal, agent, independent contractor, partner, member, manager, officer, director or otherwise) own, manage, operate, control, participate in, perform services for, make any investment in or otherwise carry on, any business that is competitive with any business engaged in or conducted by the Company, or any business that the Company proposes or contemplates to engage in or conduct, at such time, including, but not limited to, the business of owning, renting or leasing (as lessor, sublessor, lessee or sublessee) or managing  intermodal chassis; or  
     
  (ii)           directly or indirectly engage in the recruiting, soliciting or inducing of any nonclerical employee or employees of the Company to terminate their employment with, or otherwise cease their relationship with, the Company, or in hiring or assisting another person or entity to hire any nonclerical employee of the Company or any person who within six (6) months before had been a nonclerical employee of the Company and were recruited or solicited for such employment or other retention while an employee of the Company (other than any of the foregoing activities engaged in with the prior written approval of the Company); or  
     
  (iii)          directly or indirectly solicit, induce or encourage or attempt to persuade any agent, supplier or customer of the Company to terminate such agency or business relationship.  
     
  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit or otherwise affect the ability of the Participant to own not more than one percent (1.0%) of the outstanding capital stock of any entity that is engaged in a business competitive with the Company, provided that such investment is a passive investment and such Participant is not directly or indirectly involved in the management or operation of such business or otherwise providing consulting services to such business.  In the event that the Participant inadvertently accumulates more than one percent (1.0%) of such competitive entity, provided the Participant gives the Company immediate written notice thereof and divests such passive investment within thirty (30) days of accumulating more than one percent (1.0%) of such competitive entity, the Company will not seek any other relief for violation of this provision.  
     
  (b)            Disparaging Comments .  The Participant agrees that the Participant shall not (i) both during and after the Participant s employment with the Company, make any disparaging or defamatory comments regarding the Company or any of its directors or officers,

The obligations of the Participant under this subparagraph shall not apply to disclosures required by applicable law, regulation or order of any court or governmental agency.  
     
  Nothing contained in this Section 7 shall limit any common law or statutory obligation that the Participant may have to the Company.  For purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Section 7, each reference to  the Company  shall be deemed to include any incorporated or unincorporated affiliates of the Company (including, without limitation, subsidiaries), including any entity which becomes the Participant s employer as a result of any business transaction, reorganization or restructuring of the Company for any reason.  
     
  The Company shall be entitled, in connection with tax planning or other reasons, to terminate the Participant s employment (which termination shall not be considered a termination without Cause for purposes of this Agreement or otherwise) in connection with an invitation from another affiliate of the Company to accept employment with such affiliate in which case the terms and conditions hereof shall apply to the Participant s employment relationship with such entity  mutatis mutandis .  
     
  (c)            Other Covenants .  Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, in the event that the Participant is subject to restrictive covenants or confidentiality obligations set forth in another agreement or arrangement with the Company, SCT Chassis or any of their respective subsidiaries that are determined by the Company to be more restrictive than those set forth in Sections 7 or 8 hereof, then such other restrictive covenants or confidentiality obligations shall be deemed to be incorporated into this Agreement and shall apply to the Participant in lieu of those set forth in this Agreement.  
     
  8.              Confidentiality .  During employment and following termination of employment, the Participant will hold and keep confidential all secret and confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company and its businesses, including any confidential information as to customers of the Company (i) obtained by the Participant during employment by the Company, and (ii) not otherwise public knowledge or known within the applicable industry.  Upon termination of employment with the Company, or at any time as the Company may request, the Participant will promptly deliver to the Company, as requested, all documents (whether prepared by the Company, the Participant or a third party) relating to the Company or any of its businesses or property which the Participant may possess or have under the Participant s direction or control other than documents provided to the Participant as a participant in any employee benefit plan, policy or program of the Company or any agreement by and between the Participant, SCT Chassis and/or the Company with regard to the Participant s employment or severance.  For purposes of the foregoing provisions of this Section 8, each reference to  the Company  shall be deemed to include any incorporated or unincorporated affiliates of the Company (including, without limitation, subsidiaries), including any entity which becomes the Participant s employer as a result of any business transaction, reorganization or restructuring of the Company for any reason.  
     
 14   

The Participant shall not, without prior written consent of the Company, unless compelled pursuant to the order of a court or other governmental or legal body having jurisdiction over such matter, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.  In the event the Participant is compelled by order of a court or other governmental or legal body to communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the foregoing, the Participant will promptly notify the Company of any such order and will cooperate fully with the Company in protecting such information to the extent possible under applicable law.  The Company agrees to reimburse the Participant for all reasonable expenses actually incurred and paid in connection with such cooperation, including reasonable attorneys  fees for separate counsel for the Participant, which counsel the Participant may select in the Participant s sole reasonable discretion.

  10.           Specific Performance, Forfeiture .  
     
  (a)            Specific Performance .  Due to the fact that the securities of SCT Chassis cannot be readily purchased or sold in the open market and because damages to the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates will be difficult to ascertain and remedies at law to the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates will be inadequate and for other reasons, the parties will be irreparably damaged in the event that this Agreement is not specifically enforced.  In the event of a breach or threatened breach of the terms, covenants and/or conditions of this Agreement by any of the parties hereto, the other parties shall, in addition to all other remedies, be entitled (without any bond or other security being required) to a temporary and/or permanent injunction, without showing any actual damage or that monetary damages would not provide an adequate remedy, and/or a decree for specific performance, in accordance with the provisions hereof.  
     
  (b)            Forfeiture .  The Participant acknowledges that if (x) the Participant breaches any term or condition contained in Section 7 or 8 of this Agreement and (y) the Company provides the Participant with written notice of such breach, all of the outstanding RSUs shall be automatically forfeited and cancelled without the payment of any consideration upon the giving of such notice.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Participant agrees that the Participant will execute and deliver a lock-up agreement with respect to any or all of the Applicable Shares (or any such shares of an affiliate of the Company issued in exchange therefor) owned by the Participant in connection with an IPO or other offering of securities by SCT Chassis or any of its affiliates, in form and substance reasonably requested by any underwriter or by SCT Chassis or any affiliate thereof, as applicable, provided that such lock-up agreement shall not be more onerous in its terms than the lock-up agreements provided by other senior executive officers of the Company in accordance with the requirements of the underwriter. 
     
  12.                                   Miscellaneous .

  (c)                                     No waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall be considered valid unless in writing, and no such waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default of the same or similar nature.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereby waive any provision of law which may render any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect. 
     
  (f)                                      Should any party to this Agreement be required to commence any litigation concerning any provision of this Agreement or the rights and duties of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party in such proceeding shall be entitled, in addition to such other relief as may be granted, to the reasonable attorneys  fees and court costs incurred by reason of such litigation.
