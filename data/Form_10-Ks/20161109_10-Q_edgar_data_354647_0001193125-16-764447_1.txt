    NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (Unaudited)       
   The condensed consolidated financial statements include CVB Financial Corp.
(referred to herein on an unconsolidated basis as  CVB  and on a consolidated basis as  we,   our  or the  Company ) and its wholly owned subsidiary: Citizens Business Bank (the  Bank  or
 CBB ) after elimination of all intercompany transactions and balances. The Company has one inactive subsidiary, Chino Valley Bancorp. The Company is also the common stockholder of CVB Statutory Trust III. CVB Statutory Trust III was
created in January 2006 to issue trust preferred securities in order to raise capital for the Company. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810,
 Consolidation , this trust does not meet the criteria for consolidation.    The Company s primary operations are related to
traditional banking activities. This includes the acceptance of deposits and the lending and investing of money through the operations of the Bank. The Bank also provides trust and investment-related services to customers through its CitizensTrust
Division. The Bank s customers consist primarily of small to mid-sized businesses and individuals located in San Bernardino County, Riverside County, Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Diego County, Ventura County, Santa Barbara
County, and the Central Valley area of California. The Bank operates 42 Business Financial Centers, eight Commercial Banking Centers, and three trust office locations. The Company is headquartered in the city of Ontario, California.  
 On February 29, 2016, we completed the acquisition of County Commerce Bank ( CCB ), headquartered in Ventura County with four
branch locations in Ventura County with total assets of approximately $253 million. This acquisition extends our geographic footprint northward into the central coast of California. Our condensed consolidated financial statements for 2016 include
CCB operations, post-merger. See Note 4   Business Combinations, included herein.    On September 22, 2016, we announced that we
entered into a merger agreement with Valley Commerce Bancorp ( VCBP ), pursuant to which its subsidiary, Valley Business Bank will merge into Citizens Business Bank. Valley Business Bank has four branch locations and total assets of
approximately $416 million. We expect to close this announced acquisition in the first quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory and Valley Commerce Bancorp shareholders  approvals.

  BASIS OF PRESENTATION       The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for Form 10-Q and conform to practices within the banking industry and include all of the
information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments), which are necessary for a fair presentation of financial results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accounting policies and financial notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC. A summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements follows.  
   Reclassification     Certain amounts in the prior periods  unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
related footnote disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation with no impact on previously reported net income or stockholders  equity.

  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Except as discussed below, our accounting
policies are described in Note 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  of our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC
( Form 10-K ).      Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements     The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relates to the determination of the
allowance for loan losses. Other significant estimates which may be subject to change include fair value determinations and disclosures, impairment of investments, goodwill, loans, as well as valuation of deferred tax assets.  
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606) , which provides revenue recognition guidance that is intended to create greater consistency with respect to how and when revenue from contracts with customers is shown in the income statement. This update to the ASC
requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes
effective. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Deferral of the Effective Date , which deferred the effective date for us of ASU No. 2014-09 to January 1,
2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method, with early adoption permitted, but not before January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its
consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02
establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with
classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective
transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.    In June 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets
and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard will replace the current  incurred loss  approach with an  expected loss  model. The new model, referred to as the Current
Expected Credit Loss ( CECL ) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans,
leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner
similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in
earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach). The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on
its consolidated financial statements.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The new guidance clarifies the classification within the statement of cash flows for certain transactions, including debt extinguishment costs, zero-coupon debt, contingent
consideration related to business combinations, insurance proceeds, equity method distributions and beneficial interests in securitizations. The guidance also clarifies that cash flows with aspects of multiple classes of cash flows or that cannot be
separated by source or use should be classified based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and will require
application using a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS         County Commerce Bank Acquisition    
 On February 29, 2016, the Bank acquired all of the assets and assumed all of the liabilities of CCB for $20.6 million in cash and $21.6
million in stock. As a result, CCB was merged with the Bank, the principal subsidiary of CVB. The Company believes this transaction serves to further expand its footprint northward into and along the central coast of California. At close, CCB had
four branches located in Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo, and Westlake Village. The systems integration of CCB and CBB was completed in April 2016.  
 Goodwill of $13.9 million from the acquisition represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
intangible assets acquired.    The total fair value of assets acquired approximated $252.4 million, which included $54.8 million in cash and
balances due from depository institutions, $1.5 million in FHLB stock, $168.0 million in loans and lease finance receivables, $8.6 million in fixed assets, $3.9 million in core deposit intangible assets acquired and $1.7 million in other assets. The
total fair value of liabilities assumed was $230.8 million, which included $224.2 million in deposits, $5.0 million in FHLB advances and $1.6 million in other liabilities. The assets and liabilities, both tangible and intangible, were recorded at
their estimated fair values as of February 29, 2016. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been accounted for under the acquisition method accounting. These fair values are estimates and are subject to adjustment for up to one year
after the acquisition date or when additional information relative to the closing date fair values becomes available and such information is considered final, whichever is earlier.  
 We have included the financial results of the business combination in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive
income beginning on the acquisition date.    For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred merger
related expenses associated with the CCB acquisition of $145,000 and $1.3 million, respectively.

  INVESTMENT SECURITIES       The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment
securities are summarized below. The majority of securities held are traded in markets where similar assets are actively traded. Estimated fair values were obtained from an independent pricing service based upon market quotes.  

(1) Securities held-to-maturity are presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at amortized
cost.    During the quarter ended September 30, 2015, investment securities were transferred from the available-for-sale security
portfolio to the held-to-maturity security portfolio. Transfers of securities into the held-to-maturity category from the available-for-sale category are transferred at fair value at the date of transfer. The fair value of these securities at the
date of transfer was $898.6 million. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) and in the carrying value of the held-to-maturity securities. The net
unrealized holding gain at the date of transfer was $3.9 million after-tax and will continue to be reported in AOCI and amortized over the remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment. At September 30, 2016, investment securities HTM
totaled $879.0 million. The after-tax unrealized gain reported in AOCI on investment securities HTM was $2.6 million at September 30, 2016.

  The following table provides information about the amount of interest income earned on investment
securities which is fully taxable and which is exempt from regular federal income tax.      
   Approximately 87% of the total investment securities portfolio at September 30, 2016 represents
securities issued by the U.S government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, with the implied guarantee of payment of principal and interest. All non-agency available-for-sale Collateralized Mortgage Obligations ( CMO )/Real Estate
Mortgage Investment Conduit ( REMIC ) issues held are rated investment grade or better by either Standard   Poor s or Moody s, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the
Bank had $101,000 in total CMO backed by whole loans issued by private-label companies (nongovernment sponsored).    The tables below show
the Company s investment securities  gross unrealized losses and fair value by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. Management has reviewed individual securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other-than-temporary. The unrealized losses on these securities were primarily attributed to changes
in interest rates. The issuers of these securities have not, to our knowledge, evidenced any cause for default on these securities. These securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market rates have fluctuated. However, we
have the ability and the intention to hold these securities until their fair values recover to cost or maturity. As such, management does not deem these securities to be Other-Than-Temporarily-Impaired ( OTTI ).  
 As of December 31, 2015, the Company had one OTTI HTM security with a net carrying value of $1.3 million. This security sold for a net
gain of $546,000 in the third quarter of 2016. The Company did not record any charges for OTTI losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, investment securities having a carrying value of
approximately $2.25 billion and $2.81 billion, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits, short and long-term borrowings, and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.  
 The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown in the table below.
Although mortgage-backed securities and CMO/REMIC have contractual maturities through 2057, expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay such obligations without penalty. Mortgage-backed
securities and CMO/REMIC are included in maturity categories based upon estimated prepayment speeds.

  ACQUIRED SJB ASSETS AND FDIC LOSS SHARING ASSET         FDIC Assisted Acquisition    
 On October 16, 2009, the Bank acquired San Joaquin Bank ( SJB ) and entered into loss sharing agreements with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) that is more fully discussed in Note 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The acquisition has
been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the October 16, 2009 acquisition date. The acquired loans were accounted for as Purchase Credit Impaired
( PCI ) loans. The application of the purchase method of accounting resulted in an after-tax gain of $12.3 million which was included in 2009 earnings. The gain is the negative goodwill resulting from the acquired assets and liabilities
recognized at fair value.    At September 30, 2016, the remaining discount associated with the PCI loans approximated $1.9 million.
Based on the Company s regular forecast of expected cash flows from these loans, approximately $1.2 million of the related discount is expected to accrete into interest income over the remaining average lives of the respective pools, which
approximates 3 years. The loss sharing agreement for commercial loans expired October 16, 2014.    The following table provides a summary of PCI loans
and lease finance receivables by type and by internal risk ratings (credit quality indicators) for the periods indicated.

     Allowance for Loan Losses ( ALLL )    
 The Company s Credit Management Division is responsible for regularly reviewing the ALLL methodology for PCI loans. The ALLL for PCI
loans is determined separately from total loans, and is based on expectations of future cash flows from the underlying pools of loans or individual loans in accordance with ASC 310-30, as more fully described in Note 3   Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses included $600,000 for PCI loans, compared to no allowance for
loan losses at December 31, 2015.

  LOANS AND LEASE FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES       The following table
provides a summary of total loans and lease finance receivables, excluding PCI loans, by type.      
   As of September 30, 2016, 76.69% of the total gross loan portfolio (excluding PCI loans) consisted of
real estate loans, 68.84% of which consisted of commercial real estate loans. Substantially all of the Company s real estate loans and construction loans are secured by real properties located in California. As of September 30, 2016,
$178.0 million, or 6.11% of the total commercial real estate loans included loans secured by farmland, compared to $173.0 million, or 6.54%, at December 31, 2015. The loans secured by farmland included $128.8 million for loans secured by
dairy   livestock land and $49.2 million for loans secured by agricultural land at September 30, 2016, compared to $128.4 million for loans secured by dairy   livestock land and $44.6 million for loans secured by agricultural
land at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, dairy   livestock and agribusiness loans of $239.2 million were comprised of $220.8 million for dairy   livestock loans and $18.4 million for agribusiness loans,
compared to $287.0 million for dairy   livestock loans and $18.5 million for agribusiness loans at December 31, 2015.    At
September 30, 2016, the Company held approximately $2.02 billion of total fixed rate loans, including PCI loans.    At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans totaling $3.15 billion and $2.91 billion, respectively, were pledged to secure the borrowings and available lines of credit from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank.

    Credit Quality Indicators    
 Central to our credit risk management is our loan risk rating system. The originating officer assigns each loan an initial risk rating, which
is reviewed and confirmed or changed, as appropriate, by credit management. Approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit management
personnel. Credits are monitored by line and credit management personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition, which would impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract. Risk ratings are adjusted as
necessary.    Loans are risk rated into the following categories (Credit Quality Indicators): Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful
and Loss. Each of these groups is assessed for the proper amount to be used in determining the adequacy of our allowance for losses. These categories can be described as follows:  
 Pass   These loans, including loans on the Bank s internal watch list, range from minimal credit risk to lower than average, but
still acceptable, credit risk. Watch list loans usually require more than normal management attention. Loans on the watch list may involve borrowers with adverse financial trends, higher debt/equity ratios, or weaker liquidity positions, but not to
the degree of being considered a defined weakness or problem loan where risk of loss may be apparent.    Special Mention   Loans
assigned to this category have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the Company s credit
position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.  
 Substandard   Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or
of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Substandard loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some
loss if deficiencies are not corrected.    Doubtful   Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified
substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or the liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  
 Loss   Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not
warranted. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset with insignificant value even though partial recovery may be
effected in the future.

     Allowance for Loan Losses    
 The Company s Credit Management Division is responsible for regularly reviewing the ALLL methodology, including loss factors and economic
risk factors. The Bank s Director Loan Committee provides Board oversight of the ALLL process and approves the ALLL methodology on a quarterly basis.  
 Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance is conducted on a regular basis and considers the Bank s overall loan
portfolio. Refer to Note 3    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a more detailed discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses.  
 Management believes that the ALLL was appropriate at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. No assurance can be given that
economic conditions which adversely affect the Company s service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased provisions for loan losses in the future.

    Past Due and Nonperforming Loans    
 We seek to manage asset quality and control credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio and the application of policies designed
to promote sound underwriting and loan monitoring practices. The Bank s Credit Management Division is in charge of monitoring asset quality, establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies
and procedures across the Bank. Reviews of nonperforming, past due loans and larger credits, designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan losses, and to determine the adequacy of the allowance, are conducted on an ongoing basis.
These reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers and any guarantors, the value of the applicable collateral, loan loss experience, estimated loan losses, growth in the loan portfolio, prevailing economic conditions and
other factors. Refer to Note 3   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for additional discussion concerning the Bank s policy for past due
and nonperforming loans.    A loan is reported as a Troubled Debt Restructured ( TDR ) when the Bank grants a concession(s) to a
borrower experiencing financial difficulties that the Bank would not otherwise consider. Examples of such concessions include a reduction in the interest rate, deferral of principal or accrued interest, extending the payment due dates or loan
maturity date(s), or providing a lower interest rate than would be normally available for new debt of similar risk. As a result of these concessions, restructured loans are classified as impaired. Impairment reserves on non-collateral dependent
restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows on the restructured loans discounted at the interest rate of the original loan agreement to the loan s carrying value. These impairment reserves are
recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan losses.    Generally, when loans are identified as impaired
they are moved to our Special Assets Department. When we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the loan for potential impairment using discounted cash flows, unless the loan is determined to be collateral dependent. In these cases, we use the
current fair value of collateral, less selling costs. Generally, the determination of fair value is established through obtaining external appraisals of the collateral.

    Impaired Loans    
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had impaired loans, excluding PCI loans, of $35.7 million. Of this amount, there was $3.0 million of
nonaccrual Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loans, $2.4 million of nonaccrual commercial real estate loans, $2.2 million of nonaccrual single-family residential ( SFR ) mortgage loans, $543,000 of nonaccrual commercial and
industrial loans, and $470,000 of nonaccrual consumer and other loans. These impaired loans included $30.0 million of loans whose terms were modified in a troubled debt restructuring, of which $3.0 million were classified as nonaccrual. The
remaining balance of $27.0 million consisted of 29 loans performing according to the restructured terms. The impaired loans had a specific allowance of $548,000 at September 30, 2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company had classified as
impaired, loans, excluding PCI loans, with a balance of $63.7 million with a related allowance of $669,000.    The following tables present
information for held-for-investment loans, excluding PCI loans, individually evaluated for impairment by type of loans, as and for the periods presented.

The Company recognizes the charge-off of the impairment allowance on impaired loans in the period in which a
loss is identified for collateral dependent loans. Therefore, the majority of the nonaccrual loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 have already been written down to the estimated net realizable value. The impaired loans with
a related allowance recorded are on nonaccrual loans where a charge-off is not yet processed, on nonaccrual SFR loans where there is a potential modification in process, or on smaller balance non-collateral dependent loans.

    Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments    
 The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure relates to commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and undisbursed funds on lines
of credit. The Company evaluates credit risk associated with the off-balance sheet loan commitments at the same time it evaluates credit risk associated with the loan and lease portfolio. There was no provision or recapture of provision for unfunded
loan commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to zero and a $500,000 recapture of provision for unfunded loan commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance in this reserve was $7.2 million and was included in other liabilities.      Troubled
Debt Restructurings ( TDRs )      Loans that are reported as TDRs are considered impaired and charge-off amounts are taken
on an individual loan basis, as deemed appropriate. The majority of restructured loans are loans for which the terms of repayment have been renegotiated, resulting in a reduction in interest rate or deferral of principal. Refer to Note 3   
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a more detailed discussion regarding TDRs.  
 As of September 30, 2016, there were $30.0 million of loans classified as a TDR, of which $3.0 million were nonperforming and $27.0
million were performing. TDRs on accrual status are comprised of loans that were accruing interest at the time of restructuring or have demonstrated repayment performance in compliance with the restructured terms for a sustained period and for which
the Company anticipates full repayment of both principal and interest. At September 30, 2016, performing TDRs were comprised of eight commercial real estate loans of $13.4 million, one construction loan of $7.7 million, 11 SFR mortgage loans of
$3.3 million, two SBA loans of $854,000, five commercial and industrial loans of $806,000, one dairy   livestock and agribusiness loan of $659,000, and one consumer loan of $380,000. There were no loans removed from TDR classification
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    The majority of TDRs have no specific allowance allocated as any
impairment amount is normally charged off at the time a probable loss is determined. We have allocated $472,000 and $607,000 of specific allowance to TDRs as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 The following table provides a summary of the activity related to TDRs for the periods presented.

  EARNINGS PER SHARE RECONCILIATION       Basic earnings per common share are computed by
dividing income allocated to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings per common share considers the number of tax-effected shares issuable upon the
assumed exercise of outstanding common stock options. Antidilutive common shares are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, shares deemed to be antidilutive,
and thus excluded from the computation of earnings per common share were 299,000 and 281,000, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, shares deemed to be antidilutive, and thus excluded from the computation of
earnings per common share were 251,000 and 234,000, respectively.    The table below shows earnings per common share and diluted earnings
per common share, and reconciles the numerator and denominator of both earnings per common share calculations.

  FAIR VALUE INFORMATION         Fair Value Hierarchy    
 Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.    The
following disclosure provides the fair value information for financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels
(Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3).      

Level 1 - includes assets and liabilities that have an active market that provides an objective quoted value for each unit. Here the active market quoted value is used to measure the fair value. Level 1 has the
most objective measurement of fair value. Level 2 is less objective and Level 3 is the least objective (most subjective) in estimating fair value.        

Level 2 - assets and liabilities are ones where there is no active market in the same assets, but where there are parallel markets or alternative means to estimate fair value using observable information inputs
such as the value placed on similar assets or liability that were recently traded.        

Level 3  -fair values are based on information from the entity that reports these values in their financial statements. Such data are referred to as unobservable, in that the valuations are not based on data
available to parties outside the entity.      Observable and unobservable inputs are the key elements that separate the levels
in the fair value hierarchy. Inputs here refer explicitly to the types of information used to obtain the fair value of the asset or liability.  
 Observable inputs include data sources and market prices available and visible outside of the entity. While there will continue to be
judgments required when an active market price is not available, these inputs are external to the entity and observable outside the entity; they are consequently considered more objective than internal unobservable inputs used for Level 3 fair
value.    Unobservable inputs are data and analyses that are developed within the entity to assess the fair value, such as management
estimates of future benefits from use of assets.    There were no transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.

    Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis    
 We may be required to measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value
usually result from application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets. For assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis that were held on the balance sheet at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, the following tables provide the level of valuation assumptions used to determine each adjustment and the carrying value of the related assets that had losses during the period.

    Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
 The following disclosure presents estimated fair value of our financial instruments. The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by
the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of
the amounts the Company may realize in a current market exchange as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts.       
 
  The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these
financial statements since that date, and therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented above.

The Company has identified two principal reportable segments:
Business Financial and Commercial Banking Centers ( Centers ) and the Treasury Department. The Bank has 42 Business Financial Centers and eight Commercial Banking Centers organized in geographic regions, which are the focal points for
customer sales and services. The Company utilizes an internal reporting system to measure the performance of various operating segments within the Bank which is the basis for determining the Bank s reportable segments. The chief operating
decision maker (currently our CEO) regularly reviews the financial information of these segments in deciding how to allocate resources and to assess performance. Centers are considered one operating segment as their products and services are similar
and are sold to similar types of customers, have similar production and distribution processes, have similar economic characteristics, and have similar reporting and organizational structures. The Treasury Department s primary focus is managing
the Bank s investments, liquidity and interest rate risk. Information related to the Company s remaining operating segments, which include construction lending, dairy   livestock and agribusiness lending, leasing, CitizensTrust,
and centralized functions have been aggregated and included in  Other.  In addition, the Company allocates internal funds to the segments using a methodology that charges users of funds interest expense and credits providers of funds
interest income with the net effect of this allocation being recorded in administration.    The following tables represent the selected
financial information for these two business segments. GAAP does not have an authoritative body of knowledge regarding the management accounting used in presenting segment financial information. The accounting policies for each of the business units
is the same as those policies identified for the consolidated Company and disclosed in Note 3    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income
numbers represent the actual income and expenses of each business unit. In addition, each segment has allocated income and expenses based on management s internal reporting system, which allows management to determine the performance of each of
its business units. Loan fees included in the  Centers  category are the actual loan fees paid to the Company by its customers. These fees are eliminated and deferred in the  Other  category, resulting in deferred loan fees for
the condensed consolidated financial statements. All income and expense items not directly associated with the two business segments are grouped in the  Other  category. Future changes in the Company s management structure or
reporting methodologies may result in changes in the measurement of operating segment results.

  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS       The Bank is exposed to certain risks relating to its
ongoing business operations and utilizes interest rate swap agreements ( swaps ) as part of its asset/liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank has entered into 80
interest-rate swap agreements with customers. The Bank then entered into identical offsetting swaps with a counterparty bank. The swap agreements are not designated as hedging instruments. The purpose of entering into offsetting derivatives not
designated as a hedging instrument is to provide the Bank a variable-rate loan receivable and to provide the customer the financial effects of a fixed-rate loan without creating significant volatility in the Bank s earnings.  
 The structure of the swaps is as follows. The Bank enters into a swap with its customers to allow them to convert variable rate loans to fixed
rate loans, and at the same time, the Bank enters into a swap with the counterparty bank to allow the Bank to pass on the interest-rate risk associated with fixed rate loans. The net effect of the transaction allows the Bank to receive interest on
the loan from the customer at a variable rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The changes in the fair value of the swaps primarily offset each other and therefore should not have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations,
although the Company does incur credit and counterparty risk with respect to performance on the swap agreements by the Bank s customer and counterparty, respectively. Our interest rate swap derivatives are subject to a master netting
arrangement with one counterparty bank. None of our derivative assets and liabilities are offset in the balance sheet.    We believe our
risk of loss associated with our counterparty borrowers related to interest rate swaps is mitigated as the loans with swaps are underwritten to take into account potential additional exposure, although there can be no assurances in this regard since
the performance of our swaps is subject to market and counterparty risk.      Balance Sheet Classification of Derivative Financial Instruments
     As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the total notional amount of the Company s swaps was $199.1
million, and $189.0 million, respectively. The location of the asset and liability, and their respective fair values are summarized in the tables below.

  BALANCE SHEET OFFSETTING       Assets and liabilities relating to certain financial
instruments, including, derivatives and securities sold under repurchase agreements ( repurchase agreements ), may be eligible for offset in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as permitted under accounting guidance. As noted above,
our interest rate swap derivatives are subject to a master netting arrangement with one counterparty bank. Our interest rate swap derivatives require the Company to pledge investment securities as collateral based on certain risk thresholds.
Investment securities that have been pledged by the Company to the counterparty bank continue to be reported in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets unless the Company defaults. We offer a repurchase agreement product to our
customers, which include master netting agreements that allow for the netting of collateral positions. This product, known as Citizens Sweep Manager, sells certain of our securities overnight to our customers under an agreement to repurchase them
the next day. The repurchase agreements are not offset in the condensed consolidated balances.

ITEM 2.  
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     
 The following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of CVB
Financial Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary. This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations. This discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report.  
    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
 The discussion and analysis of the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are based upon its unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.    The following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex
accounting estimates and principles. In each area, we have identified the variables we believe are most important in our estimation process. We utilize information available to us to make the necessary estimates to value the related assets and
liabilities. Actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables and information could change future valuations and impact the results of operations.

    OVERVIEW   
 For the third quarter of 2016, we reported net earnings of $25.4 million, compared with $25.5 million for the second quarter of 2016 and $27.9
million for the third quarter of 2015. This represented an increase of $66,000 over the prior quarter and a decrease of $2.4 million from the third quarter of 2015. Diluted earnings per share were $0.23 per share for the third quarter of 2016,
compared to $0.23 in the prior quarter and $0.26 for the same period last year. The third quarter of 2016 included $2.0 million in loan loss provision recapture and a $548,000 gain on the sale of investment securities in the third quarter of
2016. The second quarter of 2016 included the recognition of $2.6 million in nonaccrued income as a result of the payoff of three TDR loans. The third quarter of 2015 also included the recognition of $2.8 million in nonaccrued interest
income as a result of the payoff of one nonperforming loan.    At September 30, 2016, total assets of $8.04 billion increased $373.8
million, or 4.87%, from total assets of $7.67 billion at December 31, 2015. Interest-earning assets of $7.64 billion at September 30, 2016 increased $352.1 million, or 4.83%, when compared with $7.29 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase
in interest-earning assets was primarily due to a $278.2 million increase in total loans, a $136.4 million increase in total interest-earning balances due from the Federal Reserve, and a $50.5 million increase in interest-earning balances due from
depository institutions. This was partially offset by a $113.1 million decrease in total investment securities. At September 30, 2016, available-for-sale ( AFS ) investment securities totaled $2.23 billion, inclusive of a pre-tax
unrealized gain of $62.0 million, compared to $2.37 billion inclusive of a pre-tax unrealized gain of $30.9 million at December 31, 2015.  
      43  

Table of Contents  

  At September 30, 2016, held-to-maturity ( HTM ) investment securities totaled $879.0
million. The after-tax unrealized gain reported in AOCI on HTM investment securities was $2.6 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $3.0 million at December 31, 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we transferred investment
securities from our AFS security portfolio to HTM. Transfers of securities into the HTM category from the AFS category are transferred at fair value at the date of transfer. The fair value of these securities at the date of transfer was $898.6
million. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in accumulated other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of the held-to-maturity securities. The net unrealized holding gain at the date of transfer was $3.9
million after-tax and will continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) and amortized over the remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment. 
 Total loans and leases, net of deferred fees and discounts, were $4.30 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $4.02 billion at December
31, 2015 and $3.82 billion at September 30, 2015. Total loans and leases, net of deferred fees and discounts increased $278.2 million, or 6.93%, from December 31, 2015. The increase in total loans included $158.7 million of loans acquired
from County Commerce Bank ( CCB ). The $278.2 million increase in total loans was principally due to increases of approximately $256.9 million in commercial real estate loans, $55.2 million in commercial and industrial loans, $22.1 million
in construction loans, $7.7 million in single-family residential ( SFR ) mortgage loans, and $10.9 million in consumer loans. Dairy   livestock and agribusiness loans decreased by $67.2 million, primarily due to seasonal paydowns.
Total loans and leases, net of deferred fees and discounts increased $473.0 million, or 12.38%, from September 30, 2015. The growth in total loans from September 30, 2015 included increases of $325.2 million in commercial real estate loans,
$75.0 million in commercial and industrial loans, $33.1 million in construction loans, $26.6 million in Dairy   livestock and agribusiness loans, $19.8 million in SFR mortgage loans, and $9.4 million in consumer loans. Small Business
Administration ( SBA ) loans decreased by $12.2 million.    Noninterest-bearing deposits were $3.66 billion at September 30, 2016,
an increase of $407.4 million, or 12.54%, compared to $3.25 billion at December 31, 2015 and an increase of $352.6 million or 10.67%, when compared to September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, noninterest-bearing deposits were 57.86% of total
deposits, compared to 54.93% at December 31, 2015 and 55.46% at September 30, 2015.    Our average cost of total deposits was 0.09% for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 0.09% for the same period last year. Our cost of total deposits including customer repurchase agreements was 0.10% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to 0.10% for the same period last
year.    At September 30, 2016, we had no short-term borrowings, compared to $46.0 million at December 31, 2015 and zero at September 30,
2015.    At September 30, 2016, we had $25.8 million of junior subordinated debentures, unchanged from December 31, 2015 and September 30,
2015. These debentures bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.38% and mature in 2036.    The allowance for loan losses totaled $61.0
million at September 30, 2016, compared to $60.9 million at June 30, 2016 and $59.2 million at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses was reduced by $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, offset by net recoveries of $2.1 million. The
allowance for loan losses was 1.42%, 1.44%, 1.47%, and 1.55% of total loans and leases outstanding, at September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, respectively.  
 Our capital ratios under the revised capital framework referred to as Basel III remain well-above regulatory standards. As of September 30,
2016, the Company s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio totaled 11.06%, our common equity Tier 1 ratio totaled 16.58%, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio totaled 17.05%, and our total risk-based capital ratio totaled 18.30%. Refer to our
 Analysis of Financial Condition   Capital Resources  for further discussion on regulatory capital ratios.    On September 22,
2016, we announced that we entered into a merger agreement with Valley Commerce Bancorp ( VCBP ), pursuant to which its subsidiary, Valley Business Bank will merge into Citizens Business Bank. Valley Business Bank has four branch
locations and total assets of approximately $416 million. This acquisition is a strategic fit as VCBP is a well-regarded 20 year institution that strengthens our geographic footprint in the Central Valley area of California. We expect to
close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory and Valley Commerce Bancorp shareholders  approvals.

    Noninterest Expense and Efficiency Ratio Reconciliation (Non-GAAP)    
 We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide supplemental information regarding our performance. Noninterest expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included a debt termination expense of $16,000 and $13.9 million, respectively. We believe that presenting the efficiency ratio, and the ratio of noninterest expense to average assets, excluding the
impact of debt termination expense, provides additional clarity to the users of financial statements regarding core financial performance.      
   (1) Annualized 
   Net Interest Income      The
principal component of our earnings is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments (interest-earning assets) and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds (interest-bearing
liabilities). Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net
interest income and net interest margin. The net interest spread is the yield on average interest earning assets minus the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin and net interest spread are included on a tax
equivalent (TE) basis by adjusting interest income utilizing the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. Our net interest income, interest spread, and net interest margin are sensitive to general business and economic conditions. These conditions
include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, monetary supply, and the strength of the international, national and state economies, in general, and more specifically, the local economies in which we conduct business. Our ability to
manage net interest income during changing interest rate environments will have a significant impact on our overall performance. We manage net interest income through affecting changes in the mix of interest-earning assets as well as the mix of
interest-bearing liabilities, changes in the level of interest-bearing liabilities in proportion to interest-earning assets, and in the growth and maturity of earning assets. See Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial

    Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Reconciliations (Non-GAAP)    
 We use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide supplemental information regarding our performance. Net interest income for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include a yield adjustment of $543,000 and $1.0 million, respectively. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include a yield adjustment of $2.1 million and $3.0 million,
respectively. These yield adjustments relate to discount accretion on PCI loans, and are reflected in the Company s net interest margin. We believe that presenting net interest income and the net interest margin excluding these yield
adjustments provides additional clarity to the users of financial statements regarding core net interest income and net interest margin.

  The following tables present a comparison of interest income and interest expense resulting from
changes in the volumes and rates on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. Changes in interest income or expense attributable to volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in
volume by the initial average interest rate. The change in interest income or expense attributable to changes in interest rates is calculated by multiplying the change in interest rate by the initial volume. The changes attributable to interest rate
and volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in rate times the change in volume.     Rate and Volume Analysis for Changes

  Net interest income, before recapture of provision for loan losses, of $63.2 million for the
third quarter of 2016 decreased $2.8 million, or 4.18%, compared to $65.9 million for the third quarter of 2015. Average interest-earning assets of $7.82 billion grew by $596.7 million, or 8.27%, from $7.22 billion for the third quarter of
2015. Our net interest margin (TE) was 3.30% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 3.72% for the third quarter of 2015.  
 Interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $65.2 million, which represented a $2.6 million, or 3.78%, decrease when compared
to the same period of 2015. Interest income and fees on loans for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $47.8 million which represented a $1.1 million, or 2.19%, decrease when compared to the third quarter of 2015. The low interest rate
environment and competitive pricing pressures continued to impact both loan retention and loan yields during the third quarter of 2016. Our average yield on loans (excluding discount on PCI loans) was 4.41% for the current quarter, compared to
5.00% for the third quarter of 2015. The third quarter of 2015 was positively impacted by $2.8 million in nonaccrued interest income as a result of the payoff of one nonperforming commercial real estate loan. When this recapture is excluded,
the third quarter 2016 loan yield declined by 30 basis points from 4.71% to 4.41%. Further impacting loan yields between periods, was a decline in prepayment penalty income of $1.1 million from the third quarter of 2015 to $766,000 for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016. The impact of loan repricing and lower prepayment penalties combined for about a 27 basis point decline in loan yields and an approximate 16 basis point decline in the net interest margin. 
 In general, we stop accruing interest on a loan after its principal or interest becomes 90 days or more past due. When a loan is placed
on nonaccrual, all interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against earnings. There was no interest income that was accrued and not reversed on nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2016 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015,
we had $8.7 million and $23.6 million of nonaccrual loans (excluding PCI loans), respectively.    Interest income from total investments was
$16.2 million for the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 10.78%, from $18.2 million for the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was the result of both a $132.2 million decline in average investment securities and a 10 basis
point decline in the average non-TE yield on securities.   Interest expense of $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, increased
$196,000, or 10.80%, compared to $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2015. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased two basis points, to 0.23% for the third quarter of 2016, from 0.21% for the third quarter of
2015. Average interest-bearing liabilities were $20.0 million higher during the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015.  
 Net interest income, before recapture of provision for loan losses, was $191.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an
increase of $1.9 million, or 1.03%, compared to $189.7 million for the same period of 2015. Interest-earning assets grew on average by $429.9 million, or 6.03%, from $7.13 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $7.56 billion
for the current year. Our net interest margin (TE) was 3.46% during the first nine months of 2016, compared to 3.65% for the same period of 2015.  
 Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $197.7 million, which represented a $1.3 million, or 0.64%, increase when
compared to the same period of 2015. Interest income and fees on loans for the first nine months of 2016 totaled $143.8 million, which represented a $4.1 million, or 2.93%, increase when compared to the same period of 2015. This increase
was primarily due to a $401.9 million increase in average loans for the first nine months of 2016 when compared with the same period of 2015, offset by a 33 basis point decline in the average yield on loans (excluding discount on PCI loans) for the
same period of 2015.    During the first nine months of 2016, there were three TDR loans that were paid in full resulting in a $2.6 million
increase in interest income, or an 8 basis point increase in the loan yield. This compares to nonperforming loans paid in full resulting in a $4.1 million increase in interest income, or a 15 basis point increase in loan yield for the same
period of 2015. When the impact of the recaptured interest is excluded, the net interest margin (TE) declined from 3.58% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to 3.41% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Prepayment
penalties declined by $1.6 million from the same period of 2015 to $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The impact of loan repricing and lower prepayment penalties combined for about a 25 basis point decline in loan yields
and an approximate 13 basis point decline in the net interest margin.   Interest income from investment securities was $51.1 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, a $2.6 million decrease from $53.7 million for the first nine months of 2015. This decrease was the result of a six basis point decline` in the average non-TE yield on securities for the first nine months
of 2016, compared to the same period of 2015. Dividend income from FHLB stock for the first nine months of 2016 declined by $1.2 million from the same period of 2015, as the prior year included a special dividend of $923,000 paid by the
FHLB.

  Interest expense of $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, decreased by
$689,000 from the same period of 2015. Interest expense from FHLB advances and other borrowings declined by $1.3 million as a result of the repayment of a $200.0 million FHLB fixed rate debt during the first quarter of 2015.  
   Provision for Loan Losses      We
maintain an allowance for loan losses that is increased (decreased) by a provision (recapture) for loan losses charged against operating results. The provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to (subtracted
from) the allowance for loan losses after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to an appropriate level which, in management s best estimate, is necessary to absorb probable loan losses within the existing loan portfolio.
   The allowance for loan losses totaled $61.0 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $60.9 million at June 30, 2016 and $59.2 million
at December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan losses was reduced by $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2016, offset by net recoveries of $2.1 million. We recorded a $2.0 million loan loss provision recapture for the third quarter of 2016, compared
to $2.5 million for the same period of 2015. We believe the allowance is appropriate at September 30, 2016. We periodically assess the quality of our portfolio to determine whether additional provisions for loan losses are
necessary. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans and leases outstanding, net of deferred fees and discount, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 1.42% and 1.47%, respectively. Refer to the discussion of
 Allowance for Loan Losses  in Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained herein for discussion concerning observed changes in the credit quality of various components
of our loan portfolio as well as changes and refinements to our methodology.    No assurance can be given that economic conditions which
adversely affect the Company s service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased provisions for loan losses in the future, as the nature of this process requires considerable judgment. Net recoveries totaled $3.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.8 million for the same period of 2015. See  Allowance for Loan Losses  under  Analysis of Financial Condition  herein.  
 PCI loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transaction were initially recorded at their fair value and were covered by a loss sharing agreement
with the FDIC, which expired in October 2014 for commercial loans. Due to the timing of the acquisition and the October 16, 2009 fair value estimate, there was no provision for loan losses on the PCI loans in 2009. Refer to Note 3    Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a more detailed discussion about the FDIC loss sharing asset/liability. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
there were zero and approximately $92,000 in net charge-offs, respectively, for loans in excess of the amount originally expected in the fair value of the loans at acquisition.

    Noninterest Income    
 Noninterest income includes income derived from special services offered, such as CitizensTrust, BankCard services, international banking, and
other business services. Also included in noninterest income are service charges and fees, primarily from deposit accounts, gains (net of losses) from the disposition of investment securities, loans, other real estate owned, and fixed assets, and
other revenues not included as interest on earning assets.    The following table sets forth the various components of noninterest income
for the periods presented.      
    Third Quarter of 2016 Compared to the Third Quarter of 2015   
 Noninterest income of $9.2 million for the third quarter of 2016 increased $770,000, or 9.15%, over noninterest income of $8.4 million for the
third quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $548,000 gain on the sale of investment securities in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $215,000 in BOLI income and an increase of $136,000 in swap fee income. This was
partially offset by a decrease of $113,000 in service charges on deposit accounts.   CitizensTrust consists of Wealth Management and
Investment Services income. The Wealth Management group provides a variety of services, which include asset management, financial planning, estate planning, retirement planning, private and corporate trustee services, and probate services.
Investment Services provides self-directed brokerage, 401(k) plans, mutual funds, insurance and other non-insured investment products. At September 30, 2016, CitizensTrust had approximately $2.65 billion in assets under management and
administration, including $2.06 billion in assets under management. CitizensTrust generated fees of $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $53,000 compared to the third quarter of 2015.  
 The Bank invests in Bank-Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI ). BOLI involves the purchasing of life insurance by the Bank on a selected
group of employees. The Bank is the owner and beneficiary of these policies. BOLI is recorded as an asset at its cash surrender value. Increases in the cash value of these policies, as well as insurance proceeds received, are recorded in noninterest
income and are not subject to income tax, as long as they are held for the life of the covered parties. BOLI income of $706,000 for the third quarter of 2016 increased $215,000, or 43.79%, from $491,000 for the third quarter of 2015. 
  Nine Months of 2016 Compared to the Nine Months of 2015   
 The $2.4 million increase in noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a $1.1 million net gain on
sale of loans in the first quarter of 2016, a $272,000 net gain on the sale of our Porterville branch during the second quarter of 2016, and a $548,000 gain on the sale of investment securities in the third quarter of 2016. These gains were
offset by $379,000 in lower gain on sale of OREO during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. In addition, during the first nine months of 2015, there was a negative impact on noninterest income of
$803,000 resulting from the FDIC loss sharing agreement. Other income also included a $322,000 increase in swap fee income when compared to $199,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was partially offset by a decrease of
$457,000 in service charges on deposit accounts.

    Noninterest Expense    
 The following table summarizes the various components of noninterest expense for the periods presented. 

(1) 
 Noninterest expense divided by net interest income before provision for loan losses plus noninterest income.    
  Third Quarter of 2016 Compared to the Third Quarter of 2015   
 Our ability to control noninterest expenses in relation to asset growth can be measured in terms of total noninterest expenses as a percentage
of average assets. Excluding the impact of debt termination expense, noninterest expense measured as a percentage of average assets was 1.59% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 1.71% for the third quarter of 2015.  
 Our ability to control noninterest expenses in relation to the level of total revenue (net interest income before provision for loan losses
plus noninterest income) is measured by the efficiency ratio and indicates the percentage of net revenue that is used to cover expenses. For the third quarter of 2016, the efficiency ratio was 45.62%, compared to 44.05% for the third quarter of
2015.    Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2016 increased $264.000, compared to the third quarter of 2015. The $264,000 increase
was primarily the result of increased occupancy expense of $288,000 and increased merger related costs for both the VCBP and CCB acquisitions of $278,000, partially offset by a $420,000 decrease in professional services expense. 
  Nine Months of 2016 Compared to the Nine Months of 2015   
 Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $6.9 million, compared to the same period of 2015, as $13.9 million
in debt termination expense was incurred in the first nine months of 2015. Excluding the impact of debt termination expense, noninterest expense of $101.8 million increased $6.9 million, or 7.29%, year-over-year. This increase was primarily due
to a $3.9 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, principally due to $2.8 million in additional compensation related expenses resulting from the acquisition of CCB, the opening of our Santa Barbara commercial banking center in January
2016, and other strategic new hires. Year-over-year increases also included $608,000 in health care costs and payroll taxes, primarily due to growth in personnel. Occupancy expense increased by $813,000 for the first nine months of 2016
compared to the same period of 2015, as the CCB acquisition added four branches to our office locations. We converted the CCB core operating system into the

Table of Contents  

Company s application infrastructure in the second quarter of 2016. Acquisition expenses for the first nine months of 2016 of $1.6 million were primarily in connection with the CCB
acquisition for 2016. As a percentage of average assets, noninterest expense was 1.70% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 1.69%, excluding debt termination expense, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
   Income Taxes      The Company s
effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 38.44% and 37.50%, respectively, compared to 36.75% and 36.00%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our estimated annual effective tax
rate varies depending upon tax-advantaged income as well as available tax credits. The increase in the effective tax rate is a result of increases in taxable income and a relative decline in tax-advantaged income.  
 The effective tax rates are below the nominal combined Federal and State tax rate primarily as a result of tax-advantaged income from certain
municipal security investments and municipal loans and leases as a percentage of total income as well as available tax credits for each period.

     RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENTS   
 We have two reportable business segments: (i) Business Financial and Commercial Banking Centers ( Centers ) and (ii)
Treasury. The results of these two segments are included in the reconciliation between business segment totals and our consolidated total. Our business segments do not include the results of administration units that do not meet the
definition of an operating segment. There are no provisions for loan losses or taxes included in the segments as these are accounted for at the corporate level. Refer to Note 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Note 10  Business Segments  of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  
 Key measures we use to evaluate the segments  performance are included in the following table for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. These tables also provide additional segment measures useful to understanding the performance of these segments. Certain amounts in the prior periods  presentation of segments  performance have been
reclassified between segments to conform to the current year presentation with no impact on previously reported consolidated net income.      Business
Financial and Commercial Banking Centers         

(1) 
 Interest income and interest expense include credit for funds provided and charges for funds used, respectively. These are eliminated in the condensed consolidated presentation.    

(2) 
 Yield on loans excludes PCI discount accretion, and is accounted for at the corporate level.    
 For the third quarter of 2016, the Centers  segment pre-tax profit increased by $2.2 million, or 6.23%, primarily due to a $2.6 million,
or 5.73%, increase in interest income, compared to the third quarter of 2015. The $2.3 million increase in interest income for the third quarter of 2016 was principally due to a $444.1 million increase in average loans, partially offset by a 39
basis point drop in the loan yield to 4.48% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 4.87% for the third quarter of 2015. The year-over year increase in interest income was offset by a $369,000 increase in interest expense, compared to the
third quarter of 2015.

 The Company s administration and other operating departments reported pre-tax profit of $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2016, a
decrease of $2.8 million from a $5.4 million pre-tax profit for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in pre-tax profit was principally due to a $1.8 million decrease in interest income. The third quarter of 2015 included $2.8 million in
nonaccrued interest income as a result of the payoff of one nonperforming commercial real estate loan. The third quarter of 2016 also included a loan loss provision recapture of $2.0 million, compared to $2.5 million for the third quarter of
2015. Noninterest expense increased $338,000 primarily due to higher health care costs. Noninterest income included a $215,000 increase in BOLI income.

     ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION   
 The Company reported total assets of $8.04 billion at September 30, 2016. This represented an increase of $373.8 million, or 4.87%, from total
assets of $7.67 billion at December 31, 2015. Interest-earning assets of $7.64 billion at September 30, 2016 increased $352.1 million, or 4.83%, when compared with interest-earning assets of $7.29 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in
interest-earning assets was primarily due to a $278.2 million increase in total loans, a $136.4 million increase in total interest-earning balances due from the Federal Reserve and federal funds sold, and a $50.5 million increase in interest-earning
balances due from depository institutions. This was partially offset by a $113.1 million decrease in total investment securities. Total liabilities were $7.04 billion at September 30, 2016, an increase of $293.9 million, or 4.36%, from
total liabilities of $6.75 billion at December 31, 2015. Total equity increased $79.9 million, or 8.65%, to $1.01 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to total equity of $923.4 million at December 31, 2015.  
   Investment Securities      The
Company maintains a portfolio of investment securities to provide interest income and to serve as a source of liquidity for its ongoing operations. At September 30, 2016, we reported total investment securities of $3.11 billion. This represented a
decrease of $113.1 million, or 3.51%, from total investment securities of $3.22 billion at December 31, 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we transferred investment securities from our AFS security portfolio to HTM. Transfers of securities into
the HTM category from the AFS category are transferred at fair value at the date of transfer. The fair value of these securities at the date of transfer was $898.6 million. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in
accumulated other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of the held-to-maturity securities. The net unrealized holding gain at the date of transfer was $3.9 million after-tax and will continue to be reported in AOCI and amortized over the
remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment. At September 30, 2016, investment securities HTM totaled $879.0 million. The after-tax unrealized gain reported in AOCI on investment securities HTM was $2.6 million at September 30, 2016. At
September 30, 2016, our investment securities AFS totaled $2.23 billion, inclusive of a pre-tax unrealized gain of $62.0 million. The after-tax unrealized gain reported in AOCI on AFS investment securities was $36.0 million.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a pre-tax net unrealized holding gain on total investment securities of $64.6 million, compared
to a pre-tax net unrealized holding gain of $33.0 million at December 31, 2015. The changes in the net unrealized holding gain resulted primarily from fluctuations in market interest rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
repayments/maturities of investment securities totaled $638.5 million and $419.0 million, respectively. The Company purchased additional investment securities totaling $470.0 million and $431.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. We sold two investments securities with a recognized gain of $548,000 during the third quarter of 2016. This compares to one investment security sold during the first nine months of 2015 with a recognized loss of
approximately $22,000.

  The tables below set forth investment securities AFS and HTM for the periods presented.  

(1) Securities held-to-maturity are presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at amortized
cost.    The weighted-average yield on the total investment portfolio at September 30, 2016 was 2.45% with a weighted-average life of 3.9
years. This compares to a weighted-average yield of 2.55% at December 31, 2015 with a weighted-average life of 4.1 years. The weighted average life is the average number of years that each dollar of unpaid principal due remains outstanding.
Average life is computed as the weighted-average time to the receipt of all future cash flows, using as the weights the dollar amounts of the principal pay-downs.  
 Approximately 87% of the securities in the total investment portfolio, at September 30, 2016, are issued by the U.S. government or
U.S. government-sponsored agencies and enterprises, which have the implied guarantee of payment of principal and interest. As of September 30, 2016, approximately $110.3 million in U.S. government agency bonds are callable.

  The Agency CMO/REMIC are backed by agency-pooled collateral. All non-agency AFS CMO/REMIC
securities held are rated investment grade or better by either Standard   Poor s or Moody s, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We had three non-agency AFS CMO/REMIC securities with a carrying value of $101,000 and
$183,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.   The tables below show the Company s investment securities 
gross unrealized losses and fair value by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The unrealized losses on these securities
were primarily attributed to changes in interest rates. The issuers of these securities have not, to our knowledge, evidenced any cause for default on these securities. These securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market
rates have fluctuated. However, we have the ability and the intention to hold these securities until their fair values recover to cost or maturity. As such, management does not deem these securities to be Other-Than-Temporarily-Impaired
( OTTI ). A summary of our analysis of these securities and the unrealized losses is described more fully in Note 5      Investment Securities  of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Economic trends may adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had one OTTI HTM security with a net carrying value of $1.3
million. This security sold for a net gain of $546,000 in the third quarter of 2016. The Company did not record any charges for other-than-temporary impairment losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

    Loans    
 Total loans and leases, net of deferred fees and discounts, of $4.30 billion at September 30, 2016, increased by 278.2 million, or 6.93%, from
$4.02 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in total loans included $158.7 million of loans acquired from CCB. The $278.2 million increase in total loans was principally due to increases of approximately $256.9 million in commercial
real estate loans, $55.2 million in commercial and industrial loans, $22.1 million in construction loans, $7.7 million in SFR mortgage loans, and $10.9 million in consumer loans. Dairy   livestock and agribusiness loans decreased by $67.2
million, primarily due to seasonal paydowns.    Total loans, net of deferred loan fees, comprise 56.20% of our total interest-earning assets
as of September 30, 2016. The following table presents our loan portfolio, excluding PCI and held-for-sale loans, by type for the periods presented.  
  Distribution of Loan Portfolio by Type        
 
  As of September 30, 2016, $178.0 million, or 6.11% of the total commercial real estate loans included
loans secured by farmland, compared to $173.0 million, or 6.54%, at December 31, 2015. The loans secured by farmland included $128.8 million for loans secured by dairy   livestock land and $49.2 million for loans secured by agricultural land at
September 30, 2016, compared to $128.4 million for loans secured by dairy   livestock land and $44.6 million for loans secured by agricultural land at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, dairy   livestock and agribusiness loans of
$239.2 million was comprised of $220.8 million for dairy   livestock loans and $18.4 million for agribusiness loans, compared to $287.0 million for dairy   livestock loans and $18.5 million for agribusiness loans at December 31, 2015.

    PCI Loans from the SJB Acquisition    
 These PCI loans were acquired from SJB on October 16, 2009 and were subject to a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC. Under the terms of
such loss sharing agreement, the FDIC absorbs 80% of losses and shares in 80% of loss recoveries up to $144.0 million in losses with respect to covered assets, after a first loss amount of $26.7 million. The loss sharing agreement covered 5 years
for commercial loans and covers 10 years for single-family residential loans from the October 16, 2009 acquisition date and the loss recovery provisions are in effect for 8 and 10 years, respectively, for commercial and single-family
residential loans from the acquisition date. The loss sharing agreement for commercial loans expired on October 16, 2014.    The PCI
loan portfolio included unfunded commitments for commercial lines of credit, construction draws and other lending activity. The total commitments outstanding as of the acquisition date are included under the shared-loss agreement. As such, any
additional advances up to the total commitment outstanding at the time of acquisition were covered under the loss share agreement.    The
following table presents PCI loans by type for the periods presented.     Distribution of Loan Portfolio by Type (PCI)   

The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the initial fair value of acquired loans is
referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated life of the acquired loans using the effective yield method. The accretable yield will change due to:  

estimate of the remaining life of acquired loans which may change the amount of future interest income;        

estimate of the amount of contractually required principal and interest payments over the estimated life that will not be collected (the nonaccretable difference); and    

indices for acquired loans with variable rates of interest.      Commercial and industrial loans
are loans to commercial entities to finance capital purchases or improvements, or to provide cash flow for operations. SBA loans are loans, which are guaranteed in whole or in part by the SBA, to commercial entities and/or their principals to
finance capital purchases or improvements, to provide cash flow for operations for both short and long term working capital needs to finance sales growth or expansion, and commercial real estate loans to acquire or refinance the entities commercial
real estate. Real estate loans are loans secured by conforming trust deeds on real property, including property under construction, land development, commercial property and single-family and multi-family residences. Consumer loans include auto and
equipment leases, installment loans to consumers as well as home equity loans and other loans secured by junior liens on real property. Municipal lease finance receivables are leases to municipalities. Dairy   livestock and agribusiness loans
are loans to finance the operating needs of wholesale dairy farm operations, cattle feeders, livestock raisers, and farmers.

  Our SBA loans are comprised of SBA 504 loans and SBA 7(a) loans. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company had $17.7 million of total SBA 7(a) loans. The SBA 7(a) loans of include revolving lines of credit (SBA Express), term loans to finance long term working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and/or for the purchase or refinance of
commercial real estate. SBA 7(a) loans are guaranteed by the SBA at various percentages typically ranging from 50% to 75% of the loan, depending on the type of loan and when it was granted. SBA 7(a) loans are typically granted with a variable
interest rate adjusting quarterly along with the monthly payment. The SBA 7(a) term loans can provide financing for up to 100% of the project costs associated with the installation of equipment and/or commercial real estate which can exceed the
value of the collateral related to the transaction. These loans also provide extended terms not provided by the Bank s standard equipment and CRE loan programs.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $86.7 million of total SBA 504 loans. SBA 504 loans include term loans to finance capital
expenditures and for the purchase of commercial real estate. Initially the Bank provides two separate loans to the Borrower representing a first and second lien on the collateral. The loan with the first lien is typically at a 50% advance to the
acquisition costs and the second lien loan provides the financing for 40% of the acquisition costs with the Borrower s down payment of 10%. When the loans are funded the Bank retains the first lien loan for its term and sells the second lien
loan to the SBA subordinated debenture program. A majority of the Bank s 504 loans are granted for the purpose of commercial real estate acquisition.  
 Our real estate loans are comprised of industrial, office, retail, medical, single-family residences, multi-family residences, and farmland.
   Our loan portfolio is from a variety of areas throughout our marketplace. The following is the breakdown of our total held-for-investment

 Other loans consist of a variety of loan types, none of which exceeds 2.0% of total commercial real estate loans.    
 The SFR mortgage  Direct loans, excluding PCI loans, in the table above include SFR mortgage loans which are currently generated through
an internal program in our Centers. This program is focused on owner-occupied SFR s with defined loan-to-value, debt-to-income and other credit criteria, such as FICO credit scores, that we believe are appropriate for loans which are
primarily intended for retention in our Bank s loan portfolio. We originated loan volume in the aggregate principal amount of $11.8 million and $32.3 million under this program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 In addition, we previously purchased pools of owner-occupied single-family loans from real estate lenders, SFR mortgage Mortgage Pools,
with a remaining balance totaling $45.0 million at September 30, 2016. These loans were purchased with average FICO scores predominantly ranging from 700 to over 800 and overall original loan-to-value ratios of 60% to 80%. These pools were purchased
to diversify our loan portfolio. We have not purchased any mortgage pools since August 2007.

   Construction Loans      As of
September 30, 2016, the Company had $90.7 million in construction loans. This represents 2.11% of total gross loans held-for-investment. There were no PCI construction loans at September 30, 2016. Although our construction loans are located
throughout our market footprint, the majority of construction loans consist of commercial land development and construction projects in Los Angeles, Orange County, and the Inland Empire region of Southern California. At September 30, 2016,
construction loans consisted of $53.5 million in SFR construction loans and $37.2 million in commercial construction loans. As of September 30, 2016 there were no nonperforming construction loans.  
   Nonperforming Assets      The
following table provides information on nonperforming assets, excluding PCI loans, for the periods presented.       
 
  At September 30, 2016, loans classified as impaired, excluding PCI loans, totaled $35.7 million, or
0.83% of total gross loans, compared to $63.7 million, or 1.62% of total loans at December 31, 2015. The September 30, 2016 balance included nonperforming loans of $8.7 million. At September 30, 2016, impaired loans which were restructured in a
troubled debt restructure represented $30.0 million, of which $3.0 million were nonperforming and $27.0 million were performing.

  Of the $35.7 million total impaired loans as of September 30, 2016, $22.0 million were considered
collateral dependent and measured using the fair value of the collateral based on current appraisals (obtained within 1 year). The amount of impaired loans measured using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans
effective rate were $13.7 million.      Troubled Debt Restructurings    
 Total TDRs were $30.0 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $55.3 million at December 31, 2015. Of the $3.0 million in nonperforming TDRs
at September 30, 2016, all were paying in accordance with the modified terms at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, $27.0 million of performing TDRs were accruing interest as restructured loans. Performing TDRs were granted in response to
borrower financial difficulty and generally provide for a modification of loan repayment terms. The performing restructured loans represent the only impaired loans accruing interest at each respective reporting date. A performing restructured loan
is reasonably assured of repayment and is performing in accordance with the modified terms. We have not restructured loans into multiple loans in what is typically referred to as an  A/B  note structure, where normally the  A 
note meets current underwriting standards and the  B  note is typically immediately charged off upon restructuring.    The
following table provides a summary of TDRs, excluding PCI loans, for the periods presented.       
 
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $472,000 and $607,000 of the allowance for loan losses was
specifically allocated to TDRs, respectively. Impairment amounts identified are typically charged off against the allowance at the time a probable loss is determined. Total charge-offs on TDRs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were $38,000 and zero.

    Nonperforming Assets and Delinquencies    
 The table below provides trends in our nonperforming assets and delinquencies, excluding PCI loans, for the periods presented.  

We had $8.7 million in nonperforming loans, excluding PCI loans, defined as nonaccrual loans and
nonperforming TDRs, at September 30, 2016, or 0.20% of total gross loans. This compares to nonperforming loans of $17.5 million, or 0.41% of total loans, at June 30, 2016 and $21.0 million, or 0.52% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. The
$8.8 million decrease in nonperforming loans quarter-over-quarter was principally due to one nonperforming TDR commercial real estate loan that was returned to accrual status in the third quarter of 2016. This $8.6 million loan is a
participation interest in the Company s only Shared National Credit loan.    We had $4.8 million in OREO at September 30, 2016,
compared to $7.0 million at December 31, 2015 and $7.0 million at September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, we had two OREO properties, compared with four OREO properties at December 31, 2015 and five OREO properties at September 30, 2015.
During the first nine months of 2016, we sold two OREO properties with a carrying value of $1.8 million, realizing a net gain on sale of $30,000. There were no additions to OREO for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Changes in economic and business conditions have had an impact on our market area and on our loan portfolio. We continually monitor these
conditions in determining our estimates of needed reserves. However, we cannot predict the extent to which the deterioration in general economic conditions, real estate values, increases in general rates of interest and changes in the financial
conditions or business of a borrower, and drought conditions in California may adversely affect a borrower s ability to pay or the value of our collateral. See  Risk Management   Credit Risk  contained in our Annual Report on

    Acquired SJB Assets    
 Loans acquired through the SJB acquisition are accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30,  Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated
Credit Quality  ( ASC 310-30 ). PCI loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 are generally considered accruing and performing loans as the loans accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan when cash flows are reasonably
estimable. Accordingly, acquired impaired loans that are contractually past due are still considered to be accruing and performing loans. If the timing and amount of future cash flows is not reasonably estimable, the loans may be classified as
nonperforming loans and interest income is not recognized until the timing and amount of future cash flows can be reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2016, there were no PCI loans considered as nonperforming as described above. 
 There were no acquired SJB OREO properties remaining as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
   Allowance for Loan Losses      The
allowance for loan losses is established as management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease receivables portfolio. The allowance is increased (decreased) by the provision for losses and decreased by charge-offs when
management believes the uncollectability of a loan is confirmed which is charged against operating results. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are added to the allowance. The determination of the balance in the allowance for loan losses is based on an
analysis of the loan and lease finance receivables portfolio using a systematic methodology and reflects an amount that, in management s judgment, is appropriate to provide for probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio, after giving
consideration to the character of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, past loan loss experience, and such other factors that would deserve current recognition in estimating inherent credit losses.  
 The allowance for loan losses totaled $61.0 million as of September 30, 2016, compared to $59.2 million as of December 31, 2015. The allowance
for loan losses was reduced by a $2.0 million, offset by net recoveries of $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We recorded a $2.0 million loan loss provision recapture for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
a $4.5 million recapture of provision for loan losses for the same period of 2015.

 Net of deferred loan origination fees, costs and discounts, excluding PCI loans.       Specific
allowance:  For impaired loans, we incorporate specific allowances based on loans individually evaluated utilizing one of three valuation methods, as prescribed under ASC 310-10. If the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded
investment in the loan, the deficiency will be charged off against the ALLL or, alternatively, a specific allocation will be established and included in the overall ALLL balance. The specific allocation represents $548,000 (0.90%), $669,000
(1.13%) and $661,000 (1.12%) of the total allowance as of September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

   General allowance:    The loan portfolio collectively evaluated for impairment
under ASC 450-20 is divided into risk rating classes of loan receivables between  classified  loans (including substandard and doubtful loans)  Special Mention  loans and  Pass  loans, and are further disaggregated into
loan segments by loan type with similar risk characteristics. Both the classified and non-classified loan categories are divided into eight (8) specific loan segments. The allowance is provided for each segment based upon that segment s average
historical loss experience over an established look back period, adjusted for applicable loss emergence periods (i.e., the amount of time from the point at which a loss is incurred to the point at which the loss is confirmed), and further adjusted
for current conditions based on our analysis of specific environmental or qualitative loss factors, as prescribed in the 2006 Interagency Policy Statement on ALLL, affecting the collectability of our loan portfolio that may cause actual loss rates
to differ from historical loss experience. The above description reflects certain changes made to the Bank s ALLL methodology in the current period described further below. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2015 and coinciding with the
implementation of the new ALLL methodology, the Bank s previous  unallocated reserve  was absorbed into the qualitative component of the allowance and eliminated.  
 During the first quarter of 2016, the Bank adjusted the Historical Loss Rate (HLR) applied to the construction portfolio segment from a
segment level to a portfolio-wide HLR. Management determined that the actual losses recognized in the construction segment over the look-back period were no longer representative of the current risk in the construction loan portfolio due to
substantial changes in the Bank s lending policies and practices. In addition, since such changes were made, there have been no losses within the construction loan portfolio upon which to derive meaningful loss rates. All other
segment HLRs remained relatively stable due to the limited charge-offs and recoveries experienced during the first quarter. No other material changes were made to the Bank s ALLL methodology during the first quarter of 2016.  
 During the second quarter of 2016, the Bank made no adjustments to its existing allowance methodology. The metrics that drive the qualitative
component had movements which offset each other and resulted in minimal changes to the effect of the overall qualitative factors. Thus, as a result of the net effect of (i) continued reductions in the HLRs for all portfolio segments except CRE
owner occupied and residential real estate, which remained unchanged, (ii) changes in risk ratings and reductions in balances of certain loans centered in the dairy and livestock portfolio, (iii) net recoveries of $1.6 million, (iv) establishment of
the $310,000 allowance for PCI loans and (v) continued loan growth, the Bank determined that the ALLL balance of $60.9 million was appropriate and no provision or recapture of provision for loan losses was necessary for the current reporting
period. While we believe that the allowance at June 30, 2016 was appropriate to absorb losses from any known or inherent risks in the portfolio, no assurance can be given that economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations, conditions of our
borrowers, or natural disasters, which adversely affect our service areas or other circumstances or conditions, including those defined above, will not be reflected in increased provisions for loan losses in the future.  
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Bank updated its existing allowance methodology as part of its scheduled annual review to evaluate all
components of the model to ensure it performs consistently with meaningful results. The Company evaluated its (i) loan segmentation, (ii) look-back period, (iii) loss emergence periods, (iv) historical loss rates, and (v) qualitative factors
and structure. Based on our review of the model, certain changes were made to key components, including (i) the calculation of the allocable range of our qualitative factors, (ii) certain economic and credit metrics were added to our
qualitative factors, while others were deleted, to provide more relevant indicators of economic risk and credit performance, (iii) re-calculation of our portfolio and segment-level loss emergence periods was completed adding any loans in which the
bank incurred a charge-off in the last year to our prior calculation, and (iv) implementing certain lags in data requirements to improve reporting timeliness. The net effect of this annual model update was not material to the overall results of
the allowance. In addition, the Company performed its normal, quarterly updates to the allowance model including our historical loss rate calculations and current qualitative factors.  
 The Bank determined that the ALLL balance of $61.0 million was appropriate resulting in a recapture of provision for loan losses of $2.0
million for the current reporting period as a result of the net effect of reduced reserve requirements for (i) continued, moderate reductions in the historical loss rates for all portfolio segments except owner-occupied commercial real estate, which
remained unchanged, (ii) the effect of improving economic metrics on the qualitative factors, and (iii) net recoveries of $2.1 million in the quarter; some of which was offset by increased reserve requirements for (i) specific downgrades in the risk
ratings of loans centered in the dairy   livestock portfolio, (ii) an increase of $300,000 to the allowance for PCI loans and (iii) continued loan growth experienced during the quarter.  
 While we believe that the allowance at September 30, 2016 was appropriate to absorb losses from any known or inherent risks in the portfolio,
no assurance can be given that economic conditions, interest rate fluctuations, conditions of our borrowers, or natural disasters, which adversely affect our service areas or other circumstances or conditions, including those defined above, will not
be reflected in increased provisions for loan losses in the future.

    Deposits    
 The primary source of funds to support earning assets (loans and investments) is the generation of deposits.  
 Total deposits were $6.32 billion at September 30, 2016. This represented an increase of $403.7 million, or 6.82%, over total deposits of
$5.92 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in total deposits at September 30, 2016 included $209.6 million of total deposits acquired from CCB during the first quarter of 2016, of which $80.7 million were noninterest-bearing deposits. The
composition of deposits is summarized for the periods presented in the table below.       
 
  The amount of noninterest-bearing deposits in relation to total deposits is an integral element in
achieving a low cost of funds. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $3.66 billion at September 30, 2016, representing an increase of $407.4 million, or 12.54%, from noninterest-bearing deposits of $3.25 billion at December 31, 2015.
Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 57.86% of total deposits for September 30, 2016, compared to 54.93% of total deposits for December 31, 2015.  
 Savings deposits, which include savings, interest-bearing demand, and money market accounts, totaled $2.24 billion at September 30, 2016,
representing an increase of $280.4 million, or 14.33%, from savings deposits of $1.96 billion at December 31, 2015.    Time deposits totaled
$426.4 million at September 30, 2016, representing a decrease of $284.1 million, or 39.98%, from total time deposits of $710.5 million for December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to approximately $240.0 million of time deposits from
the state of California that matured and were not renewed during the third quarter of 2016. We considered these time deposits interest rate sensitive and elected not to renew as they matured.  
   Borrowings      In order to enhance
the Bank s spread between its cost of funds and interest-earning assets, we first seek noninterest-bearing deposits (the lowest cost of funds to the Bank). Next, we pursue growth in interest-bearing deposits, and finally, we supplement the
growth in deposits with borrowed funds (borrowings and customer repurchase agreements). Average borrowed funds, as a percent of total funding (total deposits plus borrowed funds), was 8.20% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 9.70% for the
same quarter of 2015.    At September 30, 2016, borrowed funds (customer repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and other borrowings) totaled
$578.0 million. This represented a decrease of $158.7 million, or 21.54%, from total borrowed funds of $736.7 million at December 31, 2015.  
 At September 30, 2016, we had no short-term borrowings, compared to $46.0 million at December 31, 2015.  
 We also offer a repurchase agreement product to our customers. This product, known as Citizens Sweep Manager, sells our investment securities
overnight to our customers under an agreement to repurchase them the next day at a price which reflects the market value of the use of funds by the Bank for the period concerned. These repurchase agreements are signed with customers who want to
invest their excess deposits, above a pre-determined balance in a demand deposit account, in order to earn interest. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, total customer repurchases were $578.0 million and $690.7 million, respectively,
with a weighted average interest rate of 0.24% and 0.23%, respectively.    At September 30, 2016, $3.15 billion of loans and $2.25 billion
of investment securities, at carrying value, were pledged to secure public deposits, short and long-term borrowings, and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.

    Aggregate Contractual Obligations    
 The following table summarizes the aggregate contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016.  

(1) 
 Amounts exclude accrued interest.      Deposits represent noninterest-bearing, money market,
savings, NOW, certificates of deposits, brokered and all other deposits held by the Bank.    Customer repurchase agreements represent excess
amounts swept from customer demand deposit accounts, which mature the following business day and are collateralized by investment securities. These amounts are due to customers.  
 At September 30, 2016 we had no short-term borrowings with the FHLB, compared to $46.0 million at a cost of 28 basis points at December 31,
2015.    Junior subordinated debentures represent the amounts that are due from the Company to CVB Statutory Trust III. The debentures
have the same maturity as the Trust Preferred Securities. These debentures bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.38% and mature in 2036.  
 Deferred compensation represents the amounts that are due to former employees  based on salary continuation agreements as a result of
acquisitions and amounts due to current employees under our deferred compensation plans.    Operating leases represent the total minimum
lease payments due under non-cancelable operating leases.    Affordable housing investment represents the commitment to invest in qualified
affordable housing partnerships that are payable on demand.    Advertising agreements represent the amounts that are due on various
agreements that provide advertising benefits to the Company.

    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    
 The following table summarizes the off-balance sheet items at September 30, 2016.  

As of September 30, 2016, we had commitments to extend credit of approximately $870.2 million, and obligations under letters of credit of
$36.5 million. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require payment of a fee. Commitments are generally variable rate, and many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. As such, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We use the
same credit underwriting policies in granting or accepting such commitments or contingent obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments, which consist of evaluating customers  creditworthiness individually. The Company had a reserve for
unfunded loan commitments of $7.2 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included in other liabilities.    Standby letters
of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the financial performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing or purchase arrangements. The credit risk involved in
issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. When deemed necessary, we hold appropriate collateral supporting those commitments.  
   Capital Resources      Our primary
source of capital has been the retention of operating earnings. In order to ensure adequate levels of capital, we conduct an ongoing assessment of projected sources, needs and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and the
level of risk. As part of this ongoing assessment, the Board of Directors reviews the various components of capital.    The Company s
total equity was $1.00 billion at September 30, 2016. This represented an increase of $79.9 million, or 8.65%, from total equity of $923.4 million at December 31, 2015. The increase for the first nine months of 2016 resulted from $74.4 million in
net earnings, $21.6 million for the issuance of common stock for the acquisition of CCB, a $17.7 million increase in other comprehensive income, net of tax, resulting from the net change in fair value of our investment securities portfolio, and $5.1
million for various stock based compensation items related to shares issued pursuant to our stock-based compensation plan. This was offset by $38.9 million for cash dividends declared on common stock.  
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors of CVB declared quarterly cash dividend totaling $0.12 per share. Dividends are
payable at the discretion of the Board of Directors and there can be no assurance that the Board of Directors will continue to pay dividends at the same rate, or at all, in the future. CVB s ability to pay cash dividends to its shareholders is
subject to restrictions under federal and California law, including restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve, and covenants set forth in various agreements we are a party to including covenants set forth in our junior subordinated debentures.

  On August 11, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company s common
stock repurchase program originally announced in 2008. The Board s authorization is currently 10,000,000 shares, or approximately 9.3% of the Company s currently outstanding shares. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company
did not repurchase any shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, we had 10,000,000 shares of our common stock remaining that are eligible for repurchase.  
 The Bank and the Company are required to meet risk-based capital standards set by their respective regulatory authorities. The risk-based
capital standards require the achievement of a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% and a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%. In addition, the regulatory authorities require the highest
rated institutions to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. To be considered  well-capitalized  for bank regulatory purposes, the Bank and the Company are required to have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio equal to or greater than
6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 10.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio equal to or greater than 5.0%. At September 30, 2016, the Bank and the Company
exceeded the minimum risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios required to be considered  well-capitalized  for regulatory purposes. For further information about capital requirements and our capital ratios, see Item 1. Business
  Capital Adequacy Requirements as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    At September
30, 2016, the Bank and the Company exceeded the minimum risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, under the revised capital framework referred to as Basel III, required to be considered  well-capitalized  for regulatory purposes.  
 The table below presents the Company s and the Bank s risk-based and leverage capital ratios for the periods presented.

     ASSET/LIABILITY AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT   
   Liquidity and Cash Flow      The
objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations when they come due without incurring unnecessary cost or risk, or causing a disruption to our normal operating
activities. This includes the ability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities, paying creditors as necessary, and other operating or capital
needs.    We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical
deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual customer funding needs, as well as current and planned business activities. Management has a Liquidity Committee that meets quarterly.
This committee analyzes the cash flows from loans, investments, deposits and borrowings. In addition, the Company has a Balance Sheet Management Committee of the Board of Directors that meets monthly to review the Company s balance sheet and
liquidity position. This committee provides oversight to the balance sheet and liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected
liquidity needs.    Our primary sources and uses of funds for the Company are loans and deposits. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits
may fluctuate from period-to-period due to a variety of factors, including the stability of our deposit base, prevailing interest rates, and market conditions. Total deposits of $6.32 billion at September 30, 2016 increased $403.7 million, or
6.82%, over total deposits of $5.92 billion at December 31, 2015.    In general, our liquidity is managed daily by controlling the level
of liquid assets as well as the use of funds provided by the cash flow from the investment portfolio, loan demand and deposit fluctuations. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of minimum levels
needed to fulfill normal business operations, short-term investment securities and other anticipated near term cash flows from investments. To meet unexpected demands, lines of credit are maintained with correspondent banks, the Federal Home
Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve. The sale of securities can also serve as a contingent source of funds. We can obtain additional liquidity from deposit growth by offering competitive interest rates on deposits from both our local and national
wholesale markets.    CVB is a company separate and apart from the Bank that must provide for its own liquidity and must service its own
obligations. Substantially all of CVB s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the Bank to CVB. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to CVB. In addition, our
regulators could limit the ability of the Bank or CVB to pay dividends or make other distributions. For the Bank, sources of funds include principal payments on loans and investments, growth in deposits, FHLB advances, and other borrowed funds. Uses
of funds include withdrawal of deposits, interest paid on deposits, increased loan balances, purchases, and noninterest expenses.   Below is
a summary of our average cash position and statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. For further details see our  Interim Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (Unaudited)  under Part I, Item 1 of this
report.     Consolidated Summary of Cash Flows       
   Average cash and cash equivalents increased by $44.4 million, or 12.17%, to $409.0 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to $364.6 million for the same period of 2015.    At September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents
totaled $259.2 million. This represented a decrease of $49.1 million, or 15.92%, from $308.2 million at September 30, 2015.

    Interest Rate Sensitivity Management    
 Interest rate risk is the potential change in net interest income resulting from changes in the level of interest rates. During periods of
changing interest rates, the ability to re-price interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities can influence net interest income, the net interest margin, and consequently, our earnings. Interest rate risk is managed by policy limits on
interest rate risk exposure established by the Board of Directors.    We monitor the interest rate  sensitivity  risk to earnings
from potential changes in interest rates using various methods, including a simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes.  
 The sensitivity of our net interest income is measured over both a one year and two year cumulative time horizon.  
 The simulation model estimates the impact of changing interest rates on interest income from all interest-earning assets and interest expense
paid on all interest-bearing liabilities reflected on our balance sheet. This sensitivity analysis is compared to policy limits, which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one-year horizon assuming no balance
sheet growth, given a 200 basis point upward and a 100 basis point downward shift in interest rates. The simulation model uses a parallel yield curve shift that ramps rates up or down on a pro rata basis over the 12-month and 24-month time
horizon.    The following depicts the Company s net interest income sensitivity analysis as of September 30, 2016.  
   
   Based on our current models, we believe that the interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet is generally
well matched with a slight asset sensitive bias over a two year horizon. The estimated sensitivity does not necessarily represent a forecast and the results may not be indicative of actual changes to our net interest income. These estimates are
based upon a number of assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, pricing strategies on loans and deposits, and replacement of asset and liability cash
flows. While the assumptions used are based on current economic and local market conditions, there is no assurance as to the predictive nature of these conditions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change.

  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       For quantitative and
qualitative disclosures about market risks in our portfolio, see  Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity Management  included in Item 2  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations  presented elsewhere in this report. This analysis should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our analysis of market risk and market-sensitive financial
information contain forward looking statements and is subject to the disclosure at the beginning of Part I regarding such forward-looking information.      

ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and other senior management of the Company.
Based on the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  
 During our most recent fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

     PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.  
  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       Certain lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of
business have been filed or are pending against us or our affiliates, including but not limited to actions involving federal and state securities law claims, employment, wage-hour and labor law claims, lender liability claims, trust and estate
administration claims, and consumer and privacy claims, some of which may be styled as  class action  or representative cases. Where appropriate, we establish reserves in accordance with FASB guidance over loss contingencies (ASC 450). The
outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, however, and it is possible that one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,
consolidated financial position, and/or results of operations. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any litigation reserves.  
 The Company is involved in the following legal actions and complaints which we currently believe could be material to us.  
 A purported shareholder class action complaint was filed against the Company on August 23, 2010, in an action captioned Lloyd v. CVB Financial
Corp., et al., Case No. CV 10-06256- MMM, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Along with the Company, Christopher D. Myers (our President and Chief Executive Officer) and Edward J. Biebrich, Jr. (our
former Chief Financial Officer) were also named as defendants. On September 14, 2010, a second purported shareholder class action complaint was filed against the Company, in an action originally captioned Englund v. CVB Financial Corp., et al., Case
No. CV 10-06815-RGK, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The Englund complaint named the same defendants as the Lloyd complaint and made allegations substantially similar to those included in the Lloyd
complaint. On January 21, 2011, the District Court consolidated the two actions for all purposes under the Lloyd action, now captioned as Case No. CV 10-06256-MMM (PJWx). At the same time, the District Court also appointed the Jacksonville Police
and Fire Pension Fund (the  Jacksonville Fund ) as lead plaintiff in the consolidated action and approved the Jacksonville Fund s selection of lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the consolidated action.  
 On March 7, 2011, the Jacksonville Fund filed a consolidated complaint naming the same defendants and alleging violations by all defendants of
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and violations by the individual defendants of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The consolidated complaint alleges that defendants, among other things,
misrepresented and failed to disclose conditions adversely affecting the Company throughout the purported class period, which was originally alleged to be between October 21, 2009 and August 9, 2010 (but which has subsequently been shortened to the
period between March 4, 2010 and August 9, 2010). Specifically, defendants are alleged to have violated applicable accounting rules and to have made misrepresentations in connection with the Company s allowance for loan loss methodology, loan
underwriting guidelines, methodology for grading loans, and the process for making provisions for loan losses. The consolidated complaint sought compensatory damages and other relief in favor of the purported class.  
 Following the filing by each side of various motions and briefs, and a hearing on August 29, 2011, the District Court issued a ruling on
January 12, 2012, granting defendants  motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, but the ruling provided the plaintiffs with leave to file an amended complaint within 45 days of the date of the order. On February 27, 2012, the plaintiffs
filed a first amended complaint against the same defendants, and, following filings by both sides and another hearing on June 4, 2012, the District Court issued a ruling on August 21, 2012, granting defendants  motion to dismiss the first
amended complaint, but providing the plaintiffs with leave to file another amended complaint within 30 days of this ruling. On September 20, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint against the same defendants, the Company filed its
third motion to dismiss on October 25, 2012, and following another hearing on February 25, 2013, the District Court issued an order dismissing the plaintiffs  complaint for the third time on May 9, 2013, which became a final, appealable order
on September 30, 2013.    On October 24, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the District Court s final order of dismissal
with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Following the filing of appellate briefs by the respective parties, the Court of Appeals conducted a hearing and oral argument in the case on December 10, 2015. On February 1, 2016, the
Court of Appeals issued its decision in the case. The Ninth Circuit opinion affirmed the district court s decision in part, reversed it in part and remanded the case for further proceedings in the District Court. 
 On September 28, 2016, the parties signed a memorandum of understanding that would resolve this case. The resolution is subject to final
court approval, but it would be funded solely with insurance proceeds, and would involve no admission of liability whatsoever.

  A former employee and branch-based service manager filed a complaint against the Company, on
December 29, 2014, in an action entitled Glenda Morgan v. Citizens Business Bank, et al., Case No. BC568004, in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County, individually and on behalf of the Company s branch-based employees and managers who
are classified as  exempt  under California and federal employment laws. The case is styled as a putative class action lawsuit and alleges, among other things, that (i) the Company misclassified certain employees and managers as
 exempt  employees, (ii) the Company violated California s wage and hour, overtime, meal break and rest break rules and regulations, (iii) certain employees did not receive proper expense reimbursements, (iv) the Company did not
maintain accurate and complete payroll records, and (v) the Company engaged in unfair business practices. On February 11, 2015, the same law firm representing Morgan filed a second complaint, entitled Jessica Osuna v. Citizens Business Bank, et
al., Case No. CIVDS1501781, in the Superior Court for San Bernardino County, alleging wage and hour claims on behalf of the Company s  non-exempt  hourly employees. On April 6, 2015, these two cases were consolidated in a first
amended complaint in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The first amended complaint sought class certification, the appointment of the plaintiffs as class representatives, and an unspecified amount of damages and penalties.  
 On May 11, 2015, the Company filed its answer to the first amended complaint denying all allegations regarding the plaintiffs  claims and
asserting various defenses. On May 24, 2016, the Company was served with a second amended complaint which, among other things, added a third and more recently-employed former employee, Theresa Ruiz, as one of the named plaintiffs in the action.
The parties are currently engaged in discovery, and the filing of briefs by the parties in connection with the class certification motion is not presently expected to commence until at least March the summer of 2017. The Company intends to
vigorously contest both (x) certification of the class action as well as (y) the substantive merits of the plaintiffs  claims.  
 On September 6, 2016, the Company received a demand from the same law firm representing the named plaintiffs in the class action seeking
penalties under the California Private Attorney General Act of 2004 ( PAGA ) on behalf of on behalf of Anjula Sharma and all current and former hourly-paid or non-exempt employees ( aggrieved employees ) for violation of certain
provisions of the California Labor Code and IWC Wage Orders. The PAGA demand alleges facts similar to those in the class action. The demand seeks applicable penalties arising out of the wage, hour and payroll practices, for violation of
the aforementioned provisions of the Labor Code pursuant to the PAGA. The Company denies the allegations and intends to vigorously contest any action brought under PAGA on behalf of the aggrieved employees. 
 We establish accruals for specific legal proceedings when it is considered probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated. Our accruals for loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as additional information becomes available. We disclose the amount accrued if we believe it is material or if we believe such disclosure is
necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. If a loss is not both probable and reasonably estimable, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount previously accrued, we assess whether there is at least a reasonable
possibility that a loss, or additional loss, may have been incurred, and we adjust our accruals and disclosures accordingly. Because the outcome of the consolidated wage-hour class action case, including the newly asserted PAGA demand, summarized
above are uncertain, we cannot predict any range of loss or even if any loss is probable related to the action. We do not presently believe that the ultimate resolution of the foregoing matters will have a material adverse effect on the
Company s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.      

ITEM 1A.  
  RISK FACTORS       There have been no material changes to the risk factors as previously
disclosed in Item 1A. to Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The materiality of any risks and uncertainties identified in our Forward Looking Statements contained in this report together with
those previously disclosed in the Form 10-K and any subsequent Form 10-Q or those that are presently unforeseen could result in significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 2.

ITEM 2.  
  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       On July 16, 2008, our
Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock (such number will not be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, and the like) in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, at
times and at prices considered appropriate by us, depending upon prevailing market conditions and other corporate and legal considerations. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had repurchased 2,579,322 shares for approximately $22.6 million. As of June
30, 2016, 7,420,678 shares remained available for repurchase. On August 11, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company s common stock repurchase program back to 10,000,000 shares, or approximately 9.3% of the
Company s s currently outstanding shares.

SEVERANCE COMPENSATION AGREEMENT   
  This agreement (the  Agreement ) is entered into this 1st day of June, 2016 ( Effective Date ), by and
between Citizens Business Bank (the  Bank ), and E. Allen Nicholson, Executive Vice President of the Bank (the  Executive ).      Whereas, the Bank s Board of Directors has determined that it is appropriate to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Bank s senior
management, including the Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction in potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change in Control (as defined herein) of CVB Financial Corp. (the  Company ) or the
Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company; and      Whereas, this Agreement sets forth the compensation which
the Bank agrees it will pay to the Executive upon a Change in Control and subsequent termination of the Executive s employment or resignation for good reason by the Executive.   
  Now, therefore, in consideration of these promises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and to induce
the Executive to remain employed by the Bank and to continue to exert Executive s best efforts on behalf of the Bank, the parties agree as follows:      1. Compensation Upon a Change in Control.      A. In
the event that a Change in Control occurs during the Bank s employment of the Executive and      (i) the
Executive s employment is terminated by the Company or the Bank or any successor to the Company or the Bank other than for Cause (as defined below), within one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the completion of such Change of Control or
within one (1) year after the completion of such Change in Control; or      (ii) the Executive resigns his or her
employment for Good Reason (as defined below) within one (1) year after the completion of such Change in Control;      the Executive shall receive the following: (i) an amount equal to (2) times the Executive s annual base compensation for the last calendar year ended immediately preceding the Change
in Control, plus (ii) an amount equal to (2) times the average annual bonus received for the last two calendar years ended immediately preceding the Change in Control, plus (iii) all accrued obligations (such as earned but unused vacation pay) and
vested benefits (including but not limited to any awards of stock options or restricted stock under any Bank or Company equity incentive plan) accrued prior to any such termination of or resignation by the Executive. The Bank shall pay such amounts
and/or provide such vested benefits, less applicable withholdings, employment and payroll taxes (which taxes shall be paid upon      1   

termination or resignation of Executive s employment or at the time payments are
made hereunder, as required by law), in 24 equal monthly installments (without interest or other adjustment) on the first day of each month commencing with the first such date that is at least six (6) months after the date of the Executive s
 separation from service  (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code pursuant to Treasury Regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder) and continuing for 23 successive months thereafter.
This payment schedule is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.      B. The Executive may designate in writing (on a form provided by the Bank and delivered by the Executive to the Bank before Executive s death, substantially in the form attached to
this Agreement) primary and contingent beneficiaries to receive the balance of any payments or vested or accrued benefits under section 1.A that are not made prior to the Executive s death and the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to
receive such payment. The total amount of the balance of such payment or the sum of such benefits shall be paid or transferred to such beneficiaries in a single unreduced lump sum payment or transfer made within ninety (90) days following the
Executive s death. The Executive may change beneficiary designations from time to time by completing and delivering additional such forms to the Bank. The last written beneficiary designation on such form delivered by the Executive to the Bank
prior to the Executive s death will control. If the Executive fails to designate a beneficiary in such manner, or if no designated beneficiary survives the Executive, then Executive s payment balance shall be paid to the Executive s
estate in an unreduced lump sum payment or vested benefit transfer within ninety (90) days following the Executive s death.      2. Definitions.      A. Change in Control. For
purposes of this Agreement, a  Change in Control  shall deemed to have occurred if:      (i) any one
person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12 month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company or the Bank possessing more than
50% of the total voting power of the Company s or the Bank s stock; provided, however, it is expressly acknowledged by the Executive that this provision shall not be applicable to any person who is, as of the date of this Agreement, a
Director of the Company or the Bank;      (ii) a majority of the members of the Company s Board of Directors
is replaced during any twelve (12) month period by directors whose appointment for election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company s board prior to the date of the appointment or election;   
  2   

(iii) a merger or consolidation where the holders of the Bank s or the
Company s voting stock immediately prior to the effective date of such merger or consolidation own less than 50% of the voting stock of the entity surviving such merger or consolidation;   
  (iv) any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquired (or has acquired during the twelve month period
ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Bank that have a total gross fair market value greater than 50% of the total gross fair market value of all of the Bank s assets immediately before the
acquisition or acquisitions; provided, however, transfer of assets which otherwise would satisfy the requirements of this subsection (iv) will not be treated as a Change in Control if the assets are transferred to:   
  (a) a shareholder of the Bank (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock;
     (b) an entity, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Company or the Bank;      (c) a person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or
indirectly, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Company or the Bank; or      (d) an entity, at least 50% of the total value or voting power is owned, directly or indirectly by a person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly,
50% or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Bank.      Each event comprising
a Change in Control is intended to constitute a  change in ownership or effective control , or a  change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets,  of the Company or the Bank as such terms are defined for purposes
of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and  Change in Control  as used herein shall be interpreted consistently therewith.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur as a result of any transaction which merely changes the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company or the
Bank.      B.  Good Reason  shall mean, for purposes of this Agreement:   
  (i) Executive s then current level of annual base salary is reduced without Executive s written consent;
     (ii) there is an (relative to Executive s annual base salary) overall reduction in the employee benefits
provided to Executive (including, without limitation, medical, dental, life and health insurance and incentive bonus opportunity) from the plans in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control;   
  3   

(iii) Executive suffers a diminution in his or her title, authority, duties or
responsibilities;      (iv) Any of Executive s salary payments, bonus payments and/or stock option grants are
not made or provided timely and in accordance either with this Agreement or applicable law;      (v) the relocation
of the location to which Executive is required to report to a location more than fifty (50) miles from the Executive s work location at the time of the Effective Date;      (vi) the Bank or any successor to the Bank either fails to assume or communicates that it intends to refuse to assume any part of this Agreement, including all of the Bank s or its
successor s obligations as set forth herein, except as otherwise required by law or regulation; or      (vii)
any material breach of this Agreement by the Bank or its successor,      C. Cause. For purposes of this Agreement,
the Bank shall have  Cause  to terminate the Executive s employment and shall not be obligated to make any payments hereunder or otherwise in the event the Executive has:   
  (i) committed a significant act of dishonesty, deceit or breach of fiduciary duty in the performance of Executive s
duties as an employee of the Bank;      (ii) grossly neglected or willfully failed in any way to perform
substantially the duties of such employment; or      (iii) acted or failed to act in any other way that reflects
materially and adversely on the Bank. In the event of a termination of Executive s employment by the Bank for Cause, the Bank shall deliver to Executive at the time the Executive is notified of the termination of his employment a written
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed by the Bank to provide a basis for the termination of the Executive s employment for Cause.   
  3. Term.      This agreement shall terminate, except to the extent that any obligation of the Bank hereunder remains unpaid as of such time, upon the earliest of the following (the  Term ):
     (i) the termination or resignation of the Executive s employment from the Bank for any reason (unless a
Change in Control has occurred and the Executive either has been terminated or has resigned for Good Reason within one (1) year after such Change in Control);      4   

(ii) three (3) years from the date hereof if a Change in Control has not occurred
during such period;      (iii) the termination of Executives  employment from the Bank for Cause within one
(1) year after a Change in Control;      (iv) one (1) year after a Change in Control if Executive is still employed
with the Bank or its successor; or      (v) after a Change in Control upon satisfaction of all of the Bank s
obligations hereunder.      4. No Obligation to Mitigate Damages; No Effect on Other Contractual Rights.
     A. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided for under
this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment by another employer after the effective
date of termination or resignation, or otherwise, by his or her engagement as a consultant or his conduct of any other business activities.      B. The provisions of this Agreement, and any payment provided for hereunder, shall not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish the Executive s existing rights, or
rights which would accrue solely as a result of the passage of time, under any employment agreement or other plan, arrangement or deferred compensation agreement, except as set forth in section 12 below or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Bank and the Executive.      5. Successor to the Bank.   
  A. The Bank will require any successor or assign (whether direct or indirect by purchase or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Bank, by written agreement with the Executive, to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in full. As used in this Agreement,  Bank  shall mean the Bank as herein before defined and
any successor or assign to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this section 5 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operations of law.
Notwithstanding the assumption of this Agreement by a successor or assign of the Bank, if a Change in Control (as defined in section 2.A above) has occurred, the Executive shall have and be entitled from such successor to all rights under section 1
of this Agreement.      B. If the Executive should die while any amounts are still payable or benefits are still
transferable to Executive hereunder, all such amounts shall be paid or benefits transferred in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive s designated beneficiary(ies) or, if there are no such designated beneficiary(ies), to
     5   

the Executive s estate. This Agreement shall, therefore, inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Executive s designated beneficiaries, personal and legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.   
  6. Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation.      The Executive shall retain in confidence any and all confidential information known to the Executive concerning the Company and the Bank and its business so long as such information is not
otherwise generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Executive. The Executive agrees that, for a period of one (1) year following any Change in Control, (i) the Executive shall not use the Bank s confidential
information or trade secrets to solicit the banking business of any customer with whom the Bank, the Company or a subsidiary bank is doing or has done business during the one (1) year period preceding any such Change in Control, (ii) use such
confidential information or trade secrets to encourage any such customers to stop using the facilities or services of the Bank, or (iii) use such confidential information or trade secrets to encourage any such customers to use the facilities or
services of any competitor of the Bank. The Executive further agrees, during the term of the Executive s employment with the Bank and for a one (1) year period following the termination of the Executive s employment with the Bank for any
reason, including a Change in Control or nonrenewal of this Agreement at the end of the Term, not to solicit the services of any officer, employee or independent contractor of the Bank or the Company.   
  7. Release.      As a condition to the Executive s receiving any payments pursuant to section 1 of this Agreement, Executive must sign and deliver a general release to the Company and the Bank, not
later than forty-five (45) days following the date of termination of employment, in form and substance acceptable to the Company and the Bank, releasing the Company, the Bank, their respective employees, officers, directors, stockholders and agents,
and each person who controls any of them within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, from any and all claims of any kind or nature, whether known or unknown (other than claims with respect to payments pursuant to
section 1 of this Agreement, payments of vested benefits or accrued obligations under any employee benefit plan of the Bank, or valid claims for indemnification), from the beginning of time to the date of termination.   
  8. Legal Fees and Expenses.      In the event of any judicial or non-judicial proceeding (including arbitration) of any dispute between the Bank and the Executive concerning the validity, enforceability, interpretation or
enforcement of this Agreement, the party that does not prevail in such dispute shall pay to the prevailing party all legal fees and expenses which the prevailing party may incur as a result of such proceeding.   
  9. Limitation on Payments.      6   

This Agreement is made expressly subject to the provision of law codified at 12 U.S.C.
1828 (k) and 12 C.F.R. Part 359 which regulate and prohibit certain forms of benefits to Executive. Executive acknowledges that he understands these sections of law and that the Bank s obligations to make payments hereunder are expressly
relieved if such payments violate these sections of law or any successors thereto.      In the event that the
Company or the Bank enters into or has entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement or other similar agreement with the United States Department of Treasury as part of the Capital Purchase Program under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of
2008 ( EESA ), the restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall apply to any payments under this Agreement. Solely to the extent, and for the period, required by the provisions of Section 111 of EESA applicable to participants in the
Capital Purchase Program under EESA and the regulation issued by the Department of the Treasury as published in the Federal Register on October 20, 2008, if the Executive is a  Senior Executive Officer  within the meaning of Section 111 of
EESA and the regulation issued by the Department of the Treasury as published in the Federal Register on October 20, 2008, then: (a) the Executive shall be ineligible to receive compensation hereunder to the extent that the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company or the Bank determines this Agreement includes incentives for the Executive to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the Company or the Bank; (b) the Executive shall be required to
forfeit any bonus or incentive compensation paid to the Executive hereunder during the period that the Department of the Treasury holds a debt or equity position in the Company or the Bank based on statements of earnings, gains, or other criteria
that are later proven to be materially inaccurate; and (c) the Company and the Bank shall be prohibited from making to the Executive, and the Executive shall be ineligible to receive hereunder, any  golden parachute payment  in connection
with the Executive s  applicable severance from employment,  in each case, within the meaning of Section 111 of EESA and the regulation issued by the Department of the Treasury as published in the Federal Register on October 20, 2008.
     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, if the Company s principal tax advisor determines
that the total amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, together with other payments to which Executive is entitled, would constitute an  excess parachute payment  (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code), as amended,
then the total payment under section 1.A above (and proportionally each monthly installment thereof) shall be reduced to the largest amount which may be paid without any portion of such amount being subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999
of the Internal Revenue Code.      10. Regulatory Provisions   
  (a) Suspension and Removal Orders. If the Executive is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the
conduct of the Bank s affairs by notice served under Section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1818(e)(3) and (g)(1)), the Bank s obligations under this Agreement   
  7   

shall be suspended as of the date of any such service, unless stayed by appropriate
proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the Bank shall (to the fullest extent permitted by law): (i) pay the Executive any compensation withheld while its obligations under this Agreement were suspended, as though the Executive was
never suspended; and (ii) reinstate (in whole or in part) any of its obligations under this Agreement which were suspended. If the Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of the Bank s affairs by an
order issued under Section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1818(e)(3) or (g)(1)), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but any vested
rights of the Executive shall not be affected.      (b) Termination by Default. If the Bank is in default (as
defined in Section 3(x)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1813(x)(1)), all obligations under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but any vested rights of the Executive shall not be affected.   
  11. Notice.      For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in the Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered or mailed by
United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid as follows:      If the Bank: Citizens

final and binding arbitration in Ontario, California before an arbitrator associated with the American Arbitration Association, JAMS or other mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service. If there is a dispute as to whether an issue or
claim is arbitrable, the arbitrator will have the authority to resolve any such dispute, including claims as to fraud in the inducement or execution, or claims as to validity, construction, interpretation or enforceability.   
  13. Validity.      The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect.      8   

14. Counterparts.

which together will constitute one and the same instrument.      15. Miscellaneous.   
  No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is
agreed to in writing signed by the Executive and the Bank. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party
shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or any prior to subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made
by either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. Any and all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements and/or severance agreements on the subject matter hereof (i.e., severance pay upon separation from service following a
Change in Control), including, but not limited to, the Severance Compensation Agreement between the Bank and the Executive dated December 31, 2011, are merged and integrated into and are superseded by this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to its conflicts of laws principles.      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above,      Citizens Business Bank      By: Christopher D. Myers

Exhibit 10.2    

SEVERANCE COMPENSATION AGREEMENT   
  This agreement (the  Agreement ) is entered into this 18th day of July, 2016 ( Effective Date ), by
and between Citizens Business Bank (the  Bank ), and David Farnsworth, Executive Vice President of the Bank (the  Executive ).      Whereas, the Bank s Board of Directors has determined that it is appropriate to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Bank s senior
management, including the Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction in potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change in Control (as defined herein) of CVB Financial Corp. (the  Company ) or the
Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company; and      Whereas, this Agreement sets forth the compensation which
the Bank agrees it will pay to the Executive upon a Change in Control and subsequent termination of the Executive s employment or resignation for good reason by the Executive.   
  Now, therefore, in consideration of these promises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and to induce
the Executive to remain employed by the Bank and to continue to exert Executive s best efforts on behalf of the Bank, the parties agree as follows:      1. Compensation Upon a Change in Control      A. In
the event that a Change in Control occurs during the Bank s employment of the Executive and      (i) the
Executive s employment is terminated by the Company or the Bank or any successor to the Company or the Bank other than for Cause (as defined below), within one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the completion of such Change of Control or
within one (1) year after the completion of such Change in Control; or      (ii) the Executive resigns his or her
employment for Good Reason (as defined below) within one (1) year after the completion of such Change in Control;      the Executive shall receive the following: (i) an amount equal to two (2) times the Executive s annual base compensation for the last calendar year ended immediately preceding the
Change in Control, plus (ii) an amount equal to two (2) times the average annual bonus received for the last two calendar years ended immediately preceding the Change in Control, plus (iii) all accrued obligations (such as earned but unused vacation
pay) and vested benefits (including but not limited to any awards of stock options or restricted stock under any Bank or Company equity incentive plan) accrued prior to any such termination of or resignation by the Executive. The Bank shall pay such
amounts and/or provide such vested benefits, less applicable withholdings, employment and payroll taxes (which taxes shall be      1   

paid upon termination or resignation of Executive s employment or at the time
payments are made hereunder, as required by law), in 24 equal monthly installments (without interest or other adjustment) on the first day of each month commencing with the first such date that is at least six (6) months after the date of the
Executive s  separation from service  (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code pursuant to Treasury Regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder) and continuing for 23 successive
months thereafter. This payment schedule is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.   
  B. The Executive may designate in writing (on a form provided by the Bank and delivered by the Executive to the Bank
before Executive s death, substantially in the form attached to this Agreement) primary and contingent beneficiaries to receive the balance of any payments or vested or accrued benefits under section 1.A that are not made prior to the
Executive s death and the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive such payment. The total amount of the balance of such payment or the sum of such benefits shall be paid or transferred to such beneficiaries in a single unreduced
lump sum payment or transfer made within ninety (90) days following the Executive s death. The Executive may change beneficiary designations from time to time by completing and delivering additional such forms to the Bank. The last written
beneficiary designation on such form delivered by the Executive to the Bank prior to the Executive s death will control. If the Executive fails to designate a beneficiary in such manner, or if no designated beneficiary survives the Executive,
then Executive s payment balance shall be paid to the Executive s estate in an unreduced lump sum payment or vested benefit transfer within ninety (90) days following the Executive s death.   
  2. Definitions.      A. Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement, a  Change in Control   shall deemed to have occurred if:   
  (i) any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12 month period ending
on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company or the Bank possessing more than 50% of the total voting power of the Company s or the Bank s stock; provided, however, it is expressly
acknowledged by the Executive that this provision shall not be applicable to any person who is, as of the date of this Agreement, a Director of the Company or the Bank;      (ii) a majority of the members of the Company s Board of Directors is replaced during any twelve (12) month period by directors whose appointment for election is not endorsed by a
majority of the members of the Company s board prior to the date of the appointment or election;      2

(iii) a merger or consolidation where the holders of the Bank s or the
Company s voting stock immediately prior to the effective date of such merger or consolidation own less than 50% of the voting stock of the entity surviving such merger or consolidation;   
  (iv) any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquired (or has acquired during the twelve month period
ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Bank that have a total gross fair market value greater than 50% of the total gross fair market value of all of the Bank s assets immediately before the
acquisition or acquisitions; provided, however, transfer of assets which otherwise would satisfy the requirements of this subsection (iv) will not be treated as a Change in Control if the assets are transferred to:   
  (a) a shareholder of the Bank (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock;
     (b) an entity, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Company or the Bank;      (c) a person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or
indirectly, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Company or the Bank; or      (d) an entity, at least 50% of the total value or voting power is owned, directly or indirectly by a person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly,
50% or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Bank.      Each event comprising
a Change in Control is intended to constitute a  change in ownership or effective control , or a  change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets,  of the Company or the Bank as such terms are defined for purposes
of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and  Change in Control  as used herein shall be interpreted consistently therewith.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur as a result of any transaction which merely changes the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company or the
Bank.      B.  Good Reason  shall mean, for purposes of this Agreement:   
  (i) Executive s then current level of annual base salary is reduced without Executive s written consent;
     (ii) there is an (relative to Executive s annual base salary) overall reduction in the employee benefits
provided to Executive (including, without limitation, medical, dental, life and health insurance and incentive bonus opportunity) from the plans in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control;   
  3   

(iii) Executive suffers a diminution in his or her title, authority, duties or
responsibilities;      (iv) Any of Executive s salary payments, bonus payments and/or stock option grants are
not made or provided timely and in accordance either with this Agreement or applicable law;      (v) the relocation
of the location to which Executive is required to report to a location more than fifty (50) miles from the Executive s work location at the time of the Effective Date;      (vi) the Bank or any successor to the Bank either fails to assume or communicates that it intends to refuse to assume any part of this Agreement, including all of the Bank s or its
successor s obligations as set forth herein, except as otherwise required by law or regulation; or      (vii)
any material breach of this Agreement by the Bank or its successor.      C. Cause. For purposes of this Agreement,
the Bank shall have  Cause  to terminate the Executive s employment and shall not be obligated to make any payments hereunder or otherwise in the event the Executive has:   
  (i) committed a significant act of dishonesty, deceit or breach of fiduciary duty in the performance of Executive s
duties as an employee of the Bank;      (ii) grossly neglected or willfully failed in any way to perform
substantially the duties of such employment; or      (iii) acted or failed to act in any other way that reflects
materially and adversely on the Bank. In the event of a termination of Executive s employment by the Bank for Cause, the Bank shall deliver to Executive at the time the Executive is notified of the termination of his employment a written
statement setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed by the Bank to provide a basis for the termination of the Executive s employment for Cause.   
  3. Term.      This agreement shall terminate, except to the extent that any obligation of the Bank hereunder remains unpaid as of such time, upon the earliest of the following (the  Term ):
     (i) the termination or resignation of the Executive s employment from the Bank for any reason (unless a
Change in Control has occurred and the Executive either has been terminated or has resigned for Good Reason within one (1) year after such Change in Control);      4   

(ii) three (3) years from the date hereof if a Change in Control has not occurred
during such period;      (iii) the termination of Executives  employment from the Bank for Cause within one
(1) year after a Change in Control;      (iv) one (1) year after a Change in Control if Executive is still employed
with the Bank or its successor; or      (v) after a Change in Control upon satisfaction of all of the Bank s
obligations hereunder.      4. No Obligation to Mitigate Damages; No Effect on Other Contractual Rights.
     A. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided for under
this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment by another employer after the effective
date of termination or resignation, or otherwise, by his or her engagement as a consultant or his conduct of any other business activities.      B. The provisions of this Agreement, and any payment provided for hereunder, shall not reduce any amounts otherwise payable, or in any way diminish the Executive s existing rights, or
rights which would accrue solely as a result of the passage of time, under any employment agreement or other plan, arrangement or deferred compensation agreement, except as set forth in section 12 below or as otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Bank and the Executive.      5. Successor to the Bank.   
  A. The Bank will require any successor or assign (whether direct or indirect by purchase or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Bank, by written agreement with the Executive, to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in full. As used in this Agreement,  Bank  shall mean the Bank as herein before defined and
any successor or assign to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this section 5 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operations of law.
Notwithstanding the assumption of this Agreement by a successor or assign of the Bank, if a Change in Control (as defined in section 2.A above) has occurred, the Executive shall have and be entitled from such successor to all rights under section 1
of this Agreement.      B. If the Executive should die while any amounts are still payable or benefits are still
transferable to Executive hereunder, all such amounts shall be paid or benefits transferred in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive s designated beneficiary(ies) or, if there are no such designated beneficiary(ies), to
     5   

the Executive s estate. This Agreement shall, therefore, inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Executive s designated beneficiaries, personal and legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.   
  6. Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation.      The Executive shall retain in confidence any and all confidential information known to the Executive concerning the Company and the Bank and its business so long as such information is not
otherwise generally known to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by Executive. The Executive agrees that, for a period of one (1) year following any Change in Control, (i) the Executive shall not use the Bank s confidential
information or trade secrets to solicit the banking business of any customer with whom the Bank, the Company or a subsidiary bank is doing or has done business during the one (1) year period preceding any such Change in Control, (ii) use such
confidential information or trade secrets to encourage any such customers to stop using the facilities or services of the Bank, or (iii) use such confidential information or trade secrets to encourage any such customers to use the facilities or
services of any competitor of the Bank. The Executive further agrees, during the term of the Executive s employment with the Bank and for a one (1) year period following the termination of the Executive s employment with the Bank for any
reason, including a Change in Control or nonrenewal of this Agreement at the end of the Term, not to solicit the services of any officer, employee or independent contractor of the Bank or the Company.   
  7. Release.      As a condition to the Executive s receiving any payments pursuant to section 1 of this Agreement, Executive must sign and deliver a general release to the Company and the Bank, not
later than forty-five (45) days following the date of termination of employment, in form and substance acceptable to the Company and the Bank, releasing the Company, the Bank, their respective employees, officers, directors, stockholders and agents,
and each person who controls any of them within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, from any and all claims of any kind or nature, whether known or unknown (other than claims with respect to payments pursuant to
section 1 of this Agreement, payments of vested benefits or accrued obligations under any employee benefit plan of the Bank, or valid claims for indemnification), from the beginning of time to the date of termination.   
  8. Legal Fees and Expenses.      In the event of any judicial or non-judicial proceeding (including arbitration) of any dispute between the Bank and the Executive concerning the validity, enforceability, interpretation or
enforcement of this Agreement, the party that does not prevail in such dispute shall pay to the prevailing party all legal fees and expenses which the prevailing party may incur as a result of such proceeding.   
  9. Limitation on Payments.      6   

This Agreement is made expressly subject to the provision of law codified at 12 U.S.C.
1828 (k) and 12 C.F.R. Part 359 which regulate and prohibit certain forms of benefits to Executive. Executive acknowledges that he understands these sections of law and that the Bank s obligations to make payments hereunder are expressly
relieved if such payments violate these sections of law or any successors thereto.      In the event that the
Company or the Bank enters into or has entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement or other similar agreement with the United States Department of Treasury as part of the Capital Purchase Program under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of
2008 ( EESA ), the restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall apply to any payments under this Agreement. Solely to the extent, and for the period, required by the provisions of Section 111 of EESA applicable to participants in the
Capital Purchase Program under EESA and the regulation issued by the Department of the Treasury as published in the Federal Register on October 20, 2008, if the Executive is a  Senior Executive Officer  within the meaning of Section 111 of
EESA and the regulation issued by the Department of the Treasury as published in the Federal Register on October 20, 2008, then: (a) the Executive shall be ineligible to receive compensation hereunder to the extent that the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company or the Bank determines this Agreement includes incentives for the Executive to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the Company or the Bank; (b) the Executive shall be required to
forfeit any bonus or incentive compensation paid to the Executive hereunder during the period that the Department of the Treasury holds a debt or equity position in the Company or the Bank based on statements of earnings, gains, or other criteria
that are later proven to be materially inaccurate; and (c) the Company and the Bank shall be prohibited from making to the Executive, and the Executive shall be ineligible to receive hereunder, any  golden parachute payment  in connection
with the Executive s  applicable severance from employment,  in each case, within the meaning of Section 111 of EESA and the regulation issued by the Department of the Treasury as published in the Federal Register on October 20, 2008.
     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, if the Company s principal tax advisor determines
that the total amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, together with other payments to which Executive is entitled, would constitute an  excess parachute payment  (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code), as amended,
then the total payment under section 1.A above (and proportionally each monthly installment thereof) shall be reduced to the largest amount which may be paid without any portion of such amount being subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999
of the Internal Revenue Code.      10. Regulatory Provisions   
  (a) Suspension and Removal Orders. If the Executive is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the
conduct of the Bank s affairs by notice served under Section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. Section 1818(e)(3) and (g)(1)), the Bank s obligations under this Agreement   
  7
