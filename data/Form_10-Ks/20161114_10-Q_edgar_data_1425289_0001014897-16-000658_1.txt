                             The accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed financial statements are an integral part of these statements.                           5                Table of Contents      BRIGHTLANE CORP.     NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     SEPTEMBER 30, 2016     (UNAUDITED)            NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS       Brightlane Corp. ( we ,  our ,  us , the  Company  or the  Registrant ) was initially incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in December 2006 under the name  Cold Gin Corporation.  On December 27, 2010, in connection with an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization we changed our domicile from Delaware to Nevada, our name to Bonanza Gold Corp.  In the third quarter of 2015, Brightlane Acquisition Corp. acquired a controlling interest in the Company from existing shareholders.  This change of control began the transitioning to a lease-to-own real estate company.  In connection with this transition, effective September 22, 2015 we changed our name to Brightlane Corp.       Our business model is oriented around acquiring single family homes and portfolios of single family homes and then lease-to-own the properties whereby the lessees will eventually own the home if they so choose.  Once the tenants fulfill their obligations under the contract, we will deliver the deed to the lessees.  We will actively pursue the acquisition of these types of homes through the purchase of bank REOs, portfolios and other methods of acquisition.         On December 21, 2015, we completed the agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Brightlane Homes, Inc. which through its wholly owned subsidiary acquired a 99.9% limited partner interest in Brightlane RECA LP which is the beneficiary of the Brightlane RECA Trust which owns a portfolio of assets here in referred to as the Brightlane RECA portfolio.  The Brightlane RECA portfolio consists of approximately 350 income-producing owner-financed and purchase money notes related to 350 single-family homes.  The underlying homes are geographically dispersed across the Great Lakes, Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, Midwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. and are held in a statutory trust known as Brightlane RECA Trust for which Brightlane RECA LP is the sole beneficiary. The largest concentrations are in the Southeast, particularly in South Carolina and North Carolina.  In addition to these income-producing owner-financed and purchase money notes, there are additional REO properties in the portfolio.       In May 2016, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary BrightLife Management.  This operation is handling the management of newly acquired homes and begin the process of vertically integrating property management services.  In the long-term this will allow us to:  (1) manage our own assets; and (2) transition assets currently managed by third parties into our integrated operations.  Both of these scenarios will have a positive impact on profitability.  We have begun investing in the appropriate software assets and personnel to effectively operate this new addition and enhancement to our operations, and have begun generating income this quarter.       NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN       The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The Company only generated minimal revenues since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $1,535,839 as of September 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties.  No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.        6            Table of Contents     The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.        NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of Presentation        The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016.        Use of Estimates        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.        Cash and Cash Equivalents        The Company accounts for cash and cash equivalents under FASB ASC 305,   Cash and Cash Equivalents  , and considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.          Convertible Instruments        The Company evaluates and account for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging Activities .       Applicable GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.       The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has been determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) as follows: The Company records when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption.        7        Table of Contents      Income Taxes        The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740  Income Taxes .  Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs.  A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.  No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.        Financial Instruments        The Company s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments: primarily accounts payable, accruals and debt obligations. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.        ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ,  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:              Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities              Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.              Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.        Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.        The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.            8        Table of Contents      Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries        Investments in non-consolidated entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and/or the Company's ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. When the equity method is used, investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize the Company's proportionate share of the investees' net income or losses after the date of investment. When net losses from an investment accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount, the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional losses are not provided for. The Company resumes accounting for the investment under the equity method if the entity subsequently reports net income and the Company's share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended. Investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred.        Long-lived Assets          Long-lived assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets. We did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented.        Related Parties        The Company follows ASC 850,   Related Party Disclosures,   for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.          Stock-Based Compensation        FASB ASC 718   Compensation   Stock Compensation,   prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based payments award to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights, may be classified as either equity or liabilities. The Company determines if a present obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if: (a) the option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or (b) the present obligation is implied because of an entity s past practices or stated policies. If a present obligation exists, the transaction should be recognized as a liability; otherwise, the transaction should be recognized as equity.       The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 505-50   Equity   Based Payments to Non-Employees .  Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.             9        Table of Contents      Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements        We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.        Revenue Recognition         The Company s revenue is currently from property management services. The Company follows the guidance of the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition.  We record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been performed, the selling price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured.        NOTE 4   INVESTMENT IN NON-CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY       On December 21, 2015, we completed an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Brightlane Homes, Inc. which through its wholly owned subsidiary had previously acquired a 99.9% limited partner interest in Brightlane RECA LP which is the beneficiary of the Brightlane RECA Trust which owns a portfolio of assets here in referred to as the Brightlane RECA portfolio.  The Brightlane RECA portfolio consists of approximately 350 income-producing owner-financed and purchase money notes related to 350 single-family homes and real estate properties owned.  The Company is accounting for its investment under the equity method of accounting due to the Company not maintaining control of Brightlane RECA, LP, which full control remains with the general partner, but having significant influence through its 99.99% limited partner interest. The consideration for the acquisition was 12,000,000 shares of common stock. The cost of the acquisition was determined according to ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions, whereby the cost of a nonmonetary asset acquired in exchange for another nonmonetary asset is the fair value of the asset surrendered or received, whichever is more clearly evident. The Company has determined that due to the inactive trading market of its common stock surrendered, the fair value of the asset received were more clearly evident.  The transaction was valued at the underlying value of the assets in the Brightlane RECA portfolio, net of the associated debt.        The Company determined the value to be the fair value of the unpaid principal balance of the individual purchase money notes and the fair value of the real estate owned, net of an underlying  defined  debt (which is defined in the original contribution agreement).  The fair value of the purchase money notes and real estate owned was $8,885,152 and the balance of the defined debt was $5,799,631 (resulting in a net value of $3,085,521) at the acquisition date of December 21, 2015.  According to the limited partner agreement, the general partner will recognize all income and receive all net cash flow from the Brightlane portfolio. Upon the company investing additional capital into Brightlane RECA LP, which will be used to pay the defined debt, the general partner will transfer 90% of its general partner interest to the Company.       NOTE 5   NOTES PAYABLE       On September 30, 2015 the Company borrowed $60,723 from a third party.  The note bears interest at 8% and is payable on demand. Interest is paid quarterly. The note is convertible into common stock of the Company at $0.50 per share.

Working Capital   
            Cash Flows   
                Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015          For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, total revenues were $72,484 and $0 respectively, with a net loss of $61,108 and a net income of $8,554 respectively.  The revenues for the period ended September 30, 2016 were as a result of the sale of a residential asset as well as the initial revenues from management fees generated by the newly formed Brightlife Management subsidiary.  The net losses were attributable to operating expenses of $122,367 and interest expenses of $11,225 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net income of $8,554 which was a result of other income from the extinguishing of certain accounts payable during the same period in 2015.

The operating expenses for the period ended September 30, 2016 were primarily general and administrative in nature and included legal fees, management and consulting fees, and audit and accounting fees as well as funds utilized to acquire new homes.            14        Table of Contents       Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015         For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, total revenues were $72,484 and $0 respectively, with a net loss of $257,051 and a net income of $1,333 respectively.

The net losses were attributable to operating and interest expenses and that primarily constituted expenses related to the reformulation of the Company s business model into a lease-to-own real estate model.  The operating expenses for the period ended September 30, 2016 were primarily general and administrative in nature and included legal fees, management and consulting fees, and audit and accounting fees as well as funds utilized to acquire new homes.        Liquidity and Capital Resources         Liquidity    At September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $298,166 and had working capital of $197,071.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $257,051.  We had a positive change of $5,172 due to accounts payable, a positive change of $19,287 due to accrued interest, and a negative change of $117,900 due to the acquisition of real estate consisting of five homes.  As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of $350,492 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net income of $1,333.  We had an adjustment of $484 due to depreciation expenses, and abandoned assets of $183.  We had a negative change of $42,723 due to accounts payable and a negative change of $20,000 due to accrued expenses.  As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of $60,723 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which was funded by a note payable of $60,723 to an unrelated party.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we spent $700 on the purchase of equipment, resulting in net cash used in investing activities of $700 for the period.  We did not pursue any investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.       For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received $609,200 as proceeds from a related party of which we repaid $165,000, and we also repaid a portion of a demand note payable of in the amount of $10,723.  As a result, we had net cash provided by financing activities of $433,477 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.         We had working capital at September 30, 2016 of $197,071 and working capital at December 31, 2015 of and $128,522 respectively. The increase in our working capital is attributed to the increase in raising capital offset by an increased activity in real estate acquisition of $117,900.            15        Table of Contents     The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources. We may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements.  While we have a best efforts commitment from the aforementioned accredited investor it is uncertain when such additional funding will be available and whether the terms will be acceptable to us. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed.       We have no known demands or commitments and are not aware of any events or uncertainties as of September 30, 2016, other than the work commitment previously mentioned, that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity.        Capital Resources    We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2016.        Off Balance Sheet Arrangements    There are no off balance sheet arrangements.         Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.        Not applicable because the Company is a smaller reporting company.         Item 4 . Controls and Procedures.         Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures        Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer who is also our Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer who is also our Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer who is also our Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors not currently having any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements.            16        Table of Contents      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting        Our management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation.                                                                                                         17            Table of Contents       PART II  - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings.        We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which our director, officer or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interests.        Item 1A.  Risk Factors.        Not applicable because the Company is a smaller reporting company.        Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.        1.
