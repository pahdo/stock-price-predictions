  NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  1. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  Basis of Presentation 
  J. C. Penney Company, Inc. is a holding company whose principal operating subsidiary is J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. (JCP). JCP was incorporated in   Delaware   in   1924  , and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in   2002  , when the holding company structure was implemented. The holding company has no independent assets or operations, and no direct subsidiaries other than JCP. The holding company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including JCP, are collectively referred to in this quarterly report as  we,   us,   our,   ourselves  or the  Company,  unless otherwise indicated. 
  J. C. Penney Company, Inc. is a co-obligor (or guarantor, as appropriate) regarding the payment of principal and interest on JCP s outstanding debt securities. The guarantee of certain of JCP s outstanding debt securities by J. C. Penney Company, Inc. is full and unconditional. 
  These unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The accompanying unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, in our opinion, include all material adjustments necessary for a fair presentation and should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   (  2015   Form 10-K). We follow substantially the same accounting policies to prepare quarterly financial statements as are followed in preparing annual financial statements. A description of such significant accounting policies is included in the   2015   Form 10-K. The   January 30, 2016   financial information was derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, with related footnotes, included in the   2015   Form 10-K. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. 
  Fiscal Year 
  Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31.  As used herein,  three months ended   October 29, 2016    and  three months ended   October 31, 2015    refer to the 13-week periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.   Nine months ended   October 29, 2016    and  nine months ended   October 31, 2015    refer to the 39-week periods ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively.  Fiscal years 2016 and 2015 contain 52 weeks. 
  Basis of Consolidation 
  All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

2.      Change in Accounting for Retirement-Related Benefits 
  In 2015, the Company elected to change its method of recognizing pension expense. Previously, for the primary and supplemental pension plans, net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans  projected benefit obligation (the corridor) were recognized over the remaining service period of plan participants (eight years for the primary pension plan). Under the Company s new accounting method, the Company recognizes changes in net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor annually in the fourth quarter each year (Mark-to-market Adjustment). The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, will be recorded on a quarterly basis. While the historical policy of recognizing pension expense was considered acceptable, the Company believes that the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognition of actuarial gains and losses outside the corridor. 
    
  This change has been reported through retrospective application of the new policy to all periods presented. The impacts of all adjustments made to the financial statements are summarized below:

3. Effect of New Accounting Standards 
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   (ASU 2016-09).  ASU 2016-09 will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled (i.e., additional paid-in capital or APIC pools will be eliminated).  The guidance on employers  accounting for an employee s use of shares to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation and for forfeitures is changing. The ASU also provides a practical expedient for public companies that will allow the use of a simplified method to estimate the expected term for certain awards. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)   (ASU 2016-05).  Under the ASU, the novation of a derivative contract (i.e., a change in the counterparty) in a hedge accounting relationship does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedge accounting relationship.  The hedge accounting relationship could continue uninterrupted if all of the other hedge accounting criteria are met, including the expectation that the hedge will be highly effective when the creditworthiness of the new counterparty to the derivative contract is considered.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein.  Early adoption is permitted.  Entities may apply the guidance prospectively or on a modified retrospective basis.  We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)   (ASU 2016-15).  ASU 2016-15 clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows.  The guidance also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein.  Early adoption is permitted.  Entities should apply the guidance retrospectively, but if it is impracticable to do so for an issue, the amendments related to that issue may be applied prospectively.  We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

5. Long-Term Debt 

(1) 
    These debt issuances contain a change of control provision that would obligate us, at the holders  option, to repurchase the debt at a price of 101%. 
       
  During the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased and retired   $60 million   aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of   $4 million  . 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we completed the refinancing of our   $2.25 billion   five-year senior secured term loan facility entered into in 2013 (2013 Term Loan Facility) with an amended and restated   $1.688 billion   seven-year senior secured term loan credit facility (2016 Term Loan Facility) and the issuance of   $500 million   of 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (Senior Secured Notes), resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of   $34 million  . 
    
  The 2016 Term Loan Facility bears interest at a rate of LIBOR (subject to a 1% floor) plus   4.25%   and matures on June 23, 2023.  We are required to make quarterly repayments in a principal amount equal to   $10.55 million   during the seven-year term, subject to certain reductions for mandatory and optional prepayments. Proceeds from the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the Senior Secured Notes were used to repay the entire outstanding principal balance of the 2013 Term Loan Facility.  The 2016 Term Loan facility and the Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries of JCP and are secured by mortgages on certain real estate of JCP and the guarantors. 
   
  6. Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  We use derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates.  Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects us to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative instrument will change.  In a hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item.  Credit risk related to derivatives represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract.  The notional, or contractual, amount of our derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

represent our exposure due to credit risk.  Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral (generally cash) from the counterparty when appropriate.   
    
  When we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging our exposure to interest rates, the contract terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation.  Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting.  If a derivative instrument is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings during the period.  Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which we have not elected hedge accounting, are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of change. 
    
  We have entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling   $1,250 million   to fix a portion of our variable LIBOR-based interest payments.  The interest rate swap agreements have a weighted-average fixed rate of   2.04%  , mature on May 7, 2020 and have been designated as cash flow hedges.   
    
  The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded on the unaudited Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets as an asset or a liability (see Note 7).  The effective portion of the interest rate swaps' changes in fair values is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 8), and the ineffective portion is reported in Net income/(loss).  Amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) are reclassified into net income/(loss) when the related interest payments affect earnings.  For the periods presented, all of the interest rate swaps were   100%   effective. 
  Information regarding the gross amounts of our derivative instruments in the unaudited Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:

Table of Contents  

7. Fair Value Disclosures 
  In determining fair value, the accounting standards establish a three level hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2   Significant observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, such as quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    Level 3   Significant unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. 
     Cash Flow Hedges Measured on a Recurring Basis 
  The   $31 million  ,   $21 million   and   $30 million   fair value of our cash flow hedges as of   October 29, 2016  ,   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , respectively, are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques which use quoted market interest rates in discounted cash flow calculations which consider the instrument's term, notional amount, discount rate and credit risk.  Significant inputs to the derivative valuation for interest rate swaps are observable in the active markets and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. 
    
  Other Financial Instruments 
  Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the unaudited Interim Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows: 

The fair value of long-term debt was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers or was based on current rates offered for similar debt. As of   October 29, 2016  ,   October 31, 2015   and   January 30, 2016  , the fair values of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximated their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. In addition, the fair values of capital lease commitments and the note payable approximated their carrying values. These items have been excluded from the table above. 
  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  We have no significant concentrations of credit risk. 
   
  8. Stockholders  Equity

9. Retirement Benefit Plans 
  The components of net periodic benefit expense/(income) for our non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (Primary Pension Plan) and non-contributory supplemental pension plans were as follows:   

  Additionally, the Company had net periodic postretirement income of   $6 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, in the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   and net periodic postretirement income of   $14 million   and   $6 million  , respectively, in the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  .  These amounts are related to the Company's noncontributory postretirement health and welfare plan and are included in SG A expense in the unaudited Interim Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company communicated to plan participants that the postretirement health and welfare plan will terminate by December 2016 and this resulted in a reduction of the accumulated plan benefit obligation from   $8 million   at January 30, 2016 to   $1 million   at October 29, 2016.

Non-cash amounts represent charges that do not result in cash outflows. 
   
  11. Real Estate and Other, Net 
  Real estate and other consists of ongoing operating income from our real estate subsidiaries.  Real estate and other also includes net gains from the sale of facilities and equipment that are no longer used in operations, asset impairments, accruals for certain litigation and other non-operating charges and credits.  In addition, during the first quarter of 2014, we entered into a joint venture in which we contributed approximately   220   acres of excess property adjacent to our home office facility in Plano, Texas (Home Office Land Joint Venture).  The joint venture was formed to develop the contributed property and our proportional share of the joint venture's activities is recorded in Real estate and other, net.

Investment Income from Joint Ventures 
  During the first   nine   months of 2016, the Company had   $29 million   in income related to its proportional share of the net income in the Home Office Land Joint Venture and received an aggregate cash distribution of   $44 million  .  During the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2015, the Company had   $19 million   and   $41 million  , respectively, in income related to its proportional share of the net income in the Home Office Land Joint Venture and, during the first nine months of 2015, received an aggregate cash distribution of   $22 million  . 
    
  Other 
  During the third quarter of 2015, the Company accrued an additional   $20 million   under the settlement related to the pricing class action litigation.  Pursuant to the settlement, class members will have the option of selecting a cash payment or store credit.  The amount of the payment or credit will depend on the total amount of certain merchandise purchased by each class member during the class period. 
   
  12. Income Taxes 
  The net tax expense of   $3 million   for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   consisted of state and foreign tax expenses of   $3 million   and   $2 million   of expense related to the deferred tax asset change arising from the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets, offset by a   $2 million   net tax benefit to adjust the valuation allowance. 
  The net tax expense of   $7 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   consisted of state and foreign tax expenses of   $10 million   and   $5 million   of expense related to the deferred tax asset change arising from the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets, offset by net tax benefits of   $6 million   to adjust the valuation allowance and   $2 million   for state audit settlements. 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we have approximately   $2.6 billion   of net operating losses (NOLs) available for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which expire in 2032 through 2034 and   $60 million   of tax credit carryforwards that expire at various dates through 2035.  For these NOL and tax credit carryforwards a net deferred tax asset of   $86 million   has been recorded, net of a valuation allowance of   $845 million  .  A valuation allowance of   $242 million   fully offsets the deferred tax assets resulting from the state NOL carryforwards that expire at various dates through 2034.  In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we considered both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets.  As a result of our periodic assessment, our estimate of the realization of deferred tax assets is solely based on the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies that we would make use of to accelerate taxable income to utilize expiring NOL and tax credit carryforwards.  Accordingly, in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2016, the valuation allowance was increased by   $30 million   and   $62 million  , respectively, to offset the net deferred tax assets created in those periods relating primarily to the increase in NOL carryforwards. 
   
  13. Litigation and Other Contingencies 
  Litigation 
  Macy s Litigation 
  On August 16, 2012, Macy s, Inc. and Macy s Merchandising Group, Inc. (together the Plaintiffs) filed suit against JCP in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleging that the Company tortiously interfered with, and engaged in unfair competition relating to, a 2006 agreement between Macy s and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. (MSLO) by entering into a partnership agreement with MSLO in December 2011. The Plaintiffs sought primarily to prevent the Company from implementing our partnership agreement with MSLO as it related to products in the bedding, bath, kitchen and cookware categories. The suit was consolidated with an already-existing breach of contract lawsuit by the Plaintiffs against

     Table of Contents  

MSLO, and a bench trial commenced on February 20, 2013. On October 21, 2013, the Company and MSLO entered into an amendment of the partnership agreement, providing in part that the Company will not sell MSLO-designed merchandise in the bedding, bath, kitchen and cookware categories. On January 2, 2014, MSLO and Macy's announced that they had settled the case as to each other, and MSLO was subsequently dismissed as a defendant. On June 16, 2014, the court issued a ruling against the Company on the remaining claim of intentional interference, and held that Macy s is not entitled to punitive damages. The court referred other issues related to damages to a Judicial Hearing Officer. On June 30, 2014, the Company appealed the court s decision, and Macy s cross-appealed a portion of the decision. On February 26, 2015, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's rulings concerning the claim of intentional interference and lack of punitive damages, and reinstated Macy's claims for intentional interference and unfair competition that had been dismissed during trial. On June 17, 2015, Macy s appealed the court s order that the Judicial Hearing Officer proceed with the damages phase of the proceedings on the tortious interference claim. On November 24, 2015, the Judicial Hearing Officer issued a recommendation on the amount of damages to be awarded to Macy s. On June 6, 2016, the court adopted the Judicial Hearing Officer's recommendation on the amount of damages to be awarded to Macy's. Both parties have filed a notice of appeal. On November 10, 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling affirming the court's order, finding Macy s challenge to the measure of damages to be untimely. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, we believe that the final resolution of this action will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources. 
    
  Class Action Securities Litigation 
  The Company, Myron E. Ullman, III and Kenneth H. Hannah are parties to the Marcus consolidated purported class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division. The Marcus consolidated complaint is purportedly brought on behalf of persons who acquired our common stock during the period from August 20, 2013 through September 26, 2013, and alleges claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Plaintiff claims that the defendants made false and misleading statements and/or omissions regarding the Company s financial condition and business prospects that caused our common stock to trade at artificially inflated prices.  The consolidated complaint seeks class certification, unspecified compensatory damages, including interest, reasonable costs and expenses, and other relief as the court may deem just and proper. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint which was denied by the court on September 29, 2015. Defendants filed an answer to the consolidated complaint on November 12, 2015. Plaintiff filed a motion for class certification on January 25, 2016, and defendants submitted a response to the motion on April 15, 2016. On August 29, 2016, a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the motion for class certification be granted. Defendants have filed objections to the report and recommendation. 
    
  Also, on August 26, 2014, plaintiff Nathan Johnson filed a purported class action lawsuit against the Company, Myron E. Ullman, III and Kenneth H. Hannah in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division. The suit is purportedly brought on behalf of persons who acquired our securities other than common stock during the period from August 20, 2013 through September 26, 2013, generally mirrors the allegations contained in the Marcus lawsuit discussed above, and seeks similar relief. On June 8, 2015, plaintiff in the Marcus lawsuit amended the consolidated complaint to include the members of the purported class in the Johnson lawsuit, and on June 10, 2015, the Johnson lawsuit was consolidated into the Marcus lawsuit. 
    
  We believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend them. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of these matters, we believe that the final resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources. 
    
  Shareholder Derivative Litigation 
  In October, 2013, two purported shareholder derivative actions were filed against certain present and former members of the Company s Board of Directors and executives by the following parties in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division: Weitzman (filed October 2, 2013) and Zauderer (filed October 3, 2013). The Company is named as a nominal defendant in both suits. The lawsuits assert claims for breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment based upon alleged false and misleading statements and/or omissions regarding the Company s financial condition. The lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement by the defendants of all profits, benefits and other compensation, equitable relief to reform the Company s corporate governance and internal procedures, reasonable costs and expenses, and other relief as the court may deem just and proper. On October 28, 2013, the Court consolidated the two cases into the Weitzman lawsuit. On January 15, 2014, the Court entered an order staying the derivative suits pending certain events in the class action securities litigation described above. 
    
  Also, in March 2016, plaintiff Frank Lipsius filed a purported shareholder derivative action against certain present and former members of the Company's Board of Directors and executives in the District Court of Collin County in the State of Texas. The Company is named as a nominal defendant in the suit. The suit generally mirrors the allegations contained in the Weitzman and Zauderer suits discussed above, and seeks similar relief.

  ERISA Class Action Litigation 
  JCP and certain present and former members of JCP's Board of Directors have been sued in a purported class action complaint by plaintiffs Roberto Ramirez and Thomas Ihle, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, which was filed on July 8, 2014 in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division. The suit alleges that the defendants violated Section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by breaching fiduciary duties relating to the J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. Savings, Profit-Sharing and Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan). The class period is alleged to be between November 1, 2011 and September 27, 2013. Plaintiffs allege that they and others who invested in or held Company stock in the Plan during this period were injured because defendants allegedly made false and misleading statements and/or omissions regarding the Company s financial condition and business prospects that caused the Company s common stock to trade at artificially inflated prices. The complaint seeks class certification, declaratory relief, a constructive trust, reimbursement of alleged losses to the Plan, actual damages, attorneys  fees and costs, and other relief. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint which was granted in part and denied in part by the court on September 29, 2015. The parties have reached a settlement agreement, subject to court approval, pursuant to which JCP would make available   $4.5 million   to settle class members  claims. While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of this matter, we believe that the final resolution of this action will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources. 
    
  Employment Class Action Litigation 
  JCP is a defendant in a class action proceeding entitled   Tschudy v. JCPenney Corporation   filed on April 15, 2011 in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of California. The lawsuit alleges that JCP violated the California Labor Code in connection with the alleged forfeiture of accrued and vested vacation time under its  My Time Off  policy. The class consists of all JCP employees who worked in California from April 5, 2007 to the present. Plaintiffs amended the complaint to assert additional claims under the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act on behalf of all JCP employees who worked in Illinois from January 1, 2004 to the present. After the court granted JCP s motion to transfer the Illinois claims, those claims are now pending in a separate action in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, entitled   Garcia v. JCPenney Corporation  . The lawsuits seek compensatory damages, penalties, interest, disgorgement, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorney s fees and costs. Plaintiffs in both lawsuits filed motions, which the Company opposed, to certify these actions on behalf of all employees in California and Illinois based on the specific claims at issue. On December 17, 2014, the California court granted plaintiffs  motion for class certification. Pursuant to a motion by the Company, the California court decertified the class on December 9, 2015. On March 30, 2016, the California court granted JCP s motion for summary judgment. On April 26, 2016, the California plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On May 4, 2016, the California court entered judgment for JCP on all plaintiffs  claims. The Illinois court denied without prejudice plaintiffs' motion for class certification pending the filing of an amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint in the Illinois lawsuit on April 14, 2015 and the Company has answered. On July 2, 2015, the Illinois plaintiffs renewed their motion for class certification, which the Illinois court granted on March 8, 2016. The parties have reached a settlement agreement, subject to court approval, to resolve the California and Illinois actions for a combined total of   $6.75 million  . While no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of these matters, we believe that the final resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources. 
    
  Pricing Class Action Litigation 
  JCP is a defendant in a class action proceeding entitled   Spann v. J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc.   filed on February 8, 2012 in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California. The lawsuit alleges that JCP violated California s Unfair Competition Law and related state statutes in connection with its advertising of sale prices for private label apparel and accessories. The lawsuit seeks restitution, damages, injunctive relief, and attorney s fees and costs. On May 18, 2015, the court granted plaintiff's request for certification of a class consisting of all people who, between November 5, 2010 and January 31, 2012, made purchases in California of JCP private or exclusive label apparel or accessories advertised at a discount of at least 30% off the stated original or regular price (excluding those who only received such discount by using coupon(s)), and who have not received a refund or credit for their purchases. The parties reached a settlement agreement, and in accordance with the terms of the settlement, we have established a   $50 million   reserve to settle class members' claims. The court granted final approval of the settlement on September 30, 2016. 
    
  Other Legal Proceedings 
  We are subject to various other legal and governmental proceedings involving routine litigation incidental to our business. Accruals have been established based on our best estimates of our potential liability in certain of these matters, including certain matters discussed above, all of which we believe aggregate to an amount that is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates were developed in consultation with in-house and outside counsel. While no assurance

     Table of Contents  

can be given as to the ultimate outcome of these matters, we currently believe that the final resolution of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources. 
  Contingencies 
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we estimated our total potential environmental liabilities to range from   $20 million   to   $26 million   and recorded our best estimate of   $24 million   in Other accounts payable and accrued expenses and Other liabilities in the unaudited Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date. This estimate covered potential liabilities primarily related to underground storage tanks, remediation of environmental conditions involving our former drugstore locations and asbestos removal in connection with approved plans to renovate or dispose of our facilities. We continue to assess required remediation and the adequacy of environmental reserves as new information becomes available and known conditions are further delineated. If we were to incur losses at the upper end of the estimated range, we do not believe that such losses would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity or capital resources.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  General 
  J. C. Penney Company, Inc. is a holding company whose principal operating subsidiary is J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. (JCP). JCP was incorporated in Delaware in 1924, and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2002, when the holding company structure was implemented. The holding company has no independent assets or operations and no direct subsidiaries other than JCP. The holding company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including JCP, are collectively referred to in this quarterly report as  we,   us,   our,   ourselves  or the  Company,  unless otherwise indicated. 
  The holding company is a co-obligor (or guarantor, as appropriate) regarding the payment of principal and interest on JCP s outstanding debt securities. The guarantee of certain of JCP s outstanding debt securities by the holding company is full and unconditional. 
  This discussion is intended to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, how operating results affect the financial condition and results of operations of our Company as a whole, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the financial statements. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of   January 30, 2016  , and for the year then ended, and related Notes, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A), all contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   January 30, 2016   (2015 Form 10-K). Unless otherwise indicated, all references to earnings/(loss) per share (EPS) are on a diluted basis and all references to years relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years. 

Strategic Framework 
    
  Our strategic framework is built upon the three pillars of private brands, omnichannel and revenue per customer. 
    
  Product differentiation, affordable style and quality and enhanced profitability are critical to the success of our private brands.  With our team of designers and our proprietary designs, we believe we can differentiate our private and exclusive brands from our competitors and the overall marketplace. Through our private brand selection, we believe we can provide value to our customers by offering products with style and quality at an attractive price point.  Lastly, with our global sourcing infrastructure, we believe we are uniquely positioned to enhance our merchandise margins by managing product development costs and maintaining flexibility with our price offerings.  During the   third   quarters of both 2016 and 2015, private brand merchandise comprised 44% of total merchandise sales.  For the first nine months of 2016, private brand merchandise comprised 45% of total merchandise sales as compared to 44% in the corresponding prior year period.  During the   third   quarters of 2016 and 2015, exclusive brand merchandise comprised 8% and 9%, respectively, of total merchandise sales.  For the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, exclusive brand merchandise comprised 8% and 10%, respectively, of total merchandise sales. 
    
  Our second strategic area of focus is omnichannel.  With our heritage of being a catalog retailer, we believe we have the right foundation in place to enhance our omnichannel capabilities.  Today s customer wants to decide when and how she wants to shop, whether in store or online using multiple personal devices.  Improving the omnichannel experience for our customers involves further development of our mobile apps, providing more fulfillment choices to the customer and expanding our merchandise assortment. 
    
  Our final strategic priority is revenue per customer.  For 2016, we are focused on the following initiatives to increase the frequency of customer visits and the amount they spend on every transaction.  First, we plan to accelerate our growth of Sephora inside JCPenney locations.  During the first nine months of 2016, we opened 60 additional Sephora locations, bringing our total number of locations to 578, and we launched several new brands in our Sephora shops.  Second, we continue to enhance our salon environment through our rebranding initiative in partnership with InStyle magazine.  Third, we have redesigned the center core area, which includes fashion and fine jewelry, handbags, footwear, sunglasses, and accessories, in approximately 350 of our stores this year.  Fourth is our new home initiative.  With the current trend of consumer investment in new and existing homes, we believe there is an opportunity for us to add to our offerings a compelling assortment within major appliances, window treatments, furniture and flooring.  We have expanded our major appliance initiatives to over 500 stores and online at jcpenney.com this year, and continue to enhance our window coverings presentation and test new initiatives with Ashley Furniture and Empire Today.

    Comparable store sales include sales from all stores, including sales from services and commissions earned from our in-store licensed departments, that have been open for 12 consecutive full fiscal months and Internet sales.  Stores closed for an extended period are not included in comparable store sales calculations, while stores remodeled and minor expansions not requiring store closure remain in the     calculations.  Certain items, such as sales return estimates and store liquidation sales, are excluded from the Company s calculation.  Our definition and calculation of comparable store sales may differ from other companies in the retail industry.

Total Net Sales 

Total net sales   decreased     $40 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to the   third   quarter of 2015.  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , total net sales   decreased     $43 million   from the same period last year. 
    
  The following table provides the components of the net sales increase/(decrease):    

As our omnichannel strategy continues to mature, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between a store sale and an Internet sale.  Because we no longer have a clear distinction between store sales and Internet sales, we do not separately report Internet sales.  Below is a list of some of our omnichannel activities:  
             
    Stores increase Internet sales by providing customers opportunities to view, touch and/or try on physical merchandise before ordering online.  
                
    Our website increases store sales as in-store customers have often pre-shopped online before shopping in the store, including verification of which stores have online merchandise in stock.  
                
    Most Internet purchases are easily returned in our stores.  
                
    JCP Rewards can be earned and redeemed online or in stores. 
                
    In-store customers can order from our website with the assistance of associates in our stores or they can shop our website from the JCPenney app while inside the store. 
                
    Customers who utilize our mobile application can receive mobile coupons to use when they check out both online or in our stores. 
                
    Internet orders can be shipped from a dedicated jcpenney.com fulfillment center, a store, a store merchandise distribution center, a regional warehouse, directly from vendors or any combination of the above. 
                
    Certain categories of store inventory can be accessed and purchased by jcpenney.com customers and shipped directly to the customer's home from the store. 
                
    Internet orders can be shipped to stores for customer pick up. 
                
    "Buy online and pick up in store same day" is now available in all of our stores. 
       
  For the three months ended   October 29, 2016  , comparable store sales   decreased     0.8%  , while total net sales   decreased     1.4%   to   $2,857 million   compared with   $2,897 million   for the three months ended   October 31, 2015  .  For the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , comparable store sales   increased     0.3%  , while total net sales   decreased     0.5%   to   $8,586 million   compared with   $8,629 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015  . 
    
  For the third quarter of 2016, average unit retail increased while conversion rate, units per transaction and transaction counts all decreased as compared to the prior year.  For the first   nine   months of 2016, conversion rate and units per transaction increased     while transaction counts and average unit retail decreased as compared to the prior year.

For the   third   quarter of 2016, Sephora, Home and Fine Jewelry were our top-performing merchandise divisions all experiencing sales gains on a comparable store basis.  For the first nine months of 2016, our top-performing merchandise divisions were Sephora, Home, Footwear and Handbags and Men's.  Geographically, the Pacific and Northwest were the best performing regions of the country during the   third   quarter of 2016.  The Pacific, Northeast and Northwest regions performed the best during the first nine months of 2016. 
  Store Count 
  The following table compares the number of stores for the   three and nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  :    

Gross Margin 
  Gross margin for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   was   $1,062 million  , a   decrease   of   $20 million   compared to   $1,082 million   for the three months ended   October 31, 2015  .  Gross margin as a percentage of sales for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   was   37.2%   compared to   37.3%   for the three months ended   October 31, 2015  .  The slight decline in the gross margin rate was primarily due to lower Internet and major appliance selling margins and higher clearance markdowns. 
    
  Gross margin for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   was   $3,164 million  , a   decrease   of   $24 million   compared to   $3,188 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015  .  Gross margin as a percentage of sales was   36.9%   for both the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  . 
    
  SG A Expenses 
  For the three months ended   October 29, 2016  , SG A expenses were   $59 million     lower   than the corresponding period of 2015.  As a percent of sales, SG A expenses   decreased   to   31.1%   compared to   32.7%   in the   third   quarter of 2015.  Through the first   nine   months of 2016, SG A expenses were   $200 million     lower   than the corresponding period of 2015.  Through the first   nine   months of 2016, as a percent of sales, SG A expenses   decreased   to   30.4%   compared to   32.6%   in the corresponding period of   2015  , reflecting effective management of SG A expenses.  The net   decrease   in SG A expenses for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016 as compared to the corresponding prior year periods was primarily driven by lower store controllable costs and corporate overhead, reduced incentive compensation, more efficient advertising spend and improved private label credit card income. 
    
  Our private label credit card and co-branded MasterCard  programs are owned and serviced by Synchrony Financial (Synchrony).  Under our agreement with Synchrony, we receive cash payments from Synchrony based upon the performance of the credit card portfolio.  We participate in the programs by providing marketing promotions designed to increase the use of each card, including enhanced marketing offers for cardholders.  Additionally, we accept payments in our stores from cardholders who prefer to pay in person when they are shopping in our locations.  The income we earn under our agreement with Synchrony is included as an offset to SG A expenses.  For the   third   quarters of 2016 and 2015, we recognized income of $81 million and $75 million, respectively, pursuant to our private label credit card program.  Through the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, we recognized income of $235 million and $216 million, respectively.

Pension Expense 
  Pension expense/(income) provided below reflects the retrospective application of the change in our method of recognizing pension expense.  See Note 2 of Notes to unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of this change and related impacts. 

Total pension expense, which consists of expense/(income) from our Primary Pension Plan and our supplemental pension plans, is based on our   2015   year-end measurement of pension plan assets and benefit obligations.  For the   third   quarter of 2016, our Primary Pension Plan had   income   of   $0 million   compared to   income   of   $19 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015.  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , our Primary Pension Plan had   income   of   $0 million   compared to   income   of   $57 million   in the prior year corresponding period.  The year-over-year decrease in income for our Primary Pension Plan was primarily driven by the lower expected return on assets estimated to cover the pension costs to be incurred. 
  Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
  Depreciation and amortization expense was   $149 million   and   $152 million   for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively, and   $456 million   and   $459 million   for the nine months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Restructuring and Management Transition 
  The composition of restructuring and management transition charges was as follows:    

During the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , we recorded   $6 million   and   $38 million  , respectively, of costs to reduce our store and home office expenses.  Costs during the first nine months of 2016 primarily include employee termination benefits in connection with the elimination of positions in our home office.  During the first   nine   months of 2015, we incurred charges of $24 million related to employee termination benefits and lease termination costs associated with the closure of 41 stores.  Additionally, during the first nine months of 2015, we incurred $14 million related to employee termination benefits in connection with the elimination of approximately 300 positions in our home office. 
    
  We also implemented changes within our management leadership team during the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015   that resulted in management transition costs of   $3 million   and   $10 million  , respectively, for both incoming and outgoing members of management. 
    
  Other miscellaneous restructuring charges of   $8 million   and   $5 million  , primarily related to contract termination and other costs associated with our previous shops strategy and costs related to the closure of certain supply chain locations, were recorded during the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and   October 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Real Estate and Other, Net 
  Real estate and other consists of ongoing operating income from our real estate subsidiaries.  Real estate and other also includes net gains from the sale of facilities and equipment that are no longer used in operations, asset impairments, accruals for certain litigation and other non-operating charges and credits.  In addition, during the first quarter of 2014, we entered into a joint venture in which we contributed approximately   220   acres of excess property adjacent to our home office facility in Plano, Texas (the Home Office Land Joint Venture).  The joint venture was formed to develop the contributed property and our proportional share of the joint venture's activities is recorded in Real estate and other, net. 
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

The composition of Real estate and other, net was as follows:   

During the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, we sold non-operating assets for a net gain of $5 million and $9 million, respectively.  Investment income from the Home Office Land Joint Venture represents our proportional share of net income from the joint venture. 
    
  During the first nine months of 2016, the net gain from the sale of operating assets related primarily to     the sale of land adjacent to our home office not contributed to the Home Office Land Joint Venture.      During the first nine months of 2015, the net gain from the sale of operating assets related primarily to     the sale of a former furniture store location and payments received from landlords to terminate two leases prior to the original expiration date. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, the Company accrued an additional $20 million under the settlement related to the 
  pricing class action litigation. Pursuant to the settlement, class members will have the option of selecting a cash payment or store credit. The amount of the payment or credit will depend on the total amount of certain merchandise purchased by each class member during the class period. 
    
  Operating Income/(Loss) 
  For the   third   quarter of 2016, we reported operating income of   $23 million   compared to an operating loss of   $16 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015.  For the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , we reported operating income of   $121 million   compared to an operating loss of   $71 million   in the prior year corresponding period, reflecting better operating performance achieved by the Company. 
    
  (Gain)/Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased and retired $60 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $4 million. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we completed the refinancing of our $2.25 billion five-year senior secured term loan facility entered into in 2013 (2013 Term Loan Facility) with an amended and restated $1.688 billion seven-year senior secured term loan credit facility (2016 Term Loan Facility) and the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2023, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $34 million. 
    
  Net Interest Expense 
  Net interest expense for the   third   quarters of 2016 and 2015 was   $87 million   and   $102 million  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , net interest expense was   $275 million   compared to   $303 million   in the prior year corresponding period.  The reduction in net interest expense is due to lower debt levels in 2016 compared to 2015. 
  Income Taxes 
  The net tax expense of   $3 million   for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   consisted of state and foreign tax expenses of   $3 million   and   $2 million   of expense related to the deferred tax asset change arising from the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets, offset by a   $2 million   net tax benefit to adjust the valuation allowance. 
    
  The net tax expense of   $7 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   consisted of state and foreign tax expenses of   $10 million   and   $5 million   of expense related to the deferred tax asset change arising from the tax amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets, offset by net tax benefits of   $6 million   to adjust the valuation allowance and   $2 million   for state audit settlements.  
  As of   October 29, 2016  , we have approximately   $2.6 billion   of net operating losses (NOLs) available for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which expire in 2032 through 2034 and   $60 million   of tax credit carryforwards that expire at various dates through 2035.  For these NOL and tax credit carryforwards a net deferred tax asset of   $86 million   has been recorded, net of a  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents  

valuation allowance of   $845 million  .  A valuation allowance of   $242 million   fully offsets the deferred tax assets resulting from the state NOL carryforwards that expire at various dates through 2034.  In assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we considered both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets.  As a result of our periodic assessment, our estimate of the realization of deferred tax assets is solely based on the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies that we would make use of to accelerate taxable income to utilize expiring NOL and tax credit carryforwards.  Accordingly, in the   third   quarter and first   nine   months of 2016, the valuation allowance was increased by   $30 million   and   $62 million  , respectively, to offset the net deferred tax assets created in those periods relating primarily to the increase in NOL carryforwards. 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We report our financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). However, we present certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to assess our results. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful in order to better understand our financial performance as well as to facilitate the comparison of our results to the results of our peer companies. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assess the results of our operations. It is important to view non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, those measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have provided reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP measures to our non-GAAP financial measures presented. 
    
  The following non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude restructuring and management transition charges, the impact of our Primary Pension Plan, the (gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt, the net gain on the sale of non-operating assets and the proportional share of net income from our Home Office Land Joint Venture.  Unlike other operating expenses, restructuring and management transition charges, the (gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt, the net gain on the sale of non-operating assets and the proportional share of net income from our Home Office Land Joint Venture are not directly related to our ongoing core business operations, which consist of selling merchandise and services to consumers through our department stores and our website at jcpenney.com.  Primary Pension Plan expense/(income) is determined using numerous complex assumptions about changes in pension assets and liabilities that are subject to factors beyond our control, such as market volatility.  Accordingly, we eliminate our Primary Pension Plan expense/(income) in its entirety as we view all components of net periodic benefit expense/(income) as a single, net amount, consistent with its presentation in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  We believe it is useful for investors to understand the impact of restructuring and management transition charges, Primary Pension Plan expense/(income), the (gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt, the net gain on the sale of non-operating assets and the proportional share of net income from the Home Office Land Joint Venture on our financial results and therefore are presenting the following non-GAAP financial measures: (1) adjusted EBITDA; (2) adjusted net income/(loss); and (3) adjusted earnings/(loss) per share-diluted.  
    
  In addition, we believe that EBITDA is a useful measure in assessing our operating performance and are therefore presenting this non-GAAP financial measure in addition to the non-GAAP financial measures listed above.

    Reflects the retrospective application of the change in our method of recognizing pension expense.  See Note 2 of Notes to unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the change and related impacts.  For the three months ended   October 31, 2015  , the retrospective application of the change in recognizing pension expense increased EBITDA (non-GAAP) by $29 million and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) by $3 million.  For the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015  , the retrospective application of the change in recognizing pension expense increased EBITDA (non-GAAP) by $87 million and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) by $10 million. 
       
  For the three months ended   October 29, 2016  , EBITDA was   $172 million  , an improvement of $36 million compared to EBITDA of   $136 million   in the prior year corresponding period.  Excluding restructuring and management transition charges, the impact of our Primary Pension Plan expense/(income), the net gain on the sale of non-operating assets, and the proportional share of net income from the Home Office Land Joint Venture, adjusted EBITDA improved $63 million to   $174 million   for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to   $111 million   for the prior year corresponding period. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , EBITDA was   $577 million  , an improvement of $189 million compared to   $388 million   in the prior year corresponding period.  Excluding restructuring and management transition charges, the impact of our Primary Pension Plan expense/(income), the net gain on the sale of non-operating assets, and the proportional share of net income from the Home Office Land Joint Venture, adjusted EBITDA improved $226 million to   $560 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   compared to   $334 million   for the prior year corresponding period. 
    
  Overall, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA improved significantly for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   as compared to the corresponding prior year period as we effectively managed our gross margin performance as a percentage of sales and controllable expenses.  For the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  , EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA improved significantly as compared to the corresponding prior year period as we recorded positive comparable store sales, maintained our gross margin performance as a percentage of sales and effectively managed our controllable expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Overview 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and access to our revolving credit facility.  Our cash flows may be impacted by many factors including the economic environment, consumer confidence, competitive conditions in the retail industry and the success of our strategies.  We ended the   third   quarter of   2016   with   $183 million   of cash and cash equivalents.  As of the end of the   third   quarter of   2016  , based on our borrowing base, our current borrowings and amounts reserved for outstanding letters of credit, we had   $1,767 million   available for future borrowings under our revolving credit facility, providing total available liquidity of   $1,950 million  . 
  The following table provides a summary of our key components and ratios of financial condition and liquidity: 

(1) 
    Total debt includes long-term debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, including current maturities, capital leases, note payable and any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
              (2) 
    See  Free Cash Flow  below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and further information on its uses and limitations. 
               (4) 
    Total debt divided by total capitalization. 
              (5) 
    Cash and cash equivalents divided by total debt. 
       
  Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP) 
  Free cash flow is a key financial measure of our ability to generate additional cash from operating our business and in evaluating our financial performance. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures  plus the proceeds from the sale of operating assets. Free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt, revise our dividend policy or fund other uses of capital that we believe will enhance stockholder value. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the rules of the SEC. Free cash flow is limited and does not represent remaining cash flow available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct payments required for debt maturities, pay-down of pension debt, and other obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, it is important to view free cash flow in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, our entire statement of cash flows and those measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as well as information regarding net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities and net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities: 

(2) 
    Net cash provided by investing activities includes capital expenditures and proceeds from sale of operating assets, which are also included in our computation of free cash flow. 
     Operating Activities 
  While a significant portion of our sales, profit and operating cash flows have historically been realized in the fourth quarter, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors, including seasonal fluctuations in customer demand, product offerings, inventory levels and promotional activity. 
  Cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended   October 29, 2016     improved     $39 million   to an   outflow   of   $193 million   compared to an   outflow   of   $232 million   for the same period in 2015.  Cash flow from operating activities for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016     improved     $15 million   to an   outflow   of   $401 million   compared to an   outflow   of   $416 million   for the same period in 2015.  Our net loss of   $191 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   includes significant income and expense items that do not impact operating cash flow including depreciation and amortization, the gain on the sale of assets and stock-based compensation.  The overall decrease in cash used in operations for the nine month period was primarily due to our positive operating performance and successful inventory management that was offset by higher incentive compensation payments. 
  Cash flows from operating activities for the first   nine   months of 2016 also included construction allowances from landlords of $11 million, which funded a portion of our capital expenditures in investing activities. 
  Merchandise inventory   increased     $22 million   to   $3,691 million  , or   0.6%  , as of the end of the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $3,669 million   as of the end of the   third   quarter last year and increased $970 million from year-end 2015.  Merchandise accounts payable increased $40 million as of the end of the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the corresponding prior year period and increased $568 million from year end. 
  Investing Activities 
  Investing activities for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   resulted in cash   outflow  s of   $122 million   compared to   outflow  s of   $92 million   for the same three month period of   2015  .  Investing activities through the first   nine   months of 2016 resulted in cash   outflow  s of   $249 million   compared to   outflow  s of   $215 million   for the same   nine   month period of   2015  . 
  Cash capital expenditures were   $282 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   and were   $234 million   for the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015  . In addition, as of the end of the   third   quarters of   2016   and 2015, we had   $46 million   and   $21 million  , respectively, of accrued capital expenditures.  Through the first   nine   months of 2016, capital expenditures related primarily to the roll out of over 500 appliance showrooms, the roll out of our center core concept in 350 locations, the opening of 60 Sephora inside JCPenney stores, other investments in our store environment and store facility improvements and investments in information technology in both our home office and stores.  We received construction allowances from landlords of $11 million in the first   nine   months of 2016 to fund a portion of the capital expenditures related to store leasehold  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

improvements.  These funds are classified as operating activities and have been recorded as deferred rent credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized as an offset to rent expense. 
  For the   nine   months ended   October 31, 2015   capital expenditures related primarily to the opening of 28 Sephora inside JCPenney stores, investments in information technology in both our home office and stores and investments in our store environment.  We also received construction allowances from landlords of $8 million in the first nine months of 2015. 
  Full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $385 million net of construction allowances from landlords.  Capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 include accrued expenditures of   $46 million   at the end of the   third   quarter. 
  Financing Activities 
  Financing activities for the three months ended   October 29, 2016   resulted in an   inflow   of   $69 million   compared to an   outflow     of   $11 million   for the same period last year.  Financing activities for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   resulted in an   outflow   of   $67 million   compared to an   outflow   of   $49 million   for the same period last year. 
    
  During the first   nine   months of 2016, we completed the refinancing of the 2013 Term Loan Facility with the amended and restated $1.688 billion 2016 Term Loan Facility and the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2023.  Additionally, we repurchased and retired $60 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt and repaid $24 million on our capital leases and note payable.  As of the end of the third quarter of 2016, we had net borrowings of $162 million from our revolving credit facility to fund our seasonal working capital needs. 
    
  Free Cash Flow 
  Free cash flow for the three months ended   October 29, 2016     increased     $9 million   to an   outflow   of   $315 million   compared to an   outflow   of   $324 million   in the same period last year.  Free cash flow for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016     decreased     $23 million   to an   outflow   of   $667 million   compared to an   outflow   of   $644 million   in the same period last year.  The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher incentive compensation payments and capital expenditures that were offset by our positive operating performance and successful inventory management. 
  Cash Flow Outlook 
  For the remainder of 2016, we believe that our existing liquidity will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs; however, in accordance with our long-term financing strategy, we may access the capital markets opportunistically.  We believe that our current financial position will provide us the financial flexibility to support our growth initiatives. 
    
  Credit Ratings 
  During the third quarter of 2016, Moody's Investors Service upgraded our corporate credit rating from B3 to B1 with a stable outlook. 
    
  Our credit ratings and outlook as of   November 25, 2016   from various credit rating agencies were as follows: 
                       
    Corporate

Credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Rating agencies consider, among other things, changes in operating performance, comparable store sales, the economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, financial leverage and changes in our business strategy in their rating decisions. Downgrades to our long-term credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.  
  Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  Aggregate information about our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual or contingent arrangements was disclosed in the   2015   Form 10-K. 
  Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices 
  We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products.  We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations.  Although we cannot  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates used, including those related to inventory valuation under the retail method, valuation of long-lived assets, estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to closed stores, insurance, income taxes, litigation and environmental contingencies and pension accounting. While actual results could differ from these estimates, we do not expect the differences, if any, to have a material effect on the unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  There were no changes to our critical accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016  . For a further discussion of the judgments we make in applying our accounting policies, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
   
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  Recently issued accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Seasonality 
  While a significant portion of our sales, profit and operating cash flows have historically been realized in the fiscal fourth quarter, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors, including seasonal fluctuations in customer demand, product offerings, inventory levels and our promotional activity. The results of operations and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   October 29, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results for future quarters or the entire year. 
   
  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect our current view of future events and financial performance. Words such as "expect" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which include, but are not limited to, statements regarding sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, earnings, cash flows and liquidity. Forward-looking statements are based only on the Company's current assumptions and views of future events and financial performance. They are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of the Company's control, that may cause the Company's actual results to be materially different from planned or expected results. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, including inflation, recession, unemployment levels, consumer confidence and spending patterns, credit availability and debt levels, changes in store traffic trends, the cost of goods, more stringent or costly payment terms and/or the decision by a significant number of vendors not to sell us merchandise on a timely basis or at all, trade restrictions, the ability to monetize non-core assets on acceptable terms, the ability to implement our strategic plan including our omnichannel initiatives, customer acceptance of our strategies, our ability to attract, motivate and retain key executives and other associates, the impact of cost reduction initiatives, our ability to generate or maintain liquidity, implementation of new systems and platforms including EMV chip technology, changes in tariff, freight and shipping rates, changes in the cost of fuel and other energy and transportation costs, disruptions and congestion at ports through which we import goods, increases in wage and benefit costs, competition and retail industry consolidations, interest rate fluctuations, dollar and other currency valuations, the impact of weather conditions, risks associated with war, an act of terrorism or pandemic, the ability of the federal government to fund and conduct its operations, a systems failure and/or security breach that results in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or Company information, legal and regulatory proceedings and the Company s ability to access the debt or equity markets on favorable terms or at all. There can be no assurances that the Company will achieve expected results, and actual results may be materially less than expectations. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is impossible to predict the degree to which any such factors could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results. We intend the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to speak

  We are exposed to market risks in the normal course of business due to changes in interest rates. Our market risks related to interest rates at   October 29, 2016   are similar to those disclosed in the   2015   Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the   third   quarter ended   October 29, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  The matters under the caption "Litigation" in Note 13 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q are incorporated herein by reference. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  The risk factors listed below update and supersede the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016. 
  Our ability to return to profitable growth is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent difficulties associated with implementing our strategic plan. 
  As we position the Company for long-term growth, it may take longer than expected to achieve our objectives, and actual results may be materially less than planned. Our ability to improve our operating results depends upon a significant number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: 
             
    customer response to our marketing and merchandise strategies; 
                
    our ability to achieve profitable sales and to make adjustments in response to changing conditions; 
                
    our ability to respond to competitive pressures in our industry; 
                
    our ability to effectively manage inventory; 
                
    the success of our omnichannel strategy; 
                
    our ability to benefit from capital improvements made to our store environment; 
                
    our ability to respond to any unanticipated changes in expected cash flows, liquidity and cash needs, including our ability to obtain any additional financing or other liquidity enhancing transactions, if and when needed; 
                
    our ability to achieve positive cash flow; 
                
    our ability to access an adequate and uninterrupted supply of merchandise from suppliers at expected levels and on acceptable terms; 
                
    changes to the regulatory environment in which our business operates; and 
                
    general economic conditions. 
     There is no assurance that our marketing, merchandising and omnichannel strategies, or any future adjustments to our strategies, will improve our operating results. 
  We operate in a highly competitive industry, which could adversely impact our sales and profitability. 
  The retail industry is highly competitive, with few barriers to entry. We compete with many other local, regional and national retailers for customers, employees, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business. Those competitors include other department stores, discounters, home furnishing stores, specialty retailers, wholesale clubs, direct-to-consumer businesses, including those on the Internet, and other forms of retail commerce. Some competitors are larger than JCPenney, and/or have greater financial resources available to them, and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting, selling their products, updating their store environment and updating their technology. Competition is characterized by many factors, including merchandise assortment, advertising, price, quality, service, location, reputation, credit availability and customer loyalty. We have experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience for at least the foreseeable future, significant competition from our competitors. The performance of competitors as well as changes in their pricing and promotional policies, marketing activities, customer loyalty programs, new store openings, store renovations, launches of Internet websites or mobile platforms, brand launches and other merchandise and operational strategies could cause  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

us to have lower sales, lower gross margin and/or higher operating expenses such as marketing costs and other selling, general and administrative expenses, which in turn could have an adverse impact on our profitability. 
  Our sales and operating results depend on our ability to develop merchandise offerings that resonate with our existing customers and help to attract new customers. 
  Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to predict and respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences in a timely manner by consistently offering stylish, quality merchandise assortments at competitive prices. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences. There is no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that we will be able to satisfy constantly changing customer demands. To the extent our decisions regarding our merchandise differ from our customers  preferences, we may be faced with reduced sales and excess inventories for some products and/or missed opportunities for others. Any sustained failure to identify and respond to emerging trends in lifestyle and customer preferences and buying trends could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, merchandise misjudgments may adversely impact the perception or reputation of our Company, which could result in declines in customer loyalty and vendor relationship issues, and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  We may also seek to expand into new lines of business from time to time, such as offering large appliances for sale in our stores and online. There is no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Further, if we devote time and resources to new lines of business and those businesses are not as successful as we planned, then we risk damaging our overall business results. We also may not be able to develop new lines of business in a manner that improves our overall business and operating results and may therefore be forced to close the new lines of business, which may damage our reputation and negatively impact our operating results. 
  Our results may be negatively impacted if customers do not maintain their favorable perception of our Company and our private brand merchandise. 
  Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our Company and our private brand merchandise is important to the success of our business. The value of our private brands is based in large part on the degree to which customers perceive and react to them.  The value of our private brands could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including customer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner in sourcing our private brand merchandise, adverse publicity about our private brand merchandise, our failure to maintain the quality of our private brand products, or the failure of our private brand merchandise to deliver consistently good value to the customer.  The growing use of social and digital media by customers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our private brands, or any of our merchandise on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our Company and our private brand merchandise, our business results could be negatively impacted. 
  Our ability to increase sales and store productivity is largely dependent upon our ability to increase customer traffic and conversion. 
  Customer traffic depends upon our ability to successfully market compelling merchandise assortments as well as present an appealing shopping environment and experience to customers. Our strategies focus on increasing customer traffic and improving conversion in our stores and online; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or will result in increased sales. In addition, external events outside of our control, including pandemics, terrorist threats, domestic conflicts and civil unrest, may influence customers' decisions to visit malls or might otherwise cause customers to avoid public places. There is no assurance that we will be able to reverse any decline in traffic or that increases in Internet sales will offset any decline in store traffic. We may need to respond to any declines in customer traffic or conversion rates by increasing markdowns or promotions to attract customers, which could adversely impact our gross margins, operating results and cash flows from operating activities. 
  If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected. 
  Our profitability depends upon our ability to manage appropriate inventory levels and respond quickly to shifts in consumer demand patterns. We must properly execute our inventory management strategies by appropriately allocating merchandise among our stores and online, timely and efficiently distributing inventory to stores, maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in stores and online, adjusting our merchandise mix between our private and exclusive brands and national brands, appropriately changing the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively managing pricing and markdowns. If we overestimate customer demand for our merchandise, we will likely need to  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

record inventory markdowns and sell the excess inventory at clearance prices which would negatively impact our gross margins and operating results. If we underestimate customer demand for our merchandise, we may experience inventory shortages which may result in missed sales opportunities and have a negative impact on customer loyalty. 
  We must protect against security breaches or other unauthorized disclosures of confidential data about our customers as well as about our employees and other third parties. 
  As part of our normal operations, we and third-party service providers with whom we contract receive and maintain information about our customers (including credit/debit card information), our employees and other third parties. Confidential data must at all times be protected against security breaches or other unauthorized disclosure. We have, and require our third-party service providers to have, administrative, physical and technical safeguards and procedures in place to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information and to protect such information against unauthorized access, disclosure or acquisition. Despite our safeguards and security processes and procedures, there is no assurance that all of our systems and processes, or those of our third-party service providers, are free from vulnerability to security breaches or inadvertent data disclosure or acquisition by third parties or us. Further, because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement safeguards. Any failure to protect confidential data about our business or our customers, employees or other third parties could materially damage our brand and reputation as well as result in significant expenses and disruptions to our operations, and loss of customer confidence, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. We could also be subject to government enforcement actions and private litigation as a result of any such failure. 
  The failure to retain, attract and motivate our employees, including employees in key positions, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
  Our results depend on the contributions of our employees, including our senior management team and other key employees. This depends to a great extent on our ability to retain, attract and motivate talented employees throughout the organization, many of whom, particularly in the stores, are in entry level or part-time positions, which have historically had high rates of turnover. We currently operate with significantly fewer individuals than we have in the past who have assumed additional duties and responsibilities, which could have an adverse impact on our operating performance and efficiency. Negative media reports regarding the Company or the retail industry in general could also have an adverse impact on our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees. If we are unable to retain, attract and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is also subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, competing wages, potential union organizing efforts and increased government regulation. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role in our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
  If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable omnichannel experience for our customers, our sales, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected. 
  One of the pillars of our strategic framework is to deliver a superior omnichannel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must anticipate and meet changing customer expectations. Our omnichannel initiatives include our ship-from-store and pickup-in-store programs and expansion of our SKU count online. In addition, we continue to explore ways to enhance our customers  omnichannel shopping experience. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omnichannel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our omnichannel initiatives is not successful or does not meet customer expectations, or we do not realize a return on our omnichannel investments, our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected. 
  Disruptions in our Internet website or mobile applications, or our inability to successfully execute our online strategies, could have an adverse impact on our sales and results of operations. 
  We sell merchandise over the Internet through our website, www.jcpenney.com, and through mobile applications for smart phones and tablets. Our Internet operations are subject to numerous risks, including rapid technological change and the implementation of new systems and platforms; liability for online and mobile content; violations of state or federal laws, including those relating to online and mobile privacy and intellectual property rights; credit card fraud; problems associated with the operation and security of our website, mobile applications and related support systems; computer viruses; telecommunications failures; electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; and the allocation of inventory between our online  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

operations and department stores. The failure of our website or mobile applications to perform as expected could result in disruptions and costs to our operations and make it more difficult for customers to purchase merchandise online. In addition, our inability to successfully develop and maintain the necessary technological interfaces for our customers to purchase merchandise through our website and mobile applications, including user friendly software applications for smart phones and tablets, could result in the loss of Internet sales and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
  Our operations are dependent on information technology systems; disruptions in those systems or increased costs relating to their implementation could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
  Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website and mobile applications, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions, generate performance and financial reports and administer payroll and benefit plans. 
  We have implemented several applications and systems from third party vendors, providers and licensors to simplify our processes and reduce our use of customized existing legacy systems and expect to place additional applications and systems into operation in the future. Implementing new applications and systems carries substantial risk, including implementation delays, cost overruns, disruption of operations, potential loss of data or information, lower customer satisfaction resulting in lost customers or sales, inability to deliver merchandise to our stores or our customers, the potential inability to meet reporting requirements and unintentional security vulnerabilities. There can be no assurances that we will successfully launch the new applications and systems as planned, that the new applications and systems will perform as expected or that the new applications and systems will be implemented without disruptions to our operations, any of which may cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, unreliable, corrupted, insufficient or inaccessible. 
  We also outsource various information technology functions to third party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future. We rely on those third party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis and their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in disruptions and costs to our operations. 
  Our vendors are also highly dependent on the use of information technology systems. Major disruptions in their information technology systems could result in their inability to communicate with us or otherwise to process our transactions or information, their inability to perform required functions, or in the loss or corruption of our information, any and all of which could result in disruptions to our operations. Our vendors are responsible for having safeguards and procedures in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of our information, and to protect our information and systems against unauthorized access, disclosure or acquisition. Any failure in their systems to operate or in their ability to protect our information or systems could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
  We are in the process of insourcing certain business functions from third party vendors and may seek to relocate certain business functions to international locations in an attempt to achieve additional efficiencies, both of which subject us to risks, including disruptions in our business. 
  We are in the process of insourcing certain business functions and may also need to continue to insource other aspects of our business in the future in order to effectively manage our costs and stay competitive. We may also seek from time to time to relocate certain business functions to countries other than the United States to access highly skilled labor markets and further control costs. There is no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Further, these actions may cause disruptions that negatively impact our business. If we are ultimately unable to perform insourced functions better than, or at least as well as, our current third party providers, our operating results could be adversely impacted. 
  Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital markets and adversely affect our liquidity. 
  The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any future downgrades to our long-term credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of us. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all. 
  
   37

Our profitability depends on our ability to source merchandise and deliver it to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
  Our merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of suppliers, and our business depends on being able to find qualified suppliers and access products in a timely and efficient manner. Inflationary pressures on commodity prices and other input costs could increase our cost of goods, and an inability to pass such cost increases on to our customers or a change in our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Additionally, the impact of economic conditions on our suppliers cannot be predicted and our suppliers may be unable to access financing or become insolvent and thus become unable to supply us with products. 
  Our arrangements with our suppliers and vendors may be impacted by our financial results or financial position. 
  Substantially all of our merchandise suppliers and vendors sell to us on open account purchase terms. There is a risk that our key suppliers and vendors could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in or any concern with our financial results or liquidity by requiring or conditioning their sale of merchandise to us on more stringent or more costly payment terms, such as by requiring standby letters of credit, earlier or advance payment of invoices, payment upon delivery or other assurances or credit support or by choosing not to sell merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all. Our arrangements with our suppliers and vendors may also be impacted by media reports regarding our financial position. Our need for additional liquidity could significantly increase and our supply of merchandise could be materially disrupted if a significant portion of our key suppliers and vendors took one or more of the actions described above, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, customer satisfaction, cash flows, liquidity and financial position. 
  Our senior secured real estate term loan credit facility and senior secured notes are secured by certain of our real property and substantially all of our personal property, and such property may be subject to foreclosure or other remedies in the event of our default. In addition, the real estate term loan credit facility and the indenture governing the senior secured notes contain provisions that could restrict our operations and our ability to obtain additional financing. 
  We are (i) party to a $1.688 billion senior secured term loan credit facility and (ii) the issuer of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes that are secured by mortgages on certain real property of the Company, in addition to liens on substantially all personal property of the Company, subject to certain exclusions set forth in the security documents relating to the term loan credit facility and the senior secured notes. The real property subject to mortgages under the term loan credit facility and the indenture governing the senior secured notes includes our distribution centers and certain of our stores. 
  The credit and guaranty agreement governing the term loan credit facility and the indenture governing the senior secured notes contain operating restrictions which may impact our future alternatives by limiting, without lender consent, our ability to borrow additional funds, execute certain equity financings or enter into dispositions or other liquidity enhancing or strategic transactions regarding certain of our assets, including our real property. Our ability to obtain additional or other financing or to dispose of certain assets could also be negatively impacted because a substantial portion of our owned assets have been pledged as collateral for repayment of our indebtedness under the term loan credit facility and the senior secured notes. 
  If an event of default occurs and is continuing, our outstanding obligations under the term loan credit facility and the senior secured notes could be declared immediately due and payable or the lenders could foreclose on or exercise other remedies with respect to the assets securing the term loan credit facility and the senior secured notes, including our distribution centers and certain of our stores. If an event of default occurs, there is no assurance that we would have the cash resources available to repay such accelerated obligations or refinance such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 
  Our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility limits our borrowing capacity to the value of certain of our assets. In addition, our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility is secured by certain of our personal property, and lenders may exercise remedies against the collateral in the event of our default. 
  We are party to a $2.35 billion senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. Our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility varies according to the Company s inventory levels, accounts receivable and credit card receivables, net of certain reserves. In the event of any material decrease in the amount of or appraised value of these assets, our borrowing capacity would similarly decrease, which could adversely impact our business and liquidity. 
  Our revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain restrictions on operations become applicable if our availability falls below certain thresholds. These covenants could impose significant operating and  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

financial limitations and restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to enter into particular transactions and to engage in other actions that we may believe are advisable or necessary for our business. 
  Our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by liens with respect to inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts and certain related collateral. In the event of a default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods, the lenders  commitment to extend further credit under our revolving credit facility could be terminated, our outstanding obligations could become immediately due and payable, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral, which generally consists of the Company s inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts and cash credited thereto. If we are unable to borrow under our revolving credit facility, we may not have the necessary cash resources for our operations and, if any event of default occurs, there is no assurance that we would have the cash resources available to repay such accelerated obligations, refinance such indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or cash collateralize our letters of credit, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 
  Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may require the use of our available cash resources to meet repayment obligations, which could reduce the cash available for other purposes. 
  As of October 29, 2016, we have   $4.796 billion   in total indebtedness and we are highly leveraged. Our level of indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, to fund additional projects, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, and other general corporate or other obligations, as well as increase the risks to our business associated with general adverse economic and industry conditions. Our level of indebtedness may also place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged. 
  We are required to make quarterly repayments in a principal amount equal to $10.55 million during the seven-year term of the real estate term loan credit facility, subject to certain reductions for mandatory and optional prepayments. In addition, we are required to make prepayments of the real estate term loan credit facility with the proceeds of certain asset sales, insurance proceeds and excess cash flow, which will reduce the cash available for other purposes, including capital expenditures for store improvements, and could impact our ability to reinvest in other areas of our business. 
  There is no assurance that our internal and external sources of liquidity will at all times be sufficient for our cash requirements. 
  We must have sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements, capital improvement plans, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our credit facilities, other debt financings, equity financings and sales of non-operating assets. We expect our ability to generate cash through the sale of non-operating assets to diminish as our portfolio of non-operating assets decreases. In addition, our recent operating losses have limited our capital resources. Our ability to achieve our business and cash flow plans is based on a number of assumptions which involve significant judgments and estimates of future performance, borrowing capacity and credit availability, which cannot at all times be assured. Accordingly, there is no assurance that cash flows from operations and other internal and external sources of liquidity will at all times be sufficient for our cash requirements. If necessary, we may need to consider actions and steps to improve our cash position and mitigate any potential liquidity shortfall, such as modifying our business plan, pursuing additional financing to the extent available, reducing capital expenditures, pursuing and evaluating other alternatives and opportunities to obtain additional sources of liquidity and other potential actions to reduce costs. There can be no assurance that any of these actions would be successful, sufficient or available on favorable terms. Any inability to generate or obtain sufficient levels of liquidity to meet our cash requirements at the level and times needed could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position. 
  Our ability to obtain any additional financing or any refinancing of our debt, if needed at any time, depends upon many factors, including our existing level of indebtedness and restrictions in our debt facilities, historical business performance, financial projections, prospects and creditworthiness and external economic conditions and general liquidity in the credit and capital markets. Any additional debt, equity or equity-linked financing may require modification of our existing debt agreements, which there is no assurance would be obtainable. Any additional financing or refinancing could also be extended only at higher costs and require us to satisfy more restrictive covenants, which could further limit or restrict our business and results of operations, or be dilutive to our stockholders.

Our use of interest rate hedging transactions could expose us to risks and financial losses that may adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 
  To reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we have entered into, and in the future may enter into, interest rate swaps with various financial counterparties. The interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our variable rate interest payments to a fixed price. There can be no assurances, however, that our hedging activity will be effective in insulating us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. In addition, our hedging transactions may expose us to certain risks and financial losses, including, among other things: 
             
    counterparty credit risk; 
                
    the risk that the duration or amount of the hedge may not match the duration or amount of the related liability; 
                
    the hedging transactions may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair values, downward adjustments or  mark-to-market losses,  which would affect our stockholders  equity; and 
                
    the risk that we may not be able to meet the terms and conditions of the hedging instruments, in which case we may be required to settle the instruments prior to maturity with cash payments that could significantly affect our liquidity. 
     Further, we have designated the swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  . However, in the future, we may fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under these standards for a number of reasons, including if we fail to satisfy hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements or if the swaps are not highly effective. If we fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, losses on the swaps caused by the change in their fair value will be recognized as part of net income, rather than being recognized as part of other comprehensive income. 
  Operating results and cash flows may cause us to incur asset impairment charges. 
  Long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment, are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment, or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that a full recovery of net asset values through future cash flows is in question.  We also assess the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Our impairment review requires us to make estimates and projections regarding, but not limited to, sales, operating profit and future cash flows.  If our operating performance reflects a sustained decline, we may be exposed to significant asset impairment charges in future periods, which could be material to our results of operations. 
  Reductions in income and cash flow from our marketing and servicing arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. 
  Synchrony Financial ( Synchrony ) owns and services our private label credit card and co-branded MasterCard  programs. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to the Company, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the percentage of sales on private label and co-branded accounts relative to the Company s total sales, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony s ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking and consumer protection laws, which could also materially limit the availability of credit to consumers or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that the Company receives from Synchrony can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from our consumer credit card program agreement with Synchrony decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
  We are subject to customer payment-related risks that could increase operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business. 
  We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards (including private label credit cards) and gift cards. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted,  
  
   40

making compliance more difficult or costly. The payment card industry set October 1, 2015 as the date on which liability shifted for certain debit and credit card transactions to retailers who are not able to accept EMV chip technology transactions. As a result, we bear the chargeback risk for fraudulent transactions generated through EMV chip enabled cards prior to implementation of the EMV chip technology. Further, we may experience a decrease in transaction volume if we cannot process transactions for cardholders whose issuer has migrated entirely from magnetic strip to EMV chip enabled cards. Any prolonged inability to accept EMV chip technology transactions may subject us to increased risk of liability for fraudulent transactions and may adversely affect our business and operating results. 
  We are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries. 
  A substantial portion of our merchandise is sourced by our vendors and by us outside of the United States. All of our vendors must comply with our supplier legal compliance program and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws. Although we diversify our sourcing and production by country and supplier, the failure of a supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, or our inability to flow merchandise to our stores or through the Internet channel in the right quantities at the right time, could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation. 
  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies, which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our results of operations. 
  We are subject to the various risks of importing merchandise from abroad and purchasing product made in foreign countries, such as:

Disruptions and congestion at ports through which we import merchandise may increase our costs and/or delay the receipt of goods in our stores, which could adversely impact our profitability, financial position and cash flows. 
  We ship the majority of our private brand merchandise by ocean to ports in the United States. Our national brand suppliers also ship merchandise by ocean. Disruptions in the operations of ports through which we import our merchandise, including but not limited to labor disputes involving work slowdowns, lockouts or strikes, could require us and/or our vendors to ship merchandise by air freight or to alternative ports in the United States. Shipping by air is significantly more expensive than shipping by ocean which could adversely affect our profitability. Similarly, shipping to alternative ports in the United States could result in increased lead times and transportation costs. Disruptions at ports through which we import our goods could also result in unanticipated inventory shortages, which could adversely impact our reputation and our results of operations. 
  Our Company s growth and profitability depend on the levels of consumer confidence and spending. 
  Our results of operations are sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Many economic factors outside of our control, including the housing market, interest rates, recession, inflation and deflation, energy costs and availability, consumer credit availability and terms, consumer debt levels, tax rates and policy, and unemployment trends influence consumer confidence and spending. The domestic and international political situation and actions also affect consumer confidence and spending. Additional events that could impact our performance include pandemics, terrorist threats and activities, worldwide military and domestic disturbances and conflicts, political instability and civil unrest. Declines in the level of consumer spending could adversely affect our growth and profitability. 
  Our business is seasonal, which impacts our results of operations. 
  Our annual earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent on the results of operations for the last quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions. This seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. 
  Our profitability may be impacted by weather conditions. 
  Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unseasonable or unexpected weather conditions such as warm temperatures during the winter season or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. Extreme weather or natural disasters could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise, preclude customers from traveling to our stores, delay capital improvements or cause us to close stores. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations. 
  Changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations could increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. 
  Our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. Government intervention and activism and/or regulatory reform may result in substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations and/or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, which may lead to additional compliance costs as well as the diversion of our management s time and attention from strategic initiatives. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation that could disrupt our operations and increase our costs of doing business. Changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as privacy and information security, product safety, environmental protection, including regulations in response to concerns regarding climate change, collective bargaining activities, minimum wage, wage and hour, and health care mandates, among others, as well as changes to applicable accounting rules and regulations, such as changes to lease accounting standards, could also cause our compliance costs to increase and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Legal and regulatory proceedings could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
  Our Company is subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business, certain of which may involve jurisdictions with reputations for aggressive application of laws and procedures against corporate defendants. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including class action litigation brought under various consumer protection, employment, and privacy and information security laws. In addition, litigation risks related to claims that technologies we use infringe intellectual  
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

property rights of third parties have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose primary business is to assert such claims. Reserves are established based on our best estimates of our potential liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation. Regardless of the outcome or whether the claims are meritorious, legal and regulatory proceedings may require that we devote substantial time and expense to defend our Company. Unfavorable rulings could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
  Significant changes in discount rates, actual investment return on pension assets, and other factors could affect our earnings, equity, and pension contributions in future periods. 
  Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense recorded for our qualified pension plan. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) require that income or expense for the plan be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial assumptions and calculations. The most significant assumptions relate to the capital markets, interest rates and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. Two critical assumptions used to estimate pension income or expense for the year are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. In addition, at the measurement date, we must also reflect the funded status of the plan (assets and liabilities) on the balance sheet, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. We may also experience volatility in the amount of the annual actuarial gains or losses recognized as income or expense because we have elected to recognize pension expense using mark-to-market accounting. Although GAAP expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we could be required to contribute to the pension plan. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve a plan s funded status. 
  Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. 
  The market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Future announcements or disclosures concerning us or any of our competitors, our strategic initiatives, our sales and profitability, our financial condition, any quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results or comparable sales, any failure to meet analysts  expectations and sales of large blocks of our common stock, among other factors, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. This volatility could affect the price at which you could sell shares of our common stock. 
  Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities. The Company and certain of our current and former members of the Board of Directors and executives are defendants in a consolidated class action lawsuit and two related stockholder derivative actions that were filed following our announcement of an issuance of common stock on September 26, 2013. Such litigation could result in substantial costs, divert our management s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  The Company s ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited. 
  The Company has a federal net operating loss (NOL) of $2.6 billion as of January 30, 2016. These NOL carryforwards (expiring in 2032 through 2034) are available to offset future taxable income. The Company may recognize additional NOLs in the future. 
  Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by a corporation's NOLs if the corporation experiences an  ownership change  as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when the Company s  five-percent shareholders  (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) collectively increase their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over a rolling three-year period. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state NOLs following an ownership change. 
  If an ownership change occurs, the amount of the taxable income for any post-change year that may be offset by a pre-change loss is subject to an annual limitation that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year. This limitation is derived by multiplying the fair market value of the Company stock as of the ownership change by the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt rate, which was 2.65% at January 30, 2016. To the extent that a company has a net unrealized built-in gain at the time  
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

of an ownership change, which is realized or deemed recognized during the five-year period following the ownership change, there is an increase in the annual limitation for each of the first five-years that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year. 
  The Company has an ongoing study of the rolling three-year testing periods. Based upon the elections the Company has made and the information that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission through October 29, 2016, the Company has not had a Section 382 ownership change through October 29, 2016. 
  If an ownership change should occur in the future, the Company s ability to use the NOL to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income generated by the Company in future periods. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to fully utilize the NOL and the Company could be required to record an additional valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL that may not be realized, which could impact the Company s result of operations. 
  We believe that these NOL carryforwards are a valuable asset for us.  Consequently, we have a stockholder rights plan in place, which was approved by the Company s stockholders, to protect our NOLs during the effective period of the rights plan.  Although the rights plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an  ownership change  that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the restrictions on transferability in the rights plan will prevent all transfers that could result in such an  ownership change.  
  The rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, our Company or a large block of our common stock.  A third party that acquires 4.9% or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the rights plan through the issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents to all stockholders other than the acquiring person. 
  The foregoing provisions may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging potential investors from acquiring our stock.  In addition, these provisions could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, or impede an attempt to acquire a significant or controlling interest in us, even if such events might be beneficial to us and our stockholders.

  SEVENTH AMENDMENT TO 
  AMENDED AND RESTATED CONSUMER CREDIT CARD PROGRAM 
  AGREEMENT 
    This Seventh Amendment ( Amendment Number 7 ) dated as of August 17, 2016 to that certain Consumer Credit Card Program Agreement made as of December 6, 1999, as amended and restated as of November 5, 2009, and as amended as of October 29, 2010, January 30, 2013, October 11, 2013, February 25, 2014, April 6, 2015 and June 26, 2015 by and between J. C. PENNEY CORPORATION, INC., formerly known as J. C. Penney Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at Plano, Texas, and SYNCHRONY BANK, assignee of Monogram Credit Card Bank of Georgia and formerly known as GE Capital Retail Bank and GE Money Bank, with its principal place of business at 170 W. Election Road, Draper, Utah 84020 (the  Agreement ).  Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. 
  WITNESSETH: 
    WHEREAS, JCPenney and Bank desire to make certain changes to the Agreement to reflect certain modifications to the Program that the parties desire to implement. 
    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the terms and conditions stated herein, and for good and valuable consideration the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
  ARTICLE I - AMENDMENTS 
           A. 
    Amendment to Section 2.7.    Section 2.7 of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
     2.7        Promotional Financing Programs  . JCPenney may offer Deferred Interest Promotions and No Interest Promotions (each as defined below), or such other promotions as are mutually agreed to by the parties, to consumers as a part of marketing the Program ( Credit Promotions ).  The frequency and volume of such Credit Promotions for Purchases shall be determined by JCPenney, provided that the total Purchase meets or exceeds the thresholds as may be established by Bank and JCPenney by mutual agreement from time to time.  The Credit Promotions will be subject to fees payable by Retailer to Bank.  Bank shall determine such fees based on type (e.g. Deferred Interest Promotion, No Interest Promotion), length and minimum transaction value of the Credit Promotions.  Bank shall provide adequate advance  

notice in writing for any change in fees, including the start date for such revised fees.  Based on the Credit Promotions that Bank has priced, JCPenney, in its sole discretion, will determine what Credit Promotions it will run.  Bank shall not remove any consumer s promotional rate during the stated promotional period without the prior written consent of JCPenney.   Deferred Interest Promotion  means a credit promotion pursuant to which a Cardholder must make at least minimum payments during the promotional period and if they pay the promotional balance in full during the promotional period, no interest charges are imposed with respect to such promotional purchases (but if the promotional purchase balance is not paid in full during the promotional period, interest charges are assessed from the purchase date).   No Interest Promotion  means a credit promotion pursuant to which a Cardholder does not pay interest charges on new purchases for a specified period of time but must make minimum monthly payments.  In addition to the forgoing, the parties shall have the rights and obligations set forth in Schedule 2.7. 
  B.        Amendment to Schedule 3.3(e).    Schedule 3.3(e) of the Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced with the new Schedule 3.3(e) attached hereto. 
  C.        Deletion of Exhibits U and U.1 .   Exhibits U and U.1 to the Agreement are hereby deleted in their entirety together with all references thereto in the Agreement.  In connection therewith, the definition of  Program Earned Income  in Schedule 4.10 of the Agreement is hereby amended by deleting in subsections (a)(iii) and (b)(ii):  in accordance with Exhibit U during such period  
  D. Deletion of Certain Defined Terms in Section 15.1.    The following defined terms are hereby deleted from the Agreement, together with all references thereto:

  CERTIFICATION  
  I, Marvin R. Ellison, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of J. C. Penney Company, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
