NOTE
1   NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

History
of the Company   

XFit
Brands, Inc. ( XFit  or the  Company ) was incorporated on September 16, 2014 under the laws of the State
of Nevada. The fiscal year of the Company is June 30. XFit s principal business activity is the design, development, and
worldwide marketing and selling of functional equipment, training gear, apparel and accessories for the sports market and fitness
industry. The Company provides a full portfolio of products and services spanning Mixed Martial Arts and other high and low impact
fitness regimes and own the trademarks Throwdown , EnviroTurf , GlideBoxx  and Transformations. Products are sold
to gyms, fitness facilities, universities, first responders and directly to consumers via website and through third party catalogues
through a mix of independent distributors and licensees.  

These
financial statements represent the consolidated financial statements of XFit and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries Throwdown
Industries Holdings, LLC ( Holdings ), Throwdown Industries, LLC ( TDLLC ), and Throwdown Industries,
Inc. ( TDINC ).  

Forward
Stock Split   

On
March 28, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a 1-for-5 forward split of its outstanding shares of common stock (and proportional
increase of its authorized common stock from 250 million shares to 1.25 billion shares) with a record date of April 14, 2016 and
an effective date of April 15, 2016. Prior to the split, the Company had 4,118,500 shares issued and outstanding and after the
split, the Company had 20,592,500 shares issued and outstanding. All references to the number of shares and per-share amounts
within these condensed consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, have been retroactively restated to reflect
this stock split, unless explicitly stated otherwise.  

Basis
of presentation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments
necessary to fairly state the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the dates
and periods presented. The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information.  

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial
statements and footnotes as of and for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, which were filed with the Company s annual
report Form 10-K on September 29, 2016. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending June 30, 2017 or for any other interim period.  

Basis
of Consolidation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of XFit, Holdings and TDINC. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements do not include the financials or any impact from
it recent acquisition of EnviroTurf  and GlideBoxx  which were acquired after September 30, 2016 (see Note 11, Subsequent
Events).  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has implemented all applicable new accounting standards and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements
that have been issued that may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of
Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU-2015-03 ) .  ASU 2015-03 requires companies
to present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that debt liability. ASU 2015-03 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is allowed
for financial statements that have not been previously issued. Entities would apply the new guidance retrospectively to all prior
periods (i.e., the balance sheet for each period is adjusted). The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on
the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

Loss
per Share   

The
basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares during the period. The diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company s net loss
available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. To compute the
diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding, the company begins with the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding
and adds any potentially dilutive securities that are convertible into shares of common stock. Diluted net loss per share is the
same as basic net loss per share due to the lack of dilutive items. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company had warrants outstanding to acquire shares of common stock that totaled 2,174,281 and 2,055,838 shares, respectively,
which were excluded as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  

Reclassifications   

Certain
reclassifications were made to the prior period condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.
There was no change to the previously reported net loss.  

Use
of Estimates   

Condensed
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Among other things, management has estimated the collectability of its accounts
receivable, the valuation of long-lived assets, and the fair value of equity instruments issued. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  

Loan
Discounts and Loan Fees   

The
Company amortizes loan discounts over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. Costs associated with obtaining
financing are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related loans using the effective interest method. Amortization of
the debt issuance costs was $60,377 and $41,108 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was
recorded as a component of interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

NOTE
2   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET   

Property
and equipment consisted of the following at:  

Depreciation
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $5,469 and $4,599, respectively.  

NOTE
3   INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET   

Intangible
assets consisted of the following at:  

Amortization
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $8,100 and $10,783, respectively.  

NOTE
4   SHORT TERM FINANCING   

On
May 3, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) with a single accredited investor ( Investor )
under which it issued and sold to Investor a promissory note in the principal amount of $125,000 (the  Note ). The
Note has a maturity date of December 31, 2016 and an original issue discount of $20,000. In addition, the Company agreed to pay
Investor s expenses in connection with the SPA and issuance of the Note of $5,000. Accordingly, the Company received net
proceeds from Investor of $100,000, which proceeds were used for investor relation services. This financing is listed on the condensed
consolidated balance sheets under accrued expenses.  

So
long as the Note is outstanding, upon any issuance of any security with any term more favorable to the holder of such security
or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that was not similarly provided to Investor in the Note or the SPA, then
the Company will notify Investor of such additional or more favorable term and such term, at Investor s option, shall become
a part of the Note and/or SPA. The types of terms contained in another security that may be more favorable to the holder of such
security include, but are not limited to, terms interest rates, and original issue discounts.  

Interest
shall not accrue on the unpaid principal balance of this Note unless an Event of Default occurs. Upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default, the outstanding balance of this Note shall bear interest at the lesser of the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum
or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. The Note has a prepayment deadline of November 3, 2016. Events of Default under
the Note include failure to pay any amounts when due, including on the prepayment deadline, breach of covenants or representations
and warranties or upon voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.  

At
any time following the occurrence of an Event of Default, Investor may, by written notice to the Company, declare all unpaid principal,
plus all accrued interest and other amounts due hereunder to be immediately due and payable at an amount equal to 125% of the
outstanding principal amount of the Note at the time of the default ( Mandatory Default Amount ); provided, however,
that for an Event of Default for failure to pay the Note in full on the Prepayment Deadline, Investor will not accelerate the
Note unless the Company fails to pay the Mandatory Default Amount (plus all accrued interest from and after the Event of Default)
on the Maturity Date.  

NOTE
5   NOTES PAYABLE   

The
note payable is comprised of the following at:  

On
June 10, 2014, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement ( Agreement ) with Pacific Investment Management
Company ( PIMCO ) that authorized the issuance of up to $2,500,000. On June 12, 2014, the Company entered into a Senior
Secured Note ( Note ) whereby the Company drew $1,500,000. The note bears interest at 14% and an effective interest
rate of 21%. This Note is collateralized by all of the assets of the Company except  its Accounts Receivable which it is
in second position to Crown Financial.  

On
February 6, 2015, the Company drew down an additional $500,000 of funds on the PIMCO Agreement. Following the February 6, 2015
draw, the principal balance payable on the PIMCO note is $2,000,000, and on October 20, 2015 the Company drew down the final $500,000
in funds on this loan facility. The full principal balance outstanding related to this note is due on July 12, 2017. During November
2016 the Company finalized terms of refinancing its note payable with PIMCO. Both the note holder and the Company are in process
of executing the final note agreements. The parties reached an agreement to treat the interest as Payment in Kind (PIK) and add
the interest to the amount of the loan on a monthly basis. This, in effect, increased the amount of the loan. Currently the Company
is finalizing an agreement with the lender to extend the note for an additional 3 years.  

The
Note includes various covenants, including but not limited to, having annual audited financial statements within 90 days of the
end of the fiscal year. At September 30, 2016, the Company is in compliance with all covenants.  

In
connection with the Note, the Company granted warrants to acquire up to 10% of the Company s capital stock based on an aggregate
enterprise fair market value of $15.0 million. The Company valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following variables: annual dividend yield of 0%; expected life of 10 years; risk free rate of return of 2.92%; and expected
volatility of 0%. The Company estimated the value of the warrants to be $377,480, which is recorded as a loan discount and is
being amortized under the effective interest method to interest expense over the term of the loan.  

NOTE
6   BANK LINE OF CREDIT   

On
July 24, 2015, the Company entered into an unsecured line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank. The line of credit bears interest at
prime plus 4% and is personally guaranteed by the Company s chief executive officer. There is no maturity date and the Company
was in compliance as of September 30, 2016.

8   STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT   

Equity
Purchase Agreement   

On
December 17, 2014, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement with Kodiak Capital LLC (Kodiak). The Equity Purchase
Agreement provides the Company with financing whereby the Company can issue and sell to Kodiak, from time to time, shares of common
stock (the   Put Shares  ) up to an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 million (the   Maximum Commitment
Amount  ) during the commitment period. The commitment period is defined as the period beginning on the trading day immediately
following the effectiveness of the registration statement and ending December 31, 2016. In addition, in no event shall Kodiak
be entitled to purchase that number of Put Shares which when added to the sum of the number of shares of common stock already
beneficially owned by Kodiak would exceed 9.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the applicable closing
date.  

The
Equity Purchase Agreement will terminate when any of the following events occur: (i) Kodiak has purchased an aggregate of $5.0
million of the Company s common stock, (ii) on December 31, 2016 or (iii) upon written notice from the Company to Kodiak.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, The Company  put 2,650 shares to Kodiak and received $213,560. As of September
30, 2016, the Company has put 3,100,000 shares to Kodiak under the equity purchase agreement. There are no more registered shares
remaining that could be put to Kodiak in the future.  

Investment
Agreement with GHS Investments, LLC   

On
August 13, 2016 the Company entered into an Investment Agreement (the  Investment Agreement ) with GHS Investments,
LLC ( GHS ). The Investment Agreement gives the Company the option to sell to GHS, up to $5,000,000 worth of its common
stock ( Shares ), over the period following effectiveness of a registration statement covering the resale of the Shares
(the  Effective Date ) and ending thirty-six (36) months after the Effective Date. Under the terms of the Investment
Agreement, the Company has the right to deliver from time to time a Put Notice to GHS stating the dollar amount of Put Shares
(up to $500,000 under any individual Put Notice)(the  Put Amount ) that it intends to sell to GHS with the price per
share based on the following formula: the lesser of (a) the lowest sale price for the Common Stock on the date of the Put Notice
(the  Put Notice Date ); or (b) the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest trading prices for the Company s
Common Stock during the five trading days following the Put Notice Date. The maximum number of shares that can be put to GHS is
two times the average daily trading volume during the ten trading days prior to the closing of a put (the  Closing Date ).
If the amount of the tranche of its outstanding shares exceeds the volume limitation, additional tranches will be delivered until
the entire Purchase Amount is delivered. Each tranche, including the initial tranche, will trigger a new purchase price, and will
be priced according to the purchase price definition. There are a number of conditions to the Company effecting a put, including
the effectiveness of the registration statement.  

As
of September 30, 2016 the registration statement for the above Investment Agreement still needs to be amended to include the consolidated
financials of the recent EnviroTurf acquisition (see Note 11, Subsequent Events). Therefore the Company has not placed any shares
under this GHS agreement.  

Vendor
Credit Agreements   

On
June 26 2015, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Yayu General Machinery Co., LTD, whereby the Company issued

to use for future inventory purchases (the  Vendor Credit ). The Company can use all or part of the Vendor Credit
until the Vendor Credit is exhausted. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company had $82,112 and $105,096, respectfully,

Overview   

XFit
Brands, Inc. was incorporated in September 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. As used herein, the terms  we, 
 us,   XFIT,  and the  Company  refer to XFit Brands, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries,
and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our fiscal year end is June 30. Our principal office address
is 25731 Commercentre Drive, Lake Forest, CA 92630. Our telephone number is (949) 916-9680. As of November 16, 2016, we had 10
employees.  

Our
principal business activity is the design, development, and worldwide marketing and selling of functional equipment, training
gear, apparel, and accessories for the impact sports market and fitness industry. Our products are marketed and sold under our
Throwdown , XFit Brands , and Transformations  brand names to gyms, fitness facilities, and directly to consumers
via our internet website and through third party catalogues (which we refer to as our  Direct to Consumer  operations)
through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world. All of our products are manufactured by independent
contractors. Our equipment and apparel products are produced both in the United States and abroad.  

We
are an  emerging growth company  within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging
growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are
not  emerging growth companies,  including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in
our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive
compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of
these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.  

Results
of Operations   

For
the next twelve months, our current operating plan is focused on the development and sale of sports surfaces, training and protective
gear for the Mixed Martial Arts ( MMA ), fitness, training, and exercise industry.  

Our
long term growth strategy includes expanding our presence in the fitness, training, and exercise community; leveraging our MMA
core credibility and heritage; developing strategic alliances; and acquiring other companies in the fitness, training, and exercise
industry to leverage our asset base, manufacturing infrastructure, market presence, and experienced personnel.  

As
is discussed further in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we have limited funds to support our operations. Our
continuation as a going concern subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2016 is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing
to fund the continued operation of our business model for a long enough period to achieve profitable operations. Based on our
current business plan, we currently estimate we will need up to an additional $612,000 of financing to execute our business plan
over the next twelve months. There can be no assurance, however, that such financing will be available or, if it is available,
that we will be able to structure such financing on terms acceptable to us and that it will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements
until we can reach a level of profitable operations and positive cash flows. If we are unable to obtain the financing necessary
to support our operations, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Our
revenue, operating expenses, and net loss from operations for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
three month period ended September 30, 2015, are set forth below.  

Revenues .
 Revenues consist of product sales. Total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $492,007, an increase
of $18,750, or 4.0%, from $473,257 of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in product sales
is attributable to increased selling efforts and momentum during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Cost
of Revenues.   Total cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $277,108, an increase of $18,260,
or 7.1%, from $258,845  for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of product sales during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 were 56.3% as compared to 54.7% during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cost of revenues
is attributable to both promotional activity with a key account in conjunction with the 4.0% increase in product sales during
the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Gross
Profit.   Gross profit increased $491 to $214,899 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from a gross profit of
$214,412 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross profit reflects the increase in product cost of
sales in connection with promotional activity, During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we realized a 43.7% gross profit
on our product sales as compared to a 45.3% gross profit on product sales during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
lower gross profit achieved during the three months ended September 30, 2015 is promotional activity with the fitness accessories.  

General
and Administrative Expenses.   General and administrative expenses decreased by $46,684 or 10.5%, to $398,245 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from $444,930 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. General   administrative expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are comprised of salaries and wages of $118,567, professional fees of $121,358,
office expenses of $1,193, insurance of $22,881, rent of $67,870, travel of $12,987, and other of $53,389. General   administrative
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 are comprised of salaries and wages of $178,578, professional fees of $181,851,
office expenses of $1,137, insurance of $19,675, rent of $15,182, travel of $10,413, and $38,093 of other general and administrative
expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is comprised of
an decrease in salaries and wages of $60,011, a decrease in professional fees of $60,492, an increase in office expenses of $55,
an increase of $3,206 in insurance expense, an increase of $52,688 of rent expense, an increase of $2,573 of travel expenses,
and a net $15,296 increase in other general and administrative expenses. Despite the $52,688 increase in rent, the overall decrease
in general and administrative expenses is attributable to decreased salaries, wages and professional fees as we continue to scale
the Company for growth.  

Sales
and Marketing Expense.   Sales and marketing expense decreased $25,720 or 28.6%, to $64,175 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 from $89,894 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in sales and marketing expense is attributable
to a decrease is wages.  

Interest
Expense.   Interest expense increased by $42,655 to $158,932 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $116,277
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is largely due to the increased interest expense on the delayed draw
note with the PIMCO Fund during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The principal balance of the PIMCO note was $2,742,720
during the three months ended September 30, 2015, while the principal balance during the three months ended September 30, 2015,
was $2,111,301. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we also incurred $649 interest on the line of credit with Wells
Fargo Bank while the interest during the three months ended  September 30, 2015 was $658.  

Other
Income.   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, and the three months ended September 30, 2015, we did not earn
other income.  

Net
Loss.   Net loss decreased by $30,239 or 6.9% to a net loss of $406,453 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from
a net loss of $436,689  for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in our net loss is attributable to the
decreases in salaries, wages and professional fees.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Our
consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the consolidated financial statements,
we incurred a net loss of $406,453 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and losses are expected to continue in the
near term. The accumulated deficit since inception is $8,224,275 at September 30, 2016. We have been funding our operations through
private loans and the sale of equity interests in private placement transactions. See our discussion of our Credit Facility with
PIMCO and our Equity Purchase Agreement with Kodiak Capital below. Our cash resources are insufficient to meet our planned business
objectives without additional financing. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that may result from the possible inability of our company to continue as a going concern.  

Management
anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to further develop our product lines and licensing relationships
to expand product sales and royalty revenues before significant positive operating cash flows can be achieved. Our ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues
and profitable operations. At September 30, 2016, we had $61,096 of cash on hand. We anticipate that our existing cash and cash
equivalents, together with our cash from operating activities will not be sufficient to fund operations and expected growth through
at least the next twelve months. These funds are insufficient to complete our business plan and as a consequence, we will need
to seek additional funds, primarily through the issuance of debt or equity securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance
can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us.
Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing
or cause substantial dilution for our stock holders, in case of equity financing.  

Management
has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months
and beyond. These steps include (a) raising additional capital and/or obtaining financing; (b) executing contracts with international
licensees; and (c) controlling overhead and expenses. There can be no assurance that we can successfully accomplish these steps
and it is uncertain that we will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance
that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all.  

In
the event we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may elect or be required to seek protection from our creditors by filing
a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, management has not considered
this alternative, nor does management view it as a likely occurrence.  

The
success of our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining new customers for our products and new licensees
to generate royalty revenues, and maintaining a break even or profitable level of operations. We have incurred operating losses
since inception, and this is likely to continue in the near future. We believe that we are able to fund our immediate operations,
working capital requirements, and debt service requirements with existing working capital, cash flows generated from operations,
and additional borrowings under our delayed draw note or, if available, under our equity purchase agreement with GHS.  

Our
financial requirements will be dependent upon the financial support through credit facilities and additional sales of our equity
securities. There can be no assurance, however, that such financing will be available or, if it is available, that we will be
able to structure such financing on terms acceptable to us and that it will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements until
we can reach a level of profitable operations and positive cash flows. If we are unable to obtain the financing necessary to support
our operations, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. We currently have a verbal commitment but no formal written commitments
for any additional capital.  

The
downturn in the United States stock and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of
equity or debt securities. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs
and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to
seek alternative financing. Further, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, stockholders may experience additional
dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our shares
of common stock or the debt securities may cause us to be subject to restrictive covenants. If additional financing is not available
or is not available on acceptable terms, we may have to curtail our operations.  

Cash,
total current assets, total assets, total current liabilities and total liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016
are as follows:  

At
September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $788,237 compared to a working capital deficit of $674,956 at June
30, 2016 Current liabilities increased to $1,405,549 at September 30, 2016 from $1,263,665 at June 30, 2016, primarily as a result
of increases in accounts payable and the bank line of credit.  

Our
operating activities used net cash of $158,537 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash used in operations
of $48,598 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The net cash used in operations for the three months ended September
30, 2016, reflects a net loss of $406,453, decreased by $72,470 in non-cash charges and by $175,446 net increase in the working
capital accounts. The net cash used in operations for the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflects a net loss of $436,689,
decreased by $131,490 in non-cash charges and by $256,601net increase in the working capital accounts.  

We
did not have any cash related to investing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.  

Our
net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $212,804, which consisted of decrease
of $1,021 Wells Fargo line of credit and $213,825 in proceeds in the sale of stock to Kodiak Capital.  

Credit
Facility   

On
June 10, 2014, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement ( Agreement ) with PIMCO Funds: Private Account Portfolio
Series: PIMCO High Yield Portfolio, a separate investment portfolio of PIMCO Funds, a Massachusetts business trust ( PIMCO )
that authorized the issuance of up to $2,500,000. On June 12, 2014, we entered into a Senior Secured Note ( Note )
whereby we drew $1,500,000. The note bears interest at 14% and matures on June 12, 2017. Interest in payable monthly in arrears,
provided that if no event of default has occurred, Obligor can elect to pay cash interest on each payment date at 9%, with the
additional unpaid interest due on such dates added to the principal balance, The note bears an effective interest rate of 21%.
This Note is collateralized by all of our assets. The Note includes various covenants, including but not limited to, having annual
audited financial statements within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year.  

On
February 6, 2015, we drew an additional $500,000 under this facility to increase the principal amount payable (including the accrued
interest added to the principal amount) under this note to $2,044,300 and on October 20, 2015, we drew the remaining $500,000
available under this facility to increase the amount payable under this note (with accrued interest) to $2,620,098. We issued
10,000 shares of our common stock to PIMCO as a loan fee in consideration of the October 2015 draw down. A replacement note was
issued on each draw down date to reflect the note increase.  

Crown
Financial, LLC Factoring Agreement   

On
August 3, 2016 we entered into an Agreement with Crown Financial, LLC which advances 80% of invoices approved and assumed by Crown
for collection. Depending on the length of time taken to collect the invoices we will receive additional payments from Crown ranging
from 18.25% if collected within 20 days to 0% if collected in 120 days. Crown has the right to require us to repurchase unpaid
invoices outstanding for more than 120 days. PIMCO has waived its security interest in invoices assigned to Crown.  

GHS
Investment Agreement   

On
August 13, 2016 we entered into an Investment Agreement (the  Investment Agreement ) with GHS Investments, LLC ( GHS ).
Although we are not mandated to sell shares under the Investment Agreement, the Investment Agreement gives us the option to sell
to GHS, up to $5,000,000 worth of our common stock ( Shares ), over the period following effectiveness of the registration
of a registration statement covering the resale of the Shares (the  Effective Date ) and ending thirty-six (36) months
after the Effective Date. Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, we have the right to deliver from time to time a Put Notice
to GHS stating the dollar amount of Put Shares (up to $500,000 under any individual Put Notice)(the  Put Amount )
that we intend to sell to GHS with the price per share based on the following formula: the lesser of (a) the lowest sale price
for the Common Stock on the date of the Put Notice (the  Put Notice Date ); or (b) the arithmetic average of the three
(3) lowest trading prices for the Company s Common Stock during the five trading days following the Put Notice Date. The
maximum number of shares that can be put to GHS is two times the average daily trading volume during the ten trading days prior
to the closing of a put (the  Closing Date ). If the amount of the tranche of our outstanding shares exceeds the volume
limitation, additional tranches will be delivered until the entire Purchase Amount is delivered. Each tranche, including the initial
tranche, will trigger a new purchase price, and will be priced according to the purchase price definition.  

In
addition, there is an ownership limit for GHS of 9.99% of our outstanding shares.  

On
any Closing Date, we shall deliver to GHS the number of shares of the Common Stock registered in the name of GHS as specified
in the Put Notice. In addition, we must deliver the other required documents, instruments and writings required. GHS is not required
to purchase the shares unless:  

Our
    Registration Statement with respect to the resale of the shares of Common Stock delivered in connection with the applicable
    Put shall have been declared effective.   

at
    all times during the period beginning on the date of the Put Notice and ending on the date of the related closing, our common
    stock has been listed on the Principal Market as defined in the Investment Agreement (which includes, among others, the OTC
    Market: QB Tier) and shall not have been suspended from trading thereon.   

we
    have complied with its obligations and is otherwise not in breach of or in default under the Investment Agreement, the Registration
    Rights Agreement or any other agreement executed in connection therewith;   

no
    injunction has been issued and remains in force, and no action has been commenced by a governmental authority which has not
    been stayed or abandoned, prohibiting the purchase or the issuance of the Put Shares; and   

the
    issuance of the Put Shares will not violate any shareholder approval requirements of the market or exchange on which our common
    stock is principally listed.   

GHS
will not engage in any  short-sale  (as defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO) of our common stock at any time during
this Agreement. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement with GHS, we agreed to pay a fee equaling $250,000 or 5%of the Commitment
Amount (the  Commitment Fee ) which shall be paid in installments of Fifty Thousand ($50,000) beginning on the earlier
of (i) the Effective Date of the Registration Statement and (ii) January 1, 2017 and, the first Trading Day of each January, April,
July and October thereafter until fully paid. Each installment of the Commitment Fee shall be paid either in cash or, at the election
of the Company, in shares of Common Stock, which shall be deemed a put under the Investment Agreement. On August 13, 2016, we
entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with GHS requiring, among other things that we prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 covering the resale of the shares issuable to GHS under the Investment Agreement. As per the Investment
Agreement, GHS  obligations are not assignable.  

Equity
Purchase Agreement with Kodiak Capital LLC   

On
December 17, 2014, we entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement ( Equity Purchase Agreement ) with Kodiak Capital
LLC. The Equity Purchase Agreement provides us with a financing (the  Financing  ) whereby the registrant can issue
and sell to Kodiak, from time to time, shares of our common stock (the  Put Shares  ) up to an aggregate purchase
price of $5.0 million (the  Maximum Commitment Amount ) during the Commitment Period (as defined below). Under the
terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, we have the right to deliver from time to time a Put Notice to Kodiak stating the dollar
amount of Put Shares (up to $500,000 under any individual Put Notice) that we intend to sell to Kodiak with the price per share
based on the following formula: seventy-five percent (75%) of the lowest closing bid price of our common stock during the period
beginning on the date of the Put Notice and ending five (5) days thereafter. Under the Equity Purchase Agreement, we may not deliver
the Put Notice until after the resale of the Put Shares has been registered pursuant to a registration statement filed with the

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

As

required by this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

As
of the end of our last fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon those evaluations, management concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016, to cause the information required to be disclosed by us in reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed
by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Going
forward from this filing, the Company intends to improve its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) that are designed to be effective
in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

During
the quarter covered by this Report, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
