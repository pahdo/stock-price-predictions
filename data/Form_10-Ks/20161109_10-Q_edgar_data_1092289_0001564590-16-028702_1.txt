   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
 (Unaudited)  
   
 1. General  
 Nature of operations  
 TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries,  we,   us,   our,  the  Company  or  TransAtlantic ) is an international oil and natural gas company engaged in acquisition, exploration, development and production. We have focused our operations in countries that have established, yet underexplored petroleum systems, are net importers of petroleum, have an existing petroleum transportation infrastructure and provide favorable commodity pricing, royalty rates and tax rates to exploration and production companies. We hold interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties in Turkey and Bulgaria. As of November 8, 2016, approximately 39% of our outstanding common shares were beneficially owned by N. Malone Mitchell 3rd, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors.  
 TransAtlantic is a holding company with two operating segments   Turkey and Bulgaria.  Its assets consist of its ownership interests in subsidiaries that primarily own assets in Turkey and Bulgaria, and an operated interest in a joint venture in Albania. 
 Basis of presentation  
 Our consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. Dollars and have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ). All amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated. In preparing financial statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management reviews estimates, including those related to fair value measurements associated with acquisitions and financial derivatives, the recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets, contingencies and income taxes. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reclassified certain balance sheet amounts previously reported on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 to conform to current year presentation.  
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

2. Going concern 
 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern. These principles assume that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our obligations in the normal course of operations for the foreseeable future. 
 We had net a loss of $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included net income from discontinued operations of $16.2 million.  At September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal amount of our debt was $87.4 million and we had a working capital deficit of $54.1 million. 
 On August 23, 2016, the Turkish branch of TransAtlantic Exploration Mediterranean International Pty Ltd ( TEMI ), entered into a general credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with DenizBank, A.S. ( DenizBank ).  On August 31, 2016, DenizBank entered into a $30.0 million term loan (the  Term Loan ) with TEMI under the Credit Agreement.  TEMI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TransAtlantic.   
 On September 7, 2016, TEMI used approximately $22.9 million of the proceeds from the Term Loan to repay in full (including accrued interest) the Company s senior credit facility (the  Senior Credit Facility ) with BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA ( BNP ) and the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ), which was terminated upon repayment.  In connection with the repayment of the Senior Credit Facility, the Company unwound its oil hedges with BNP, receiving proceeds of $2.6 million.  
 6 
 
    The Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% (plus 0.2625% for Banking and Insurance Transactions Tax per the Turkish government) per annum and is payable in six monthly installments of $1.25 m  illion each through February 2017 and thereafter in twelve monthly installments of $1.88 million each through February 2018.  The Term Loan matures in February 2018. Of the $28.8 million outstanding under the Term Loan at September 30, 2016, $19.4 million   is classified as short-term debt. In addition, the Company s $55.0 million of outstanding 13.0% convertible notes due 2017 (the  2017 Notes ) are due in full on July 1, 2017  .          
 Consequently, we will need some form of debt restructuring, capital raising effort or asset sale in order to fund our operations and meet our substantial debt service obligations of approximately $7.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 and $76.3 million in 2017.  As a result, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company continues to focus on the sale of assets to raise cash, capital raising and restructuring, and repaying or refinancing its debt obligations.  See Note 14.  Subsequent Events.  
 Management believes the going concern assumption to be appropriate for these consolidated financial statements. If the going concern assumption was not appropriate, adjustments would be necessary to the carrying values of assets and liabilities, reported revenues and expenses, and in the balance sheet classifications used in these consolidated financial statements. 

3. Recent accounting pronouncements  
 In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  ( ASU 2015-11 ), an amendment to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Subtopic 330-10.  The amendment states that entities should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The amendment does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method.  The amendment applies to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost.  ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2015-11 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ( ASU 2016-08 ).  ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of Topic 606 but clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  ASU 2016-08 is effective for the annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-08 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ).  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.  We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations. 
 In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ).  ASU 2016-10 does not change the core principle of Topic 606 but clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas.  ASU 2016-10 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-10 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  ( ASU 2016-13 ).  ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations. 
 7 
 
    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows   (Topic 230):     Classification of Certai  n Cash Receipts and Cash Payments     ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 provide guidance on specific cash flow issues including de  bt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payment  s made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions received from equity method investees. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and   interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.  
 We have reviewed other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if any, on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Based on that review, we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations.  

4. Property and equipment  
 Oil and natural gas properties  
 The following table sets forth the capitalized costs under the successful efforts method for our oil and natural gas properties as of:  

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we excluded $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, from the depletion calculation for proved development wells currently in progress and for costs associated with fields currently not in production.  
 At September 30, 2016, the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion, included $17.7 million relating to acquisition costs of proved properties, which are being depleted by the unit-of-production method using total proved reserves, and $91.2 million relating to well costs and additional development costs, which are being depleted by the unit-of-production method using proved developed reserves.  
 At December 31, 2015, the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties included $20.0 million relating to acquisition costs of proved properties, which are being amortized by the unit-of-production method using total proved reserves, and $111.4 million relating to well costs and additional development costs, which are being amortized by the unit-of-production method using proved developed reserves  
 Impairments of proved properties and impairment of exploratory well costs 
 Proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of such properties may not be recoverable. We primarily use Level 3 inputs to determine fair value, including but are not limited to, estimates of proved reserves, future commodity prices, the timing and amount of future production and capital expenditures and discount rates commensurate with the risk reflective of the lives remaining for the respective oil and natural gas properties. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $1.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of impairment of proved properties and exploratory well costs, which are primarily measured using Level 3 inputs.  We recorded $0.7 million of exploratory well costs related to the Guney Residere well during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.   
 8 
 
    Capitalized cost greater than one year   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $1.2 million and $2.1 million of exploratory well costs capitalized for the Hayrabolu-10 and Pinar-1 wells, respectively, in Turkey, which we spud in February 2013 and March 2014, respectively. The Hayrabolu-10 and Pinar-1 wells continue to be held for completion. 
 Equipment and other property  
 The historical cost of equipment and other property, presented on a gross basis with accumulated depreciation, is summarized as follows:  

As of September 30, 2016, we have classified $4.9 million of inventory as a current asset, which represents our expected consumption in the next twelve months.  We classify the remainder of our materials and supply inventory as a long-term asset because such materials will ultimately be classified as a long-term asset when the material is used in the drilling of a well.  
 At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we excluded $20.0 million and $21.3 million of inventory, respectively, from depreciation as the inventory had not been placed into service.  

5. Asset retirement obligations  
 The following table summarizes the changes in our asset retirement obligations ( ARO ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015:  

Our ARO is measured using primarily Level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs to this fair value measurement include estimates of plugging costs, remediation costs, inflation rate and well life. The inputs are calculated based on historical data as well as current estimated costs. 

6. Commodity derivative instruments  
 Historically, we have used derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of a portion of our future oil production. We have not designated the derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, and accordingly, we have recorded the derivative contracts at fair value and recognize changes in fair value in earnings as they occur.  
 9 
 
    To the extent that a legal right of offset exists, we net the value of our derivative contracts with the same counterp  arty in our consolidated balance sheets. All of our oil derivative contracts were settled based upon Brent crude oil pricing. We recognize gains and losses related to these contracts on a fair value basis in our consolidated statements of comprehensive inc  ome (loss) under the caption  (Loss) gain on commodity derivative contracts.  Settlements of derivative contracts are included in operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows under the caption  Cash settlement on commodity derivative c  ontracts.      
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a net loss on commodity derivative contracts of $0.2 million and a net gain of $24.9 million, respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a net loss on commodity derivative contracts of $2.4 million and a net gain of $25.4 million, respectively.  
 On September 7, 2016 and September 9, 2016, we unwound all of our existing crude oil hedges for the periods September 10, 2016 through March 31, 2019.  The unwinding of these hedging transactions resulted in proceeds of $2.6 million and was used for general corporate purposes.  See Note 14.  Subsequent Events  for more information.   
 At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding hedging contracts with respect to our future crude oil production as set forth in the table below:  
   
 Fair Value of Derivative Instruments as of December 31, 2015 

Balance sheet presentation  
 The following table summarizes both: (i) the gross fair value of our commodity derivative instruments by the appropriate balance sheet classification even when the commodity derivative instruments are subject to netting arrangements and qualify for net presentation in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015, and (ii) the net recorded fair value as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015.

    7. Loans payable   
   
 As of the dates indicated, our third-party debt consisted of the following:  

Senior Credit Facility  
 On May 6, 2014, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into the Senior Credit Facility with BNP Paribas and IFC. The Senior Credit Facility was guaranteed by us and each of TransAtlantic Petroleum (USA) Corp. ( TransAtlantic USA ) and TransAtlantic Worldwide, Ltd. ( TransAtlantic Worldwide ).  On August 31, 2016, TEMI entered into the Term Loan and, on September 7, 2016, we repaid the Senior Credit Facility in full and terminated it. 
 TEMI Term Loan 
 On August 23, 2016, the Turkish branch of TEMI entered into the Credit Agreement with DenizBank.  The Credit Agreement is a master agreement pursuant to which DenizBank may make loans to TEMI from time to time pursuant to additional loan agreements. 
   
 On August 31, 2016, DenizBank entered into the $30.0 million Term Loan with TEMI under the Credit Agreement.  In addition, the Company and DenizBank entered into additional agreements with respect to up to $20.0 million of non-cash facilities, including guarantee letters and treasury instruments for future hedging transactions.   
   
 On September 7, 2016, TEMI used approximately $22.9 million of the proceeds from the Term Loan to repay in full the Senior Credit Facility.   
   
 The Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% (plus 0.2625% for Banking and Insurance Transactions Tax per the Turkish government) per annum and is payable in six monthly installments of $1.25 million each through February 2017 and thereafter in twelve monthly installments of $1.88 million each through February 2018.  The Term Loan matures in February 2018.  Amounts repaid under the Term Loan may not be re-borrowed, and early repayments under the Term Loan are subject to early repayment fees.   
   
 The Term Loan is guaranteed by DMLP, Ltd. ( DMLP ), TransAtlantic Turkey, Ltd. ( TransAtlantic Turkey ), Talon Exploration, Ltd. ( Talon Exploration ) and TransAtlantic Worldwide (collectively, the  Guarantors ).  Each of the Guarantors is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.     
   
 The Term Loan contains standard prohibitions on the activities of TEMI as the borrower, including prohibitions on granting of liens on its assets, incurring additional debt, dissolving, liquidating, merging, consolidating, paying dividends, making certain investments, selling assets or transferring revenue, and other similar matters.  In addition, the Term Loan prohibits Amity Oil International Pty Ltd ( Amity ) and Petrogas Petrol Gaz ve Petrokimya Urunleri Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. ( Petrogas ) from incurring additional debt.  An event of default under the Term Loan includes, among other events, failure to pay principal or interest when due, breach of certain covenants, representations, warranties and obligations, bankruptcy or insolvency and the occurrence of a material adverse effect. 
   
 11 
 
    The Term Loan is secured by a pledge of (i) the stock of TEMI, DMLP, TransAtlantic Turkey and Talon Exploration, (ii) substantially all of the assets of TEMI, (iii) certain real estate owned by Petrogas, (iv) the Gundem real estate and Mura  tli real estate owned by Gundem Turizm Yatirim ve Isletmeleri A.S. ( Gundem ) and (v) the Diyarbakir real estate owned 80% by N. Malone Mitchell 3   rd    and 20%   by   Selami Erdem Uras.  In addition, TEMI assigned its Turkish collection accounts and its receivabl  es from the sale of oil to DenizBank as additional security for the Term Loan.  Gundem is beneficially owned by Mr. Mitchell, his adult children, and Mr. Uras.  Mr. Mitchell is our   c  hief   e  xecutive   o  fficer and   c  hairman of   our b  oard   of directors  .  Mr. Uras i  s our   v  ice   p  resident, Turkey.      
   
 At September 30, 2016, we had $28.8 million outstanding under the Term Loan and no availability, and were in compliance with the covenants in the Term Loan. 
 2017 Notes 
 As of  September  30, 2016, we had $55.0   million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2017 Notes.  The 2017 Notes bear interest at a rate of 13.0% per annum and mature on July 1, 2017. The 2017 Notes are convertible at any time, at the election of a holder, into our common shares at a conversion price of $6.80 per share.  
 On June 30, 2016, we issued 2,905,737 common shares in a private placement to certain holders of the 2017 Notes, at the election of such holders to receive common shares in lieu of cash interest on the 2017 Notes.  See Note 14.  Subsequent Events  for more information. 
 TBNG credit facility  
 Thrace Basin Natural Gas (Turkiye) Corporation ( TBNG ) had a fully-drawn credit facility with a Turkish bank.  On August 9, 2016, TBNG repaid the credit facility in full and terminated it.  
 West Promissory Notes 
 In August 2015, TransAtlantic USA entered into promissory notes (the  Promissory Notes ) with each of Mary West CRT 2 LLC and Gary West CRT 2 LLC, shareholders of the Company (collectively, the  Holders ), whereby TransAtlantic USA could borrow up to $1.5 million under each Promissory Note to fund our share repurchase program. The Holders are managed by Randy Rochman, an observer of our board of directors.  On September 9, 2016, the Promissory Notes were repaid in full with proceeds from the Term Loan and were terminated.  
 ANBE Note 
 On December 30, 2015, TransAtlantic USA entered into a $5.0 million draw down convertible promissory note (the  Note ) with ANBE Holdings, L.P. ( ANBE ), an entity owned by the adult children of Mr. Mitchell and controlled by an entity managed by Mr. Mitchell and his wife. The Note bears interest at a rate of 13.0% per annum.  On December 30, 2015, the Company borrowed $3.6 million under the Note (the  Initial Advance ) for general corporate purposes.  On June 30, 2016, the Company issued 355,826 common shares in a private placement to ANBE in lieu of paying cash interest on the Note.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had borrowed $3.6 million under the Note and had no availability.  
 Advances under the Note may be converted, at the election of ANBE, any time prior to the maturity of the Note into common shares of the Company.  The conversion price per common share for each advance is equal to 105% of the closing price of the Company s common shares on the NYSE MKT on the trading date immediately prior to such advance.  The conversion price of the Initial Advance is $1.3755 per share.  See Note 14.  Subsequent Events  for more information. 

8. Contingencies relating to production leases and exploration permits  
 Selmo  
 We are involved in litigation with persons who claim ownership of a portion of the surface at the Selmo oil field in Turkey. These cases are being vigorously defended by TEMI and Turkish governmental authorities. We do not have enough information to estimate the potential additional operating costs we would incur in the event the purported surface owners  claims are ultimately successful. Any adjustment arising out of the claims will be recorded when it becomes probable and measurable.  
 12 
 
    Morocco   
 During 2012, we were notified that the Moroccan government may seek to recover approximately $5.5 million in contractual obligations under our Tselfat exploration permit work program. In February 2013, the Moroccan government drew down our $1.0 million bank guarantee that was put in place to ensure our performance of the Tselfat exploration permit work program. Although we believe that the bank guarantee satisfies our contractual obligations, during 2012, we recorded $5.0 million in accrued liabilities relating to our Tselfat exploration permit for this contingency. In September 2016, management determined that, because it had received no communication from the Moroccan government since early 2013, the probability of payment of this contingency is remote, and therefore the Company reversed the $6.0 million in contingent liabilities previously classified as liabilities held for sale.    
 Bulgaria  
 During 2012, we were notified that the Bulgarian government may seek to recover approximately $2.0 million in contractual obligations under our Aglen exploration permit work program. Due to the Bulgarian government s January 2012 ban on fracture stimulation and related activities, a force majeure event under the terms of the exploration permit was recognized by the government. Although we invoked force majeure, we recorded $2.0 million in general and administrative expense relating to our Aglen exploration permit during 2012 for this contractual obligation. 
 In October 2015, the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy and Economy filed a suit against our subsidiary, Direct Petroleum Bulgaria EOOD ( Direct Bulgaria ), claiming a $200,000 penalty for Direct Bulgaria s alleged failure to fulfill the Aglen work program.  We believe that Direct Bulgaria is not under any obligation to fulfill the work program until the 2012 force majeure event is rectified and intend to vigorously defend this claim.  

9. Shareholders  equity  
   
 June 2016 share issuance 
   
 On June 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 5,773,305 common shares in private placements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). Of the 5,773,305 common shares, (i) 2,905,737 common shares were issued to holders of the 2017 Notes at the election of such holders to receive common shares in lieu of cash interest on the 2017 Notes; (ii) 355,826 common shares were issued to ANBE in lieu of cash interest on the Note; and (iii) 2,511,742 common shares were issued for cash, which was used to pay cash interest to certain holders of the 2017 Notes. All of the shares were issued at a value of $0.6599 per share, which was equal to 75% of the 10-day volume weighted average price through the close of trading of the common shares on the NYSE MKT on June 29, 2016. 
 Restricted stock units  
 We recorded non-cash share-based compensation expense of $0.1 million and $0.3 million for awards of restricted stock units ( RSUs ) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We recorded non-cash share-based compensation expense of $0.5 million and $0.8 million for awards of RSUs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $0.8 million of unrecognized non-cash compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.    
 Earnings per share  
 We account for earnings per share in accordance with ASC Subtopic 260-10,  Earnings Per Share  ( ASC 260-10 ). ASC 260-10 requires companies to present two calculations of earnings per share: basic and diluted. Basic earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 equals net income (loss) divided by the weighted average shares outstanding during the periods. Weighted average shares outstanding are equal to the weighted average of all shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested RSUs. Diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are computed in the same manner as basic earnings per common share after assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive common share equivalents, which includes RSUs.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were no dilutive securities included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.    
 13 
 
    The following table presents the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations:   

10. Segment information  
 In accordance with ASC 280,  Segment Reporting  ( ASC 280 ), we have two reportable geographic segments: Turkey and Bulgaria. Summarized financial information from continuing operations concerning our geographic segments is shown in the following table:  

14 

11. Financial instruments  
 Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and our loans payable were each estimated to have a fair value approximating the carrying amount at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, due to the short maturity of those instruments.  
 Interest rate risk  
 We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our variable rate short-term cash holdings.  
 Foreign currency risk  
 We have underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Our currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in the Canadian Dollar, Bulgarian Lev, European Union Euro, Romanian New Leu and Turkish Lira ( TRY ). We are also subject to foreign currency exposures resulting from translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiary financial statements into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency. We have not used foreign currency forward contracts to manage exchange rate fluctuations. At September 30, 2016, we had 47.6 million TRY (approximately $15.9 million) in cash and cash equivalents, which exposes us to exchange rate risk based on fluctuations in the value of the TRY.  
 Commodity price risk  
 We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices for oil and natural gas. Commodity prices are affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, supply and demand. At December 31, 2015, we were a party to commodity derivative contracts (see Note 6,  Commodity derivative instruments ).  
 Concentration of credit risk  
 The majority of our receivables are within the oil and natural gas industry, primarily from our industry partners and from government agencies. Included in receivables are amounts due from Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi, the national oil company of Turkey, and Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri A. ., a privately owned oil refinery in Turkey, which purchases all of our oil production. The receivables are not collateralized. To date, we have experienced minimal bad debts from customers in Turkey. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held by three financial institutions in the United States and Turkey.  
 Fair value measurements  
 The following table summarizes the valuation of our financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2016:  

At September 30, 2016, the fair values of the Term Loan and 2017 Notes were estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on unobservable Level 3 inputs, including our own credit risk associated with the loans payable. 
   
 15 
 
    The following table summarizes the valuation of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015:   

We remeasure our derivative contracts on a recurring basis, with changes flowing through earnings.  At December 31, 2015, the fair values of the Senior Credit Facility and 2017 Notes were estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on unobservable Level 3 inputs, including our own credit risk associated with the loans payable. 

12. Related party transactions  
 The following table summarizes related party accounts receivable and accounts payable as of the dates indicated:  

Services transactions 
 On March 3, 2016, Mr. Mitchell closed a transaction whereby he sold his interests in Viking Services B.V. ( Viking Services ), the beneficial owner of Viking International Limited ( Viking International ), Viking Petrol Sahasi Hizmetleri A.S. ( VOS ) and Viking Geophysical Services Ltd. ( Viking Geophysical ), to a third party.  As part of the transaction, Mr. Mitchell acquired certain equipment used in the performance of stimulation, wireline, workover and similar services, which equipment is owned and operated by Production Solutions International Petrol Arama Hizmetleri Anonim Sirketi ( PSIL ).  PSIL is beneficially owned by Dalea Investment Group, LLC, which is controlled by Mr. Mitchell. Consequently, on March 3, 2016, TEMI entered into a master services agreement (the  PSIL MSA ) with PSIL on substantially similar terms to the master services agreements with Viking International, VOS and Viking Geophysical.  Pursuant to the PSIL MSA, PSIL performs the services on behalf of TEMI and its affiliates.  The master service agreements with each of Viking International, VOS and Viking Geophysical will remain in effect through the remainder of the five-year term of the agreements ending on June 13, 2017. 
 16 
 
    Dalea Amended Note and Pledge Agreement  
 On April 19, 2016, we entered into a note amendment agreement (the  Note Amendment Agreement ) with Mr. Mitchell, and Dalea Partners, LP ( Dalea ), pursuant to which Dalea agreed to deliver an amended and restated promissory note (the  Amended Note ) in favor of us, in the principal sum of $7,964,053, which Amended Note would amend and restate that certain promissory note, dated June 13, 2012, made by Dalea in favor of us in the principal amount of $11.5 million (the  Original Note ). The Note Amendment Agreement reduced the principal amount of the Original Note to $8.0 million in exchange for the cancellation of an account payable of approximately $3.5 million (the  Account Payable ) owed by TransAtlantic Albania Ltd. ( TransAtlantic Albania ), a former subsidiary of the Company, to Viking International.  We have indemnified a third party for any liability relating to the payment of the Account Payable. 
 Pursuant to the Note Amendment Agreement, on April 19, 2016, we entered into the Amended Note, which amended and restated the Original Note that was issued in connection with our sale of our subsidiaries, Viking International and Viking Geophysical Services, to a joint venture owned by Dalea and Abraaj Investment Management Limited in June 2012. In the Amended Note, we and Dalea acknowledged that (i) while the sale of Dalea s interest in Viking Services enabled us to take the position that the Original Note was accelerated in accordance with its terms, the principal purpose of including the acceleration events in the Original Note was to ensure that certain oilfield services provided by Viking Services to us would continue to be available to us, and (ii) such services will now be provided pursuant to the PSIL MSA.  PSIL is beneficially owned by Dalea Investment Group, LLC, which is controlled by Mr. Mitchell. As a result, the Amended Note revised the events triggering acceleration of the repayment of the Original Note to the following: (i) a reduction of ownership by Dalea (and other controlled affiliates of Mr. Mitchell) of equity interest in PSIL to less than 50%; (ii) the sale or transfer by Dalea or PSIL of all or substantially all of its assets to any person (a  Transferee ) that does not own a controlling interest in Dalea or PSIL and is not controlled by Mr. Mitchell (an  Unrelated Person ), or the subsequent transfer by any Transferee that is not an Unrelated Person of all or substantially all of its assets to an Unrelated Person; (iii) the acquisition by an Unrelated Person of more than 50% of the voting interests of Dalea or PSIL; (iv) termination of the PSIL MSA other than as a result of an uncured default thereunder by TEMI; (v) default by PSIL under the PSIL MSA, which default is not remedied within a period of 30 days after notice thereof to PSIL; and (vi) insolvency or bankruptcy of PSIL. The maturity date of the Amended Note was extended to June 13, 2019. The interest rate on the Amended Note remains at 3.0% per annum and continues to be guaranteed by Mr. Mitchell.  The Amended Note contains customary events of default. 
   In addition, pursuant to the Note Amendment Agreement, on April 19, 2016, we entered into a pledge agreement (the  Pledge Agreement ) with Dalea, whereby Dalea pledged the $2.0 million principal amount of the 2017 Notes owned by Dalea (the  Dalea Convertible Notes ), including any future securities for which the Dalea Convertible Notes are converted or exchanged, as security for the performance of Dalea s obligations under the Amended Note. The Pledge Agreement provides that interest payable to Dalea under the Dalea Convertible Notes (or any future securities for which the Dalea Convertible Notes are converted or exchanged) will be credited first against the outstanding principal balance of the Amended Note and, upon full repayment of the outstanding principal balance of the Amended Note, any accrued and unpaid interest on the Amended Note. The Pledge Agreement contains customary events of default. 
 On June 30, 2016, we entered into a waiver with Dalea, whereby we waived our right under the Pledge Agreement to receive the interest payment due July 1, 2016 under the Dalea Convertible Notes in connection with the payment of 201,459 common shares to Dalea with respect to the 2017 Note interest payment paid on June 30, 2016. 
 Pledge fee agreements    
   
 In connection with the pledge of the Gundem real estate and Muratli real estate to DenizBank as collateral for the Term Loan, on August 31, 2016, the Company entered into a pledge fee agreement with Gundem (the  Gundem Fee Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company will pay Gundem a fee equal to 5% per annum of the collateral value of the Gundem real estate and Muratli real estate.  Pursuant to the Gundem Fee Agreement, the Gundem real estate has a deemed collateral value of $10.0 million and the Muratli real estate has a deemed collateral value of $5.0 million.     
   
 In connection with the pledge of the Diyarbakir real estate to DenizBank as collateral for the Term Loan, on August 31, 2016, the Company entered into a pledge fee agreement with Messrs. Mitchell and Uras (the  Diyarbakir Fee Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company will pay Messrs. Mitchell and Uras a fee of 5% per annum of the collateral value of the Diyarbakir real estate.  Pursuant to the Diyarbakir Fee Agreement, the Diyarbakir real estate has a deemed collateral value of $5.0 million.    
   
 Amounts payable to Mr. Mitchell under the Gundem Fee Agreement and the Diyarbakir Fee Agreement will be used to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the Amended Note. 
 17 
 
    Private placements  
 On June 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 5,773,305 common shares in private placements under the Securities Act. Of the 5,773,305 common shares, (i) 1,974,452 common shares were issued to Dalea, the trusts of Mr. Mitchell s four adult children and Pinon Foundation, a nonprofit entity controlled by Mrs. Mitchell, at their election to receive common shares in lieu of cash interest on the 2017 Notes; (ii) 355,826 common shares were issued to ANBE in lieu of cash interest on the Note and (iii) 814,627 common shares were issued to Dalea and the trusts of Mr. Mitchell s four adult children for cash, which was used to pay cash interest to certain holders of the 2017 Notes (see Note 9,  Shareholders  equity ). 
 Indemnity agreement 
 On May 9, 2016, Mr. Mitchell guaranteed the payment of director and officer liability premiums in the amount of $0.4 million   (the  Guaranteed Payments ) payable to US Premium Finance solely in the event of a change of control of the Company.  On May 9, 2016, we entered into an Indemnity Agreement with Mr. Mitchell pursuant to which we agreed to indemnify him for any damages he incurs related to the Guaranteed Payments. 

13. Discontinued operations 
 Discontinued operations in Albania  
 As of December 31, 2015, we classified our former Albania segment as assets and liabilities held for sale.  We have presented the operating results of our former Albanian segment within discontinued operations for all periods presented.   
 In February 2016, we sold all of the outstanding equity in Stream Oil   Gas Ltd. ( Stream ) to GBC Oil Company Ltd. ( GBC Oil ) in exchange for (i) the future payment of $2.3 million to Raiffeisen Bank Sh.A. ( Raiffeisen ) to pay down the term loan facility dated as of September 17, 2014 (the  Term Loan Facility ) between Stream s wholly-owned subsidiary, TransAtlantic Albania Ltd. ( TransAtlantic Albania ) and Raiffeisen, and (ii) the assumption of $29.2 million of liabilities owed by Stream, consisting of $23.1 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $6.1 million of debt.  TransAtlantic Albania owns all of our former Albanian oil assets and operations.  In addition, GBC Oil issued us a warrant pursuant to which we have the option to acquire up to 25% of the fully diluted equity interests in TransAtlantic Albania for nominal consideration at any time on or before March 1, 2019.   
 On September 1, 2016, the Company completed a joint venture transaction with respect to the assets in the Delvina gas field in Albania (the  Delvina Assets ). The Company transferred (the  Transfer ) 75% of the outstanding shares of Delvina Gas Company Ltd. ( DelvinaCo ), which owns the Delvina Assets, to Ionian Gas Company Ltd. ( Ionian ) in exchange for Ionian s agreement to pay $12.0 million to DelvinaCo, which will be used primarily to repay debt and for general corporate purposes with respect to the Delvina Assets. These payments will be made each quarter over an 18-month period, with the first payment of $1.0 million to be completed by November 2016.   As a result of this transaction, we have recorded a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $9.4 million during three and nine months ended September 2016.   
 After the Transfer, the Company retained a 25% equity interest in DelvinaCo and has agreed to pay 25% of the operating costs of DelvinaCo, subject to a three-year deferral of capital expenditures. For the next three years, Ionian will be responsible for all agreed upon capital expenditures with respect to the Delvina Assets. At the end of the three-year period, the Company will be required to either reimburse Ionian for its 25% share of such capital expenditures or face dilution in its ownership of DelvinaCo.   As of September 30, 2016, we no longer hold our 25% interest in DelvinaCo as assets held for sale, and have consolidated our interest using proportionate consolidation.      
 At December 31, 2015, TransAtlantic Albania s third-party debt consisted of the following: 

TransAtlantic Albania was a party to the Term Loan Facility with Raiffeisen.  The loan was scheduled to mature on December 31, 2016 and bore interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 5.5%, with a minimum interest rate of 7.0%. TransAtlantic Albania was required to pay 1/16th of the total commitment each quarter on the last business day of each of March, June, September and December each year. The loan was guaranteed by TransAtlantic Albania s parent company, Stream. TransAtlantic Albania could prepay the loan at its option in whole or in part, subject to a 3.0% penalty plus breakage costs.  The Term Loan Facility was secured by substantially all of the assets of TransAtlantic Albania.   
 18 
 
    As   of December 31, 2015, TransAtlantic Albania had $6.1 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and no availability.  As of December 31, 2015, TransAtlantic Albania was in default under the Term Loan Facility for failure to repay $1.1 million due on   December 31, 2015.  On February 29, 2016, we sold all the equity interest in Stream, the parent company of TransAtlantic Albania, to GBC Oil, who assumed the Term Loan Facility.  
   
 Discontinued operations in Morocco  
 On June 27, 2011, we decided to discontinue our operations in Morocco. We have substantially completed the process of winding down our operations in Morocco. We have presented the Moroccan segment operating results as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
 Assets and liabilities held for sale 
 The assets and liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2015 were as shown below.  As a result of the joint venture transaction related to the Delvina Assets and the reassessment of the Moroccan contingent liabilities, there were no remaining assets or liabilities held for sale at September 30, 2016.   

19 
 
    Results of discontinued operations  
 Our operating results from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows: 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we identified an error related to our deferred tax liability and deferred tax benefit that originated in prior periods and concluded that the error was not material to any of the previously reported periods or to the period in which the error was corrected. The impact of the error resulted in a decrease to our net loss from discontinued operations of $4.7 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. This immaterial error was corrected in our third quarter of 2015 results of operations for discontinued operations. 

14.  Subsequent Events  
 Sale of TBNG 
 On October 13, 2016, we entered into a share purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Valeura Energy Netherlands B.V. ( Valeura ) for the sale of all of the equity interests in TBNG, our wholly-owned subsidiary. TBNG owns a portion of the Company s interests in the Thrace Basin area in Turkey.   
 20 
 
    Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Valeura will pay $22.0 million to TransAtlantic   Worldwide, subject to purchase price adjustments for the period from March 31, 2016 (the effective date of the sale) through the closing date, in exchange for the transfer of all of the equity interests in TBNG.      
 The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification and termination rights of the parties.  The closing of the sale is subject to the satisfaction of  certain closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the sale by Valeura of certain assets to a third party.  The Company expects the transaction to close during the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.  However, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to close the sale of TBNG. 
 Extension of ANBE Note 
 On October 31, 2016, TransAtlantic USA entered into an amendment of the Note with ANBE (the  ANBE Amendment ).  The ANBE Amendment extends the maturity date of the Note from October 31, 2016 to September 30, 2017, provides for the Note to be repaid in four quarterly installments of $0.9 million each in December 2016 and March, June and September 2017, and provides for monthly payments of interest.  In addition, pursuant to the ANBE Amendment, if the sale of TBNG is completed prior to the extended maturity date of the Note, then the Company will repay the Note in full with proceeds from the sale of TBNG within five business days from the closing of the sale. 
 Offering of Series A Preferred Shares 
 On November 4, 2016, the Company issued 921,000 shares of its newly designated 12.0% Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Shares, par value $0.01 per share and liquidation preference of $50 per share (the  Series A Preferred Shares ), in private placements under the Securities Act.  Of the 921,000 Series A Preferred Shares, (i) 815,000 shares were issued in a private placement exchange offer (the  Exchange Offer ) to certain holders of the 2017 Notes, at an exchange rate of 20 Series A Preferred Shares for each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes, and (ii) 106,000 shares were issued and sold in a private placement (the  Private Offering ) to certain holders of the 2017 Notes.  All of the Series A Preferred Shares were issued at a value of $50.00 per share. Gross proceeds from the Private Offering were $5.3 million, which will be used by the Company to redeem $4.3 million of 2017 Notes and for general corporate purposes. The Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Shares contain a substantive conversion option and convert into a fixed number of common shares.  As a result, we will classify the Series A Preferred Shares within mezzanine equity in our consolidated balance sheet.  After completion of the Exchange Offer, $14.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes remain outstanding.  
   
 Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Shares (the  Certificate of Designations ), each Series A Preferred Share may be converted at any time (after approval of the listing of the common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares by the NYSE MKT and Toronto Stock Exchange) (the  Listing Condition ), at the option of the holder, into 45.754 common shares, par value $0.10 per share ( Common Shares ) of the Company (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $1.0928 per Common Share and is subject to customary adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations or other fundamental changes).  During the period ending on November 4, 2017, the conversion rate will be adjusted on an economic weighted average anti-dilution basis for the issuance of Common Shares for cash at a price below the conversion price then in effect.  Such anti-dilution protection shall exclude (i) dividends paid on the Series A Preferred Shares in Common Shares, (ii) issuances of Common Shares in connection with acquisitions, (iii) issuances of Common Shares under currently outstanding convertible notes and warrants and (iv) issuances of Common Shares in connection with employee compensation arrangements and employee benefit plans.  This non-standard dilution adjustment clause will result in a contingent beneficial conversion feature.        
 If not converted sooner, on November 4, 2024, the Company is required to redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares in cash at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends.  At any time on or after November 4, 2020, the Company may redeem all or a portion of the Series A Preferred Shares at the redemption prices listed below (expressed as a percentage of the liquidation preference amount per share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption, if the closing sale price of the Common Shares equals or exceeds 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 10 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in a period of 20 consecutive trading days, including the last trading day of such 20 trading day period, ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the business day on which the Company issues a notice of optional redemption. The redemption prices for the 12-month period starting on the date below are: 

21 
 
    Additionally, upon the occurrence of a change of control, the Company is required to offer to redeem the Series A   Preferred Shares within 120 days after the first date on which such change of control occurred, for cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.       
   
 Dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares are payable quarterly at the election of the Company in cash, Common Shares or a combination of cash and Common Shares at an annual dividend rate of 12.0% of the liquidation preference if paid all in cash or 16.0% of the liquidation preference if paid in Common Shares. If paid partially in cash and partially in Common Shares, the dividend rate on the cash portion shall be 12.0%, and the dividend rate on the Common Share portion shall be 16.0%.

            Management s Discussion and Analysis of   Financial Condition and Results of Operations      

 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to  we,   our,   us  or the  Company,  refer to TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis unless the context requires otherwise. Unless stated otherwise, all sums of money stated in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressed in U.S. Dollars.  
 Executive Overview  
 We are an international oil and natural gas company engaged in acquisition, exploration, development and production. We have focused our operations in countries that have established yet underexplored petroleum systems, are net importers of petroleum, have an existing petroleum transportation infrastructure and provide favorable commodity pricing, royalty rates and tax rates to exploration and production companies. As of September 30, 2016, we held interests in approximately 1.2 million net acres of developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties in Turkey and Bulgaria. As of November 8, 2016, approximately 39% of our outstanding common shares were beneficially owned by N. Malone Mitchell 3rd, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors. 
 TransAtlantic is a holding company with two operating segments   Turkey and Bulgaria.  Its assets consist of its ownership interest in subsidiaries that primarily own assets in Turkey and Bulgaria, and an operated interest in a joint venture in Albania. 
   
 Recent Developments 
 TEMI Term Loan .  On August 23, 2016, the Turkish branch of TransAtlantic Exploration Mediterranean International Pty Ltd ( TEMI ) entered into a general credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with DenizBank, A.S. ( DenizBank ).  On August 31, 2016, DenizBank entered into a $30.0 million term loan (the  Term Loan ) with TEMI under the Credit Agreement.  TEMI is one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.      
 On September 7, 2016, TEMI used approximately $22.9 million of the proceeds from the Term Loan to repay in full (including accrued interest) our senior credit facility (the  Senior Credit Facility ) with BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA ( BNP ) and the International Finance Corporation, which was terminated upon repayment.  In connection with repaying the Senior Credit Facility, we unwound our oil hedges with BNP, receiving proceeds of $2.6 million.  
 The Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% (plus 0.2625% for Banking and Insurance Transactions Tax per the Turkish government) per annum and is payable in six monthly installments of $1.25 million each through February 2017 and thereafter in twelve monthly installments of $1.88 million each through February 2018.  The Term Loan matures in February 2018.  
 Sale of TBNG .  On October 13, 2016, we entered into a share purchase agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Valeura Energy Netherlands B.V. ( Valeura ) for the sale of all of the equity interests in Thrace Basin Natural Gas (Turkiye) Corporation ( TBNG ), our wholly-owned subsidiary. TBNG owns a portion of our interests in the Thrace Basin area in Turkey.    
 Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Valeura will pay $22.0 million to TransAtlantic Worldwide, Ltd. ( TransAtlantic Worldwide ), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, subject to purchase price adjustments for the period from March 31, 2016 (the effective date of the sale) through the closing date, in exchange for the transfer of all of the equity interests in TBNG.   
 The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification and termination rights of the parties.  The closing of the sale is subject to the satisfaction of  certain closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the sale by Valeura of certain assets to a third party.  We expect the transaction to close during the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.  However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to close the sale of TBNG. 
 Extension of ANBE Note .  On October 31, 2016, TransAtlantic Petroleum (USA) Corp. ( TransAtlantic USA ), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into an amendment of a convertible promissory note (the  Note ) with ANBE Holdings, L.P. (the  ANBE Amendment ).  The ANBE Amendment extends the maturity date of the Note from October 31, 2016 to September 30, 2017, provides for the Note to be repaid in four quarterly installments of $0.9 million each in December 2016 and March, June and September 2017, and provides for monthly payments of interest.  In addition, pursuant to the ANBE Amendment, if the sale of TBNG is completed prior to the extended maturity date of the Note, then the Company will repay the Note in full with proceeds from the sale of TBNG within five business days from the closing of the sale.

    Offering of Series A Preferred Shares  .  On Nov  ember 4, 2016, we issued   921,000   shares of our newly designated 12.0% Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Shares, par value $0.01 per share and liquidation preference of $50 per share (the  Series A Preferred Shares ), in private placements under the   Securities Act of 1933.  Of the   921,000   Series A Preferred Shares, (i) 815,000 shares were issued in a private placement exchange offer (the  Exchange Offer ) to   certain   holders of our 13.0% convertible notes due 2017 (the  2017 Notes ), at an exchange ra  te of 20 Series A Preferred Shares for each $1,000 principal amount of 2017 Notes, and (ii)   106,000   shares were issued and sold in a private placement (the  Private Offering ) to certain   h  olders   of 2017 Notes  .  All of the Series A Preferred Shares were iss  ued at a value of $50  .00   per share. Gross proceeds from the Private Offering were approximately $  5.3   million  , which will be used by us   to redeem $4.3 million of 2017 Notes and   for general corporate purposes. After completion of the Exchange Offer, $14.3 mi  llion aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes remain outstanding.  The Series A Preferred Shares   will be   classified as mezzanine equity on our     balance sheet.  For more information on the terms of the Series A Preferred Shares, see  Note 14. Subsequent   Events  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  
 Going Concern     
 At September 30, 2016, we had (i) $78.0 million of short-term debt, consisting of $19.4 million due under the Term Loan, $3.6 million due under the Note and $55.0 million of 2017 Notes due on July 1, 2017, (ii) $20.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, and (iii) a working capital deficit of $54.1 million.  After the extension of the ANBE Note and the closing of the offering of Series A Preferred Shares, we have $37.3 million of short-term debt, consisting of $19.4 million due under the Term Loan, $3.6 million due under the Note and $14.3 million of 2017 Notes due on July 1, 2017, and we raised an additional $5.3 million of cash to redeem $4.3 million of 2017 Notes and for general corporate purposes.  In addition, we have entered into the Purchase Agreement to sell TBNG for $22.0 million, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.   
 Given the current market price for Brent crude, our working capital deficit and the amount of our short-term debt, we are focused on the following near-term business strategies: (i) consummating the sale of TBNG to raise cash to repay outstanding short-term indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, (ii) a development plan focused on maintaining our acreage position by drilling obligation wells and performing low cost, high return well optimizations, (iii) continued cost reduction measures to reduce our operating costs and general and administrative expenses, and (iv) raising additional cash for general corporate purposes, including our 2017 development plan.   
 These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements included in this report do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 Financial and Operational Performance Summary  
 The following is a summary of our financial and operational performance for the third quarter of 2016:  

We reported a $4.6 million net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016.     

We derived 87.4% of our oil and natural gas revenues from the production of oil and 12.6% from the production of natural gas during the three months ended September 30, 2016.     

Total oil sales decreased $0.2 million to $13.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from $13.7 million in the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a $2.09 decrease in the average price received per barrel of oil ( Bbl ) which resulted in lower revenues of $0.7 million.  This was partially offset by an increase in oil sales volumes of 13 thousand barrels of oil ( Mbbl ) which resulted in higher revenues of $0.5 million.     

Total natural gas sales decreased $1.9 million to $2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, from $3.9 million in the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales volumes of 256 million cubic feet of natural gas ( Mmcf ) which resulted in lower revenues of $1.8 million.  Additionally, the average price received decreased $0.27 per Mmcf of natural gas which resulted in lower revenues of $0.1 million.     

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $1.5 million in capital expenditures, including seismic and corporate expenditures, as compared to $7.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.

    Third Quarter 2016 Operational Update   
 During the third quarter of 2016, we drilled one well and continued workover and production optimizations in Southeast Turkey.  The following summarizes our operations by location during the third quarter of 2016:  
 Turkey-Southeast 
 In the Selmo and Bahar fields, we continued low cost well optimizations.  In Bahar, we ran electric submersible pumps in the Bahar-3 and Bahar-4 wells, which resulted in incremental production of 500 gross barrels of oil per day ( Bopd ).  We also completed facility upgrades and modifications in the Bahar field, and we are currently waiting for the arrival of power generation equipment, which will complete our electrification and gas utilization project.  In Selmo, we completed pipeline and facility upgrades, which allowed further optimization work to be undertaken.  As a result of this work, we added approximately 100 gross Bopd to our Selmo production. 
 Turkey-Northwest 
   
 In the Thrace Basin, we drilled one gross well, the Guney Reisdere-1 (50% working interest).  The well was spud on August 2, 2016 as part of our drilling obligations on licenses in our Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi ( TPAO )   joint venture.  The well reached a total depth of 9,243 feet.  Although various gas shows were seen while drilling, open-hole logs did not indicate commercial quantities of reservoir quality rock and we subsequently plugged and abandoned the well. 
 Bulgaria  
 We continue to evaluate our position with updated geologic models and continue to market a joint venture exploration program for our assets in Bulgaria.  
 Albania  
 On September 1, 2016, we completed a joint venture transaction with respect to the assets in the Delvina gas field in Albania.  We are the operator of the joint venture.  We have begun engineering and geologic work in order to restart production in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible. 
 Planned Operations for the fourth quarter 2016  
 We currently plan to execute the following activities under our reduced development plan during the remainder of 2016:  
 Turkey.  As a result of improved seismic interpretation and further engineering and geologic evaluation, we plan to drill or commence drilling between one and two wells during the remainder of 2016.  These wells will be located in our Selmo and Bahar fields in Southeast Turkey.  We are increasing the pumping capacity of the Bahar-1, Bahar-3 and Bahar-7 wells and the capacity to process and store oil.  We will also complete an initial gas-to-electricity facility to provide power to operate our field operations.    
 Bulgaria.   We plan to continue working on our geologic model for additional prospects and continue to market a joint venture exploration program for our assets in Bulgaria.  
 Albania.   We plan to complete our engineering evaluation required to restart production and then hold a meeting with our JV partner in the fourth quarter of 2016 to agree upon future operations and budgets, with the goal of expeditiously restoring production and further developing the Delvina gas field.  
 Discontinued Operations in Albania 
 In February 2016, we sold all of the outstanding equity in our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stream Oil   Gas Ltd. ( Stream ), to GBC Oil Company Ltd. ( GBC Oil ) in exchange for (i) the future payment of $2.3 million to Raiffeisen Bank Sh.A. ( Raiffeisen ) to pay down a term loan facility, and (ii) the assumption of $29.2 million of liabilities owed by Stream, consisting of $23.1 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $6.1 million of debt.  TransAtlantic Albania Ltd. ( TransAtlantic Albania ), Stream s wholly-owned subsidiary, owns all of our former Albanian oil assets and operations.  In addition, GBC Oil issued us a warrant pursuant to which we have the option to acquire up to 25% of the fully diluted equity interests in TransAtlantic Albania for nominal consideration at any time on or before March 1, 2019.   
 25 
 
    On September 1, 2016, we completed a joint venture transaction with respect to the assets in the Delvina gas fie  ld in Albania (the  Delvina Assets ). We transferred (the  Transfer ) 75% of the outstanding shares of Delvina Gas Company Ltd. ( DelvinaCo ), which owns the Delvina Assets, to Ionian Gas Company Ltd. ( Ionian ) in exchange for Ionian s agreement to pay $1  2.0 million, which will be used primarily to repay debt and for general corporate purposes with respect to the Delvina Assets. These payments will be made each quarter over an 18-month period, with the first payment of $1.0 million to be completed by Novem  ber 2016.    As a result of this transaction  ,   we have recorded a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $9.4 million during three and nine months ended September 2016.    
 After the Transfer, we retained a 25% equity interest in DelvinaCo and agreed to pay 25% of the operating costs of DelvinaCo, subject to a three-year deferral of capital expenditures. For the next three years, Ionian will be responsible for all agreed upon capital expenditures with respect to the Delvina Assets. At the end of the three-year period, we will be required to either reimburse Ionian for our 25% share of such capital expenditures or face dilution in our ownership of DelvinaCo.   As of September 30, 2016, we no longer hold our 25% interest in DelvinaCo as assets held for sale, and have consolidated our interest using proportionate consolidation.  
 Discontinued Operations in Morocco  
 In June 2011, we decided to discontinue our Moroccan operations. We have substantially completed the process of winding down our operations in Morocco. We have presented the Moroccan segment operating results as discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reversed a contingent liability of $6.3 million as it was deemed to no longer be probable of payment.   
 Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates  
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in  Note 3. Significant accounting policies  to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management. These estimates are based on historical experience, information received from third parties, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

    Results of Continuing Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 Our results of continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  

Oil and Natural Gas Sales.  Total oil and natural gas sales revenues decreased $2.1 million to $15.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $17.5 million realized in the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average realized price per barrel of oil equivalent ( Boe ) and reduced production.  Our average price received decreased $2.13 per Boe to $40.15 per Boe for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $42.28 per Boe for the same period in 2015.  Additionally, our average daily sales volumes decreased by 320 barrels of oil equivalent per day ( Boepd ) for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.  
 Production.  Production expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $3.1 million remained flat from the same period in 2015.   
 Exploration, Abandonment and Impairment.  Exploration, abandonment and impairment costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $2.2 million to $1.5 million, from $3.8 million for the same period in 2015.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $0.7 million of exploratory well costs related to the Guney Residere well.    
 27 
 
    General and Administrative.   General and admi  nistrative expense was $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $4.8 million for the same period in 2015.  Our general and administrative expenses decreased $2.2 million due to a $1.6 million decrease in personnel expenses, a   $0.3 million decrease in legal, accounting and other services and a decrease in office and travel expenses of $0.3 million.  
 Depletion.  Depletion decreased to $6.9 million, or $15.70 per Boe, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $7.5 million, or $15.90 per Boe, for the same period of 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our production during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.     
 Interest and Other Expense.  Interest and other expense increased to $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the write-off of $0.5 million of deferred financing costs associated with our former Senior Credit Facility, which we repaid during the quarter.  
 Interest and Other Income.  Interest and other income increased to $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2015.  This was primarily due to the sale of our Edirne gas gathering system and facilities, resulting in a gain of $0.7 million.   
 Foreign Exchange Loss.  We recorded a foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a loss of $1.2 million in the same period in 2015. The foreign exchange loss is primarily unrealized (non-cash) in nature and results from re-measuring specific transactions and monetary accounts in a currency other than the functional currency. For example, a U.S. Dollar transaction which occurs in Turkey is re-measured at the period-end to the New Turkish Lira ( TRY ) amount if it has not been settled previously. The foreign exchange loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due to a 3.5% decrease in the value of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar, versus an 11.0% decrease in the value of the TRY for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 (Loss) Gain on Commodity Derivative Contracts.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss on commodity derivative contracts of $0.2 million, as compared to a net gain of $24.9 million for the same period in 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a $2.9 million loss to mark our commodity derivative contracts to their fair value and a $2.7 million gain on settled contracts. During the same period in 2015, we recorded a $4.6 million gain to mark our derivative contracts to their fair value and a $20.3 million gain on settled contracts.  
 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).  We record foreign currency translation adjustments from the process of translating the functional currency of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency.  Foreign currency translation adjustment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to a loss of $4.0 million from a loss of $21.7 million for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in foreign currency translation loss in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due to a 3.5% decrease in the value of the TRY as compared to the U.S. Dollar, versus an 11.0% decrease in the value of the TRY for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 28 
 
    Discontinued Operations.   All revenues and expenses associated with our Albanian and Moroccan operations have been classified as discontinued operati  ons.  Our operating results from discontinued operations in Albania and Morocco are summarized as follows:

    R  esults of Continuing Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   
 Our results of continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

Oil and Natural Gas Sales.  Total oil and natural gas sales revenues decreased $21.3 million to $46.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $67.5 million realized in the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average realized price per Boe and reduced production.  Our average price received decreased $11.14 per Boe to $37.98 per Boe for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $49.12 per Boe for the same period in 2015.  Additionally, our average daily sales volumes decreased 594 Boepd for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.  
 Production.  Production expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to $9.0 million, or $6.50 per Boe, from $10.1 million, or $6.41 per Boe, for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in Turkey was primarily due to fewer workovers, reduced headcount and successful cost-cutting measures in our field operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.  
 Exploration, Abandonment and Impairment.  Exploration, abandonment and impairment costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $5.2 million to $3.0 million, from $8.2 million for the same period in 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred proved property impairment of $1.4 million and exploratory well costs associated with the Guney Residere well of $0.7 million.    
 30 
 
    General and Administrative.   General and administrative expense was $11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $18.7 million for the same peri  od in 2015.  Our general and administrative expenses decreased $7.3 million due to a $6.4 million decrease in personnel expenses, a $0.6 million decrease in office expenses and a $0.3 million decrease in travel expenses.  
 Depletion.  Depletion decreased to $21.7 million, or $16.65 per Boe, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $26.2 million, or $16.71 per Boe, for the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the net book value of our Goksu field to zero during 2015, which resulted in lower depletion expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Interest and Other Expense.  Interest and other expense decreased to $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to our lower average debt balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015.  
 Interest and Other Income.  Interest and other income increased to $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.7 million for the same period in 2015.  This was primarily due to the sale of our Edirne gas gathering system and facilities, resulting in a gain of $0.7 million.  
 Foreign Exchange Loss.  We recorded a foreign exchange loss of $0.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a loss of $6.9 million in the same period in 2015. The foreign exchange loss is primarily unrealized (non-cash) in nature and results from re-measuring specific transactions and monetary accounts in a currency other than the functional currency. For example, a U.S. Dollar transaction which occurs in Turkey is re-measured at the period-end to the TRY amount if it has not been settled previously. The foreign exchange loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to a 3.0% decrease in the value of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar, versus a 31.2% decrease in the value of the TRY for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 (Loss) Gain on Commodity Derivative Contracts.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss on commodity derivative contracts of $2.4 million, as compared to a net gain of $25.4 million for the same period in 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a $6.6 million loss to mark our commodity derivative contracts to their fair value and a $4.2 million gain on settled contracts. During the same period in 2015, we recorded a $2.1 million loss to mark our derivative contracts to their fair value and a $27.6 million gain on settled contracts.  
 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).  We record foreign currency translation adjustments from the process of translating the functional currency of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency.  Foreign currency translation adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to a loss of $3.3 million from a loss of $50.3 million for the same period in 2015.  The change in foreign currency translation adjustments in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to a 3.0% decrease in the value of the TRY as compared to the U.S. Dollar, versus a 31.2% decrease in the value of the TRY for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $1.5 million in capital expenditures, including seismic and corporate expenditures, as compared to $7.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was due to our planned reduction in capital expenditures during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $4.7 million in capital expenditures, including seismic and corporate expenditures, as compared to $18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was due to our planned reduction in capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
 We expect our net field capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 to range between $2.5 million and $4.5 million in Turkey for new wells and low cost, high return well optimizations. We do not anticipate material capital expenditures in Bulgaria during the remainder of 2016. We expect cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our remaining 2016 net field capital expenditures. If not, we will either curtail our discretionary capital expenditures or seek other funding sources. Our projected 2016 capital expenditure budget is subject to change. 
 Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $19.6 million, a decrease from net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $52.9 million during the same period in 2015, due primarily to a decrease in our oil and natural gas sales and a decrease in cash settlements on our commodity derivative contracts.  Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $2.7 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $23.6 million for the same period in 2015, due primarily to a decrease in drilling operations in light of the low oil price environment.  Additionally, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7.8 million, a decrease from net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations of $13.9 million for the same period in 2015, due primarily to a decrease in our net borrowings and higher loan repayments in 2016.   
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 On a consolidated basis, as of September 30, 2016, we had $87.4 million of indebtedness, not including $14.5 million of trade payables, as further described below.  We believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements and to fund planned capital expenditures during the next twelve months.

    Outstanding Debt  
 At September 30, 2016, we had the Term Loan, the Note and 2017 Notes outstanding, all of which are discussed below. 
   
 Term Loan.   On August 31, 2016, DenizBank entered into the $30.0 million Term Loan with TEMI.  In addition, the Company and DenizBank entered into additional agreements with respect to up to $20.0 million of non-cash facilities, including guarantee letters and treasury instruments for future hedging transactions.  On September 7, 2016, TEMI used approximately $22.9 million of the proceeds from the Term Loan to repay in full the Senior Credit Facility.    
   
 The Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% (plus 0.2625% for Banking and Insurance Transactions Tax per the Turkish government) per annum and is payable in six monthly installments of $1.25 million each through February 2017 and thereafter in twelve monthly installments of $1.88 million each through February 2018.  The Term Loan matures in February 2018.  Amounts repaid under the Term Loan may not be re-borrowed, and early repayments under the Term Loan are subject to early repayment fees.   
   
 The Term Loan is guaranteed by DMLP, Ltd. ( DMLP ), TransAtlantic Turkey, Ltd. ( TransAtlantic Turkey ), Talon Exploration, Ltd. ( Talon Exploration ) and TransAtlantic Worldwide (collectively, the  Guarantors ).  Each of the Guarantors is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.     
   
 The Term Loan contains standard prohibitions on the activities of TEMI as the borrower, including prohibitions on granting of liens on its assets, incurring additional debt, dissolving, liquidating, merging, consolidating, paying dividends, making certain investments, selling assets or transferring revenue, and other similar matters.  In addition, the Term Loan prohibits Amity Oil International Pty Ltd ( Amity ) and Petrogas Petrol Gaz ve Petrokimya Urunleri Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. ( Petrogas ) from incurring additional debt.  An event of default under the Term Loan includes, among other events, failure to pay principal or interest when due, breach of certain covenants, representations, warranties and obligations, bankruptcy or insolvency and the occurrence of a material adverse effect. 
   
 The Term Loan is secured by a pledge of (i) the stock of TEMI, DMLP, TransAtlantic Turkey and Talon Exploration, (ii) substantially all of the assets of TEMI, (iii) certain real estate owned by Petrogas, (iv) the Gundem real estate and Muratli real estate owned by Gundem Turizm Yatirim ve Isletmeleri A.S. ( Gundem ) and (v) the Diyarbakir real estate owned 80% by N. Malone Mitchell 3 rd  and 20% by Selami Erdem Uras.  In addition, TEMI assigned its Turkish collection accounts and its receivables from the sale of oil to the Lender as additional security for the Term Loan.  Gundem is beneficially owned by Mr. Mitchell, his adult children, and Mr. Uras.  Mr. Mitchell is our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors.  Mr. Uras is our vice president, Turkey.   
   
 At September 30, 2016, we had $28.8 million outstanding under the Term Loan and no availability, and we were in compliance with the covenants in the Term Loan. 
 2017  Notes.    At September 30, 2016, we had $ 55.0    million aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes.     The 2017 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 13.0% per annum.  Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on January 1 and July 1 of each year.  The 2017 Notes mature on July 1, 2017.  The 2017 Notes are convertible at any time, at the election of a holder, into our common shares at a conversion price of $6.80 per share. 
 On November 4, 2016, we exchanged $40.8 million of 2017 Notes for 815,000 of our Series A Preferred Shares.  After the consummation of the Exchange Offer, we had $14.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes outstanding.  In addition, we expect to redeem $4.3 million of 2017 Notes with the proceeds of our offering of Series A Preferred Shares.   
 ANBE Note . On December 30, 2015, TransAtlantic USA entered into the Note with ANBE Holdings, L.P. ( ANBE ), an entity owned by the adult children of Mr. Mitchell and controlled by an entity managed by Mr. Mitchell and his wife. The Note bears interest at a rate of 13.0% per annum.  On December 30, 2015, the Company borrowed $3.6 million under the Note (the  Initial Advance ) for general corporate purposes.  As of September 30, 2016, we had borrowed $3.6 million under the Note and had no availability.    
 Advances under the Note may be converted, at the election of ANBE, into common shares any time prior to the maturity of the Note.  The conversion price per common share for each advance is equal to 105% of the closing price of the Company s common shares on the NYSE MKT on the trading date immediately prior to such advance.  The conversion price of the Initial Advance is $1.3755 per share. 
 33 
 
    On October 31, 2016, TransAtlantic   USA entered into the ANBE Amendment.  The ANBE Amendment extends the maturity date of the Note from October 31, 2016 to September 30, 2017, provides for the Note to be repaid in four quarterly installments of $0.9 million each in December 2016 and March,   June and September 2017 and provides for monthly payments of interest.  In addition, pursuant to the ANBE Amendment, if the sale of TBNG is completed prior to the extended maturity date of the Note, then the Company will repay the Note in full with proceed  s from the sale of TBNG within five business days from the closing of the sale.   
 Contractual Obligations 
 The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 and have been adjusted to reflect our subsequent events described in  Note 14. Subsequent Events .

 Represents the redemption amount of the Series A Preferred Shares payable on November 4, 2024 and assumes no conversion of the Series A Preferred Shares into Common Shares or redemption of the Series A Preferred Shares, in each case, prior to November 4, 2024.     

(2)   
 
 Dividends on the Series A Preferred Shares may be paid by the Company, in its sole discretion, in cash at a rate of 12% per annum or in common shares at a rate of 16% per annum or in a combination of cash and common shares.  The amounts in the table assume that the Company pays all future dividend payments solely in cash.

   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk    

 Our derivative contracts may expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our counterparty.  While collateral is generally not required to be posted by counterparties, credit risk associated with derivative instruments is minimized by entering into derivative instruments only with creditworthy counterparties that are generally large financial institutions. Additionally, master netting agreements are used to mitigate risk of loss due to default with counterparties on derivative instruments. These agreements allow us to offset our asset position with our liability position in the event of default by the counterparty. 
 During the third quarter of 2016, other than the unwind of our hedges with BNP upon repayment of the Senior Credit Facility, there were no material changes in market risk exposures or their management that would affect the Quantitative or Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The following tables set forth our derivatives contracts which were entered into with DenizBank on October 6, 2016, and are settled based on Brent crude oil pricing:

       Controls and Procedures    

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
 34 
 
    As of Septembe  r 30, 2016, management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and   15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.   
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurances of achieving their control objectives.  
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES  
 The following table sets forth our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. You should read this ratio in connection with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Because we did not have preferred stock outstanding during this period, our ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends for any given period is equivalent to our ratio of earnings to fixed charges. 

For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges,  earnings  represents income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes plus fixed charges.  Fixed charges  includes interest expense, capitalized interest, amortization of discount and capitalized expenses related to indebtedness and the portion of rental expense that management believes is representative of the interest component of rental expense. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges presented in this Form 10-Q may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be comparable to corresponding measures used in our various agreements, including the Senior Credit Facility.
