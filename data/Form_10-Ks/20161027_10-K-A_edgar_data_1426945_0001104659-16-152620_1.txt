EXPLANATORY NOTE   
     
  This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (the  Amendment ) amends the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Echo Global Logistics, Inc. (the  Company ) for the year ended December 31, 2015, originally filed on February 26, 2016 (the  Original Filing ). The Company is filing the Amendment solely to (i) amend and restate in its entirety the opinion of the Company s independent auditor with respect to the Company s internal control over financial reporting included in Item 8 of the Original Filing to correct clerical errors included in the text of such opinion and (ii) incorporate such opinion, as revised, into Item 9A.  This Amendment does not amend and restate any other portions of Item 8 or Item 9A of the Original Filing other than those set forth in this Amendment.  Except as expressly set forth herein, this Amendment does not reflect events occurring after the date of the Original Filing or modify or update any of the other disclosures contained therein in any way. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with the Original Filing and the Company s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This Amendment consists solely of the preceding cover page, this explanatory note, amendments to Part II Item 8 and Part II Item 9, the signature page, and the certifications required to be filed as exhibits to this Amendment.

PART II   
     
   Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   
     
  The opinion of the Company s independent auditor with respect to the Company s internal control over financial reporting is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:  
     
   Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   
     
  The Board of Directors and Stockholders of  
  Echo Global Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries  
     
  We have audited Echo Global Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Echo Global Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries  management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Echo Global Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries  internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  
     
  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
     
  A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
     
  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
     
  As indicated in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Command Transportation, LLC ( Command ), which is included in the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Echo Global Logistics. Command constituted 57% of total assets as of December 31, 2015 and 19% and 14% of revenue and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Echo Global Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Command.  
     
  In our opinion, Echo Global Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.  
     
 2   

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Echo Global Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Echo Global Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries, and our report dated February 26, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
